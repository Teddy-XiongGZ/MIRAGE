B: Normal HbF and normal HbA2Alpha (0) thalassemia -Individuals with this disorder are not able to produce any functional alpha-globin and thus are unable to make any functional hemoglobin A, F, or A2. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis, also known as hemoglobin Ba, a condition that is incompatible with extra uterine life.Alpha (+) thalassemia - genetic mutations that result in decreased production of alpha-globin usually due to the functional deletion of 1 of the 4 alpha globin genes. Based on the number of inherited alpha genes, it is subclassified into 3 general forms:Thalassemia (-u\/ a a) is characterized by inheritance of 3 normal a-genes. These patients are referred to clinically as silent carrier of alpha thalassemia. Other names for this condition are alpha thalassemia minima, alpha thalassemia-2 trait, and heterozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia minor. The affected individuals exhibit no abnormality clinically and may be hematologically normal or have mild reductions in red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of 2 normal alpha genes due to either heterozygosity for alpha (0) thalassemia (u a\/ --) or homozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia (-u\/-a) results in the development of alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia-1 trait. The affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia and reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of one normal alpha gene (-a\/ --) results in abundant formation of hemoglobin H.

{"question":"A child is admitted on 7 days of life with severe respiratory distress and shock. He was discharged 2 days back healthy. What could be the probable diagnosis \u2013","exp":"livpolastic left heart syndrome \n\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).\nHypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.\nThe problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:\n\n(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body\nEntrace and exit of the ventricle\nMitral and aortic valves\n\nThis causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.\nIn patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\nThe only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic\n\narteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two\nof these connections:\n(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)\nDuctus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)\n\nBoth of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.\nIn babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.\nBabies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.\nBecause there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).\n\nSymptoms\n\nAt first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:\n\n\nBluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color\nCold hands and feed (extremities)\n\n\nLethargy\n\n\nPoor pulse\nPoor suckling and feeding\nPounding heart\nRapid breathing\nShortness of breath.\nSince the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.\nSigns of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.\n\nVentricular septal defect\n\nThese patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.\nThey usually present with congestive cardiac failure.\n\nEbstein's anomaly \n\nEbstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.\nThese patients usually present in teenage\/adolescent years.\nThey may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.\n\nAorticopulmonary window defect\n\nAn Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.\nIn these cases minimal cyanosis is present and they may present with heart failure in infancy.","cop":2,"opa":"VSD large","opb":"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome","opc":"Ebstein anomaly","opd":"AP window defect","subject_name":"Pediatrics","topic_name":null,"id":"2e78ce60-b4af-41c4-b2bd-595a6e728c1d","choice_type":"single"}

The major effect of coicosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription. Coicosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of IQ-receptors.

The 2 most common symptoms are usually fever and flank pain. E. coli is the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis due to its unique ability to adhere to and colonize the urinary tract and kidneys.Histopathology will usually reveal necrosis or putrid abscess formation within the renal parenchyma. The renal tissues are infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages and plasma cells. However, architecture is not completely disorganized.The presence of white blood cells within or upon casts strongly suggests pyelonephritis, direct infection of the kidney.

Reason for this restriction is that sholy after action potential is initiated, the sodium channels (or calcium channels \/ both) become inactivated & no amount of excitatory signal applied to these channels at this point will open inactivated gates. Only condition that will allow them to reopen is when membrane potential returns to or gets close to original resting membrane potential level. Then, within another small fraction of second, inactivated gates of channels open & new action potential can be initiated This period for large myelinated nerve fibers is about 1\/2500 second thus, such fibers can transmit maximum of about 2500 impulses per second - Na have 2 gates, activated gate & an inactivated gate.

Now here let\u2019s take a look at its management.\\\nManagement of DIC\n\nThe most important step is to terminate the pregnancy- vaginal delivery without episiotomy is preferred to cesarean section\nVolume replacement by crystalloids or colloids will reduce the amount of whole blood needed to restore the blood volume.\n500 ml of fresh blood raises the fibrinogen level approximately by 12.5 mg\/100 ml and platelets by 10,000\u201315,000 cu mm. Fresh blood- helps in flushing out fibrin degradation product and improving the micro circulation.\nTo replace fibrinogen- Fresh frozen plasma should be given: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is extracted from whole blood. It contains fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, clotting factors V, XI, XII. FFP transfusion provides both volume replacement and coagulation factors. One unit of FFP (250 mL) raises the fibrinogen by 5-10 mg\/dL. FFP does not need to be ABO or Rh compatible.\nCryoprecipitate is obtained from thawed FFP. It is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, Von Willebrand\u2019s factor, and XIII. Cryoprecipitate provides less volume (40 mL) compared to FFP (250 mL). So it should not be used for volume replacement. One unit of cryoprecipitate increases the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg\/dL.\nIn case of active bleeding with platelet counts < 50,000\/ml or prophylactically with platelet count 20\u201330,000\/ml \u2013 platelet replacement should be done. Platelet should ABO and Rh specific. 1 units (50 ml) raises the platelet count by 7500\/ ml\nRecombinant activated factors VIIA: (60-100 \u03bcg\/kg IV) can reverse DIC within 10 minute as it is a precusor for extrinsic clotting cascade which is replaced.\nRole of Heparin\n\nAccording to Williams Obs. \u201cHeparin is not used in DIC.\u201d\nAccording to COGDT 10\/e, p 999\n\u201cHeparin acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III but has little effect on activated coagulation factors. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with fulminant DIC and central nervous system insults, fulminant liver failure, or obstetric accidents. The one instance, however, in which heparin has been demonstrated to benefit pregnancy-related DIC is in the case of the retained dead fetus with intact vascular system, where heparin may be administered to interrupt the coagulation process and thrombocytopenia for several days until delivery may be implemented.\u201d\nAs far as EACA is concerned- Williams Obs. 22\/e, p 844 says \u2013\n\u201cEACA is not recommended in case of DIC.\u201d\nAccording to Williams Obs 23\/e, p 787\n\u201cIt use in most types of obstetric coagulopathy has not been efficacious & not recommended\u201d","cop":2,"opa":"Heparin","opb":"Epsilon amino caproic acid","opc":"Blood transfusion","opd":"Intravenous fluids.","subject_name":"Gynaecology & Obstetrics","topic_name":null,"id":"eb49deaf-5611-4a19-8ad5-0cca73608043","choice_type":"single"}

{"question":"Doc of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is","exp":"- Metronidazole is drug of choice for bacterial vaginosis ( with or without pregnancy )- Alternative to metronidazole is clindamycin.- Rovamycin i.e. spiramycin (which is a macrolide) is drug of choice for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. Metronidazole -* It is the prototype nitroimidazole having broad-spectrum cidal activity against anaerobic protozoa, including Giardia lamblia , trichomonas and amoeba. * Many anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria, such as Bact. fragilis, Fusobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, peptococci, spirochetes and anaerobic Streptococci are sensitive. * Metronidazole does not affect aerobic bacteria. Mechanism of action- After entering the cell by diffusion, its nitro group is reduced by ceain redox proteins operative only in anaerobic microbes to a highly reactive nitro radical which exes cytotoxicity. The nitro radical of metronidazole acts as an electron sink which competes with the biological electron acceptors of the anaerobic organism for the electrons generated by the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway of pyruvate oxidation. The energy metabolism of anaerobes that have no mitochondria is thus, disrupted. Aerobic environment attenuates cytotoxicity of metronidazole by inhibiting its reductive activation. Moreover, O2 competes with the nitro radical of metronidazole for the free electrons generated during energy metabolism of anaerobes. Metronidazole, in addition, has been found to inhibit cell mediated immunity, to induce mutagenesis and to cause radiosensitization.

{"question":"All of the following are induction agents except:September 2007","exp":"Ans. C: Nitrous oxideGeneral anaesthesia can be induced by intravenous (IV) injection, or breathing a volatile anaesthetic through a facemask (inhalational induction).Onset of anaesthesia is faster with IV injection than with inhalation, taking about 10-20 seconds to induce total unconsciousness.This has the advantage of avoiding the excitatory phase of anaesthesia, and thus reduces complications related to induction of anaesthesia.An inhalational induction may be chosen by the anesthesiologist where IV access is difficult to obtain, where difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or due to patient preference (e.g. children).Commonly used IV induction agents include propofol, sodium thiopental, etomidate, and ketamine.The most commonly-used agent for inhalational induction is sevoflurane because it causes less irritation than other inhaled gasesIn order to prolong anaesthesia for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained.

However, even low-dose pills pose significant risk in women > 35 years of age, diabetics, hypertensives and in those who smoke.

{"question":"Major mechanism of action of nitrates in acute attack of angina is:-","exp":"Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload.

Irradiation - reduces the chance of development of Graft Versus Host Disease. Irradiation - causes - reduction in the number of the immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes mainly) Irradiation of cellular blood components (red blood cells, platelets, and granulocytes) is indicated to prevent the development of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Patients at risk of TA-GVHD include immunocompromised patients who are receiving a bone marrow or stem cell transplant and fetuses undergoing an intrauterine transfusion. Irradiation is also indicated for recipients of components collected from a blood relative or HLA-matched donors. 3. Leukocyte reduction - Leukoreduction of whole blood and blood components has been shown to reduce recurrent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, reduce alloimmunization to leukocyte antigens that may complicate care of patients whoundergo transplantation or chronic transfusion therapy, and protect against transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to patients at increased risk of CMV disease. antibodies in the recipient - react with donor leukocytes - release of cytokines - cause fever- known as Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction. 4.

{"question":"Reticulocytosis is seen in:","exp":"Red cell precursors formed in the bone marrow from the erythroid (CFU\u2013E) progenitor cells are called erythroblasts or normoblasts. These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The \ufb01rst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (\u2018polychromasia\u2019). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.\nProliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no\u00a0 915","cop":1,"opa":"Hemolytic anemia","opb":"Megaloblastic anemia","opc":"Aplastic anemia","opd":"Iron deficiency anemia","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":null,"id":"4473f818-6954-484c-a9c9-48e5abd409df","choice_type":"single"}

B: Obstruction of lymphatic ductsInflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a very aggressive type of breast cancer in which the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast.This type of breast cancer is called \"inflammatory\" because the breast often looks swollen and red, or \"inflamed\", sometimes overnight, and can be misdiagnosed as mastitis.Invasion of the local lymphatic ducts impairs drainage and causes edematous swelling of the breast. Because the skin of the breast is tethered by the suspensory ligament of Cooper, the accumulation of fluid may cause the skin of the breast to assume a dimpled appearance similar to an orange peel (peau d'orange).IBC is sometimes misdiagnosed as an insect bite or breast infection.

If the tooth is dirty, an attempt should be made to clean the root surface, but it is very important to preserve any remnants of the periodontal ligament that are still attached to the root. 'therefore the parent would then be instructed to keep the tooth immersed in a suitable storage medium and bring the child and the tooth for immediate care.\nThe patient should receive immediate attention after arriving at the dental office; and if it seems any contamination than it should be rinse thoroughly with saline only do not attempt to scrub tooth by any means to prevent vitality of periodontal fibers and re-implant it in socket.\nIf patient or parent cannot or will not replant it than procedure to maintain vitality of tooth\nAllowing the avulsed tooth to dehydrate before replantation is damaging to a favourable prognosis.\nHanks buffered saline, isotonic saline, and pasteurized bovine milk may be the most favourable known storage media.

Presumably, the patient's saliva (and perhaps blood) would be readily available.\nAlthough tap water has been a commonly recommended storage solution (and its use would be preferable to allowing dehydration of the tooth), saliva is a better storage medium.

{"question":"Drug acting on cell wall of gram positive bacteria:March 2009","exp":"Ans. D: VancomycinVancomycins bind to the peptides of the peptidoglycan monomers and block both the formation of gycosidic bonds between the sugars by the transgycosidase enzymes and the formation of the peptide cross-links by the transpeptidase enzymes. This results in a weak cell wall and osmotic lysis of the bacterium.The fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, etc.) work by inhibiting one or more of a group of enzymes called topoisomerase, enzymes needed for supercoiling, replication and separation of circular bacterial DNA.For example, DNA gyrase is a topoisomerase that catalyzes the negative supercoiling of the circular DNA found in bacteria. Topoisomerase IV, on the other hand, is involved in the relaxation of the supercoiled circular DNA, enabling the separation of the interlinked daughter chromosomes at the end of bacterial DNA replication.In gram-positive bacteria, the main target for fluoroquinolones is DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), an enzyme responsible for supercoiling of bacterial DNA during DNA replication; in gram-negative bacteria, the primary target is topoisomerase IV, an enzyme responsible for relaxation of supercoiled circular DNA and separation of the inter-linked daughter chromosomes.The tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, demeclocycline, minocycline, etc.) block bacterial translation by binding reversibly to the 30S subunit and distoing it in such a way that the anticodons of the charged tRNAs cannot align properly with the codons of the mRNA.The aminoglycosides (streptomycin, neomycin, netilmicin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin, etc.) bind irreversibly to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.","cop":4,"opa":"Gentamycin","opb":"Ciprofloxacin","opc":"Tetracycline","opd":"Vancomycin","subject_name":"Pharmacology","topic_name":null,"id":"643e9f4a-030c-45b2-867a-2393445afea3","choice_type":"multi"}

{"question":"Phosphate bonded investment should be completely carbon free, otherwise:","exp":"Carbon is often added to the powder to produce clean castings and facilitate the divesting of the casting from the investment mold. This addition is appropriate when the casting alloy is gold, but there is disagreement regarding the effects of carbon in phosphate investments used for casting silver-palladium alloys, palladium-silver alloys, or base metal alloys. It is believed that carbon can embrittle the alloys, even though the investment is heated to temperatures that burn out the carbon. Some evidence indicates that palladium reacts with carbon at temperatures above 1504 \u00b0C. Thus, if the casting temperature of an alloy with high palladium content exceeds this critical point, a phosphate investment without carbon should be used.\nRef: Phillip\u2019s 12th edition page 208","cop":3,"opa":"Investment chips off when molten metal enters the mold space","opb":"Black castings","opc":"Carbon makes the casting brittle","opd":"Smooth casting","subject_name":"Dental","topic_name":null,"id":"06bece2b-7071-448b-8681-a396bcf4c0f5","choice_type":"single"}

{"question":"In which of the following conditions would maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values be the highest:","exp":"Friends, many questions are asked on serum alpha fetoprotein, therefore basic knowledge of this protein is quite vital.\nAlpha Fetoprotein:\n\nIt is a glycoprotein\u00a0synthesized by the fetal yolk sac\u00a0in the early weeks of gestation and by the gastrointestinal tract\u00a0and liver\u00a0later.\nIt is the most abundant protein in the fetal serum.\nIt circulates in fetal serum and passes into fetal urine and amniotic fluid.\nConcentration of AFP increases steadily in fetal serum till 13 weeks, (3 mg\/ml) after which the level rapidly decreases throughout the rest of pregnancy.\nAFP level in fetal serum declines following birth and by one year of age, its concentration is 1 ng\/ml which persists throughout life.\nAFP passes from the fetus to amniotic fluid when fetus passes urine.\nIt passes into the maternal serum by diffusion across the placental membranes and via placental circulation and is found in steadily increasing quantities in maternal serum after 12 weeks.\n\nThese are the usual ways of entry of serum alfa fetoprotein in maternal serum but serum alfa fetoprotein can find its way in maternal serum in other ways too.\n\nOpen fetal body wall defects uncoverd by integument permit allows additional AFP to leak into the amniotic fluid and thus maternal serum AFP are increased. This is the reason for increase in serum alpha fetoprotein in neural tube defects and ventral wall defects.\nMaternal screening is done between 15-20 weeks (according to Williams 23\/e, p 289, Fernando Arias 3\/e, p 58).\nIt is measured in nanograms per ml and reported as a multiple of the median (MOM).\nMSAFP of 2.5 MOM is considered as the upper limit of normal (for twin pregnancy it is 3.5 MOM).\n\nNow after having this basic knowledge lets have a look at the question.\nIn the question alpha fetoprotein will be increased in the following conditions.\n\nGastroschisis \u2013 Ventral wall defect\nOmphalocele \u2013 Ventral wall defect\nSpina bifida occulta \u2013 Neural tube defect\n\nIn Down\u2019s syndrome - AFP levels are decreased.\nSpina bifida occulta:\nSpina bifida occulta is usually a small, clinically asymptomatic defect, covered by skin, so there are less chances of mixing of fetal serum and maternal serum. Therefore the maternal serum alphafetoprotein level usually does not increase in spina bifida occulta.\n\u201cIn the fetus with a defect such as anencephaly or spina bifida, AFP enters the amniotic fluid in increased amounts, leading to higher levels in the maternal serum as well. Levels of AFP are elevated in amniotic fluid and maternal serum only when such lesions are \u201copen,\u201d i.e., when the neural tissue is exposed or covered by only a thin membrane. When NTDs are skin-covered, AFP does not escape from the fetal circulation, and such defects are generally not detected by maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) screening\u201d.\nUSG in Obs. and Gyane by Callen 4\/e, p 25\nOmphalocele:\u00a0\nFernando Arias 3\/e, p 84\nIt is a midline defect of the anterior abdominal wall characterized by herniation of the abdominal viscera into the base of the umbilical cord.\nThe protruding organs are typically covered by a thin aminoperitoneal membrane. Omphalocele has a strong association with high levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein because the ventral wall defect allows mixing of fetal and maternal circulation.\nGastroschisis:\nFernando Arias 2\/e, p 83\nGastroschisis is a paraumbilical defect of the anterior abdominal wall, through which abdominal viscera herniates. The defect is usually located on the right side of the cord insertion and compromises the full thickness of the abdominal wall. There is no sac or membrane covering the herniated organs. This defect is associated with high alpha feto protein titre.\nBoth gastroschisis and omphalocele are ventral wall defects containing abdominal organs and both are associated with high alphafetoprotein level in maternal serum.\nBut it is likely that alphafetoprotein level will be higher in patients with gastroschisis as there is no sac or membrane which covers the herniated organs in this defect. So there is more possibility of fetoprotein leak into the maternal serum or amniotic fluid in Gastroschisis.

{"question":"A person presented to OPD with complaints of rotatory veigo and nausea in the morning on change in position of the head. WHat is your diagnosis?","exp":"Positional veigo\/ BPPV: It is characterized by veigo when the head is placed in a ceain critical position. There is no hearing loss or other neurologic symptoms. Positional testing establishes the diagnosis and helps to differentiate it from positional veigo of central origin. Disease caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection. It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals and calcium carbonate, is released from the degeneration macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in a critical head position, it causes displacement of the cupula and veigo. The veigo is fatigable on assuming the same position repeatedly due to dispersal of the otoconia but can be induced again after a period of rest. Thus, typical history and Hallpike maneuver establishes the diagnosis. The condition can be treated by performing Epley's maneuver. The principle of this maneuver is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The doctor stands behind the patient and the assistant on the side. The patient is made to sit on the table so that when he is made to lie down, his head is beyond the edge of the table as is done in Dix-Hallpike maneuver. His face is turned 450 to the affected side. The maneuver consists of five positions * Position 1. With the head turned 450, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix-Hallpike). It will cause veigo and nystagmus. Wait till veigo and nystagmus subside. * Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 900 rotation. * Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 900 -rotation face-down position. * Position 4. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 450. * Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 200. There should be a pause at each position till there is no nystagmus or there is slowing of nystagmus, before changing to the next position. After maneuver is complete, patient should maintain an upright posture for 48 h. Eighty percent of the patients will be cured by a single maneuver. If the patients remain symptomatic, the maneuver can be repeated. A bone vibrator placed on the mastoid bone helps to loosen the debris. - Meniere's disease: Has an episodic veigo and it lasts for >20 minutes. - Vestibular neuronitis: Veigo lasts for many days. - Labyrinthitis: There is a history of fever and trauma, and the veigo lasts for days.","cop":2,"opa":"Labyrinthitis","opb":"BPPV","opc":"Vestibular neuronitis","opd":"Meniere's disease","subject_name":"ENT","topic_name":"AIIMS 2018","id":"8616b528-3a38-4bc5-b002-2e5133f56496","choice_type":"single"}

Psoas abscesses may arise from a hematogenous source, by contiguous spread from an intra- abdominal or pelvic process, or by contiguous spread from nearby bony structures (e.g., veebral bodies). Associated osteomyelitis due to spread from bone to muscle or from muscle to bone is common in psoas abscesses. When pott's disease was common, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was a frequent cause of psoas abscess. Currently, either S. aureus or a mixture of enteric organisms including aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli is usually isolated from psoas abscesses in the United States. S. aureus is most likely to be isolated when a psoas abscess arises from hematogenous spread or a contiguous focus of osteomyelitis; a mixed enteric flora is the most likely etiology when the abscess has an intra- abdominal or pelvic source. Patients with psoas abscesses frequently present with fever, lower abdominal or back pain, or pain referred to the hip or knee. CT is the most useful diagnostic technique.\"- Harrison 19\/e p852 \"Spinal TB (Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis) often involves two or more adjacent veebral bodies. Whereas the upper thoracic spine is the most common site of spinal TB in children, the lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are usually affected in adults.

With advanced disease, collapse of veebral bodies results in kyphosis (gibbus). A paraveebral \"cold\" abscess may also form.

{"question":"Chronic mercury toxicity results from:","exp":"All the options given in the question lead to mercury toxicity.\nMethyl mercury is the most common form that is transformed by natural processes; it is a more toxic form than ethyl mercury (C2H5Hg+) or elemental mercury. Methyl mercury is a major safety concern because it bioaccumulates through the food chain; its pharmacokinetic half-life is longer (1.5 to 3 months) than that of ethyl mercury (less than 1 week). In air, the concentrations of mercury range from about 0.01 to 0.02 \u00b5g\/m3.\nMercury accumulates in the kidneys. In the brain, metallic mercury can be converted to an inorganic form that is retained in the brain. Elemental mercury and mercury vapor have a half-life of 1 to 3 months. Mercury leaves the body by excretion through urine and feces.\nExposure to high levels of mercury can injure the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Chronic mercury toxicity may be manifested as tremors; memory loss; and changes in personality, vision, and hearing.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 124","cop":4,"opa":"Inhalation while removing old amalgam","opb":"Skin contact","opc":"Mercury vapour","opd":"All of the above","subject_name":"Dental","topic_name":null,"id":"7f1066f0-b7c7-4a61-96df-d0873dd2e03e","choice_type":"multi"}

Rheumatic fever (RF) is an acute, immunologically mediated, multisystem inflammatory disease classically occurring a few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis; occasionally, RF can follow streptococcal infections at other sites, such as the skin. Acute rheumatic carditis is a common manifestation of active RF and may progress over time to chronic rheumatic hea disease (RHD), mainly manifesting as valvular abnormalities. RHD is characterized principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, paicularly involving the mitral valve; indeed, RHD is viually the only cause of mitral stenosis Type of necrosis seen in RHD - Fibrinoid necrosis. Morphology: Distinctive lesions occur in the hea, called Aschoff bodies, consisting of foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cell (pathognomonic fo RF).These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei (occasionally binucleate) in which the chromatin condenses into a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation \"caterpillar cells\").","cop":4,"opa":"Sarcoidosis","opb":"Fungal granuloma","opc":"Tuberculosis","opd":"Rheumatic hea disease","subject_name":"Pathology","topic_name":"AIIMS 2017","id":"f7c04393-b875-4566-9342-0dba89656d27","choice_type":"single"}

Once transferrin is saturated with iron, any that has accumulated in the mucosal cells is lost when the cells are shed. Expression of the ferropoin gene is downregulated by hepcidin, a peptide secreted by the liver when body iron reserves are adequate. In response to hypoxia, anemia, or hemorrhage, the synthesis of hepcidin is reduced, leading to increased synthesis of ferropoin and increased iron absorption. As a result of this mucosal barrier, only ~10% of dietary iron is absorbed, and only 1 to 5% from many plant foods.","cop":2,"opa":"Hephaestin","opb":"Ferropoin","opc":"Divalent metal ion transpoer","opd":"Transferrin","subject_name":"Biochemistry","topic_name":null,"id":"8b0d7f3b-3c6c-4973-83d1-9e3220b73538","choice_type":"single"}

Chemical fixatives can be considered as members of three major categories: coagulant, cross-linking, and compound.

Cellular architecture in vivo is maintained primarily by lipoproteins and fibrous proteins such as collagen. Coagulating these proteins maintains tissue histomorphology at the light microscope level. Unfounately, because coagulant fixatives result in cytoplasmic flocculation and poor preservation of mitochondria and secretory granules, these fixatives are not useful in ultrastructural analysis. Examples: Ethanol, methanol, acetone, picric acid and trichloroacetic acid Cross-linking fixatives: Several chemicals were selected as fixatives secondary to their potential actions of forming cross-links both within and between proteins and nucleic acids. Examples include formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and other aldehydes, e.g. chloral hydrate and glyoxal, as well as metal salts, e.g. mercuric and zinc chloride, and other metallic compounds, e.g. osmium tetroxide. useful for electron microscopic examination - Glutraldehyde (best one)\/formaldehyde\/osmium tetraoxide Compound fixatives: Alcoholic formalin","cop":3,"opa":"Osmium tetroxide","opb":"Glutaraldehyde","opc":"Methanol","opd":"Formaldehyde","subject_name":"Pathology","topic_name":"AIIMS 2020","id":"139d03ab-9bd0-4bb7-a076-8b3b2ff2528e","choice_type":"single"}

The aim is to increase parents' confidence in understanding their baby.\nAn infant's reaction are state related. So it is extremely important that observations of state be considered as a starting point from which all other observations are made.\nThe ideal time to administer the examination is when the infant is asleep and midway between feeding cycles.\n\nScores \nSleep states\n\nState 1 : Sleep with regular breathing, eyes closed, no spontaneous activity except startles or jerky movements at quite regular intervals.\n\na State 2 : Sleep with eyes closed; rapid eye movements can often be observed under closed lids; low activity level with random movements and startles.\nAwake states\n\nState 3 : Drowsy or semidrowsy; eyes may be open but dull and heavy lidded, or closed, eyelids fluttering; activity level minimal, Movements are usually smooth, although there may be startles. Some infants may also show fuss\/cry vocalizations in this state. What distinguishes state 3 from state 5 when both are accompanied by fuss\/cry vocalizations is the minimal movement in state 3 and considerable movement in state 5.\nState 4 : Alert, eyes open with bright look. Motor activity is minimal; there can be a glazed look that is easily changed into a brighter look with appropriate stimulation.\n\n\nState 5 : Eyes likely to be open; considerable motor activity, with thrusting movements of the extremities, and even a few spontaneous startles; reactive to external stimulation with increase in startles or motor activity.\n\n\nState 6 : Crying : characterized by intense, loud, rhythmic, and sustained cry vocalizations that are difficult to break through with stimulation; motor activity is high.\n\nComing to the question\n\nAccording to above staging, the newborn in our question comes under state 6 (crying lustily, and moving all 4 limbs).\nIf you have any confusion, read the following facts on crying (state 6) :-\n\n\"it is important to distinguish between crying as a state (stage 6) from the fuss\/ay vocalization that can occur in state 5 and even state 3. Some infants show repeated episodes of fuss \/cry vocalization in state 5 but may not reach state 6. This may also be a maturational issue, because some preterm infants may not have energy reserves to sustain state 6. In general, state 6 Can be distinguished from state 5 by the intensity and sustained quality of the crying (at least 15 seconds) and unavailability of infant in state 6. Repeated brief episodes of cry \/fuss in state 5 do not mean that the infant has moved into state 6.

He realized the potential of releasing the brake and thereby unleashing our immune cells to attack tumors.Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints are negative regulators of T-cell immune function. Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers.For several types of cancer, including lung cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma and melanoma checkpoint therapy against PD-1 has proven more effective and positive results found.But recent clinical studies indicate that for melanoma the combination therapy of both CTLA-4 and PD-1 is more effective.Thus, Allison and Honjo combine different strategies to release the brakes on the immune system with the aim of eliminating tumor cells even more efficiently.Their paper formed the basis of current cancer immunotherapy.But the original concept of cancer immunotherapy was discovered by William Bradley Coley (1872).","cop":3,"opa":"Apoptotic pathway","opb":"Crispr-Cas9","opc":"Negative immune regulation","opd":"Molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythm","subject_name":"Medicine","topic_name":null,"id":"9ba605e2-bf6d-427b-a4ed-c8948569ac22","choice_type":"single"}

{"question":"What is the cause of delirium tremens in alcoholics?","exp":"Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome and Delirium Tremens Alcohol withdrawal syndrome typically occurs within 1-2 days of alcohol abstinence and is characterized by autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, transient hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and tonic-clonic seizures. Symptoms may be mild for many patients, but if left untreated, it can lead to delirium tremens, an uncommon but severe and life-threatening manifestation of withdrawal marked by severe hallucinations, disorientation, and autonomic overactivity. Symptoms and signs include the following: Profoundly delirious state associated with tremulousness and agitation. Excessive motor activity (most notable as a tremor that affects the face, tongue, and extremities but that may also involve speech) and purposeless activity such as picking at the bedclothes. Hallucinations, classically visual rather than auditory, are a prominent feature. Autonomic nervous system hyperactivity: tachycardia, dilated pupils, fever, and hyperhidrosis. Loss of orientation as to time and place. Such patients are often oblivious to the most obvious features of the surrounding environment. Treatment Note temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and record results twice hourly to monitor for hyperpyrexia and hypotension. Consider lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis if fever or meningismus is present. 1. FLUIDS Fluid requirements on the first day of treatment may be as if profound dehydration is present. Intravenous fluid should contain glucose to prevent hypoglycemia. 2. THIAMINE Thiamine, 100 mg\/d, prevents Wernicke encephalopathy. 3.

The imperative here is to come up with an acceptable compromise for the dentition, one that will mask the underlying skeletal deformity as much as possible. This can be achieved using Steiner\u2019s sticks, which allow calculations to be carried out for a particular ANB value.\nIn addition to commonly used sagittal discrepancy indicators, that is angle ANB, sagittal maxilla mandibular relationship should be reconfirmed with other variables which include WITS appraisal, A\u2013B plane angle and beta angle.\u00a0\nKey Concept:\nTweed\u2019s analysis (originally undertaken in 1954) is primarily based on inclination of the mandibular incisors to the basal bone and the latter\u2019s association with the vertical relation of the mandible to the cranium.
