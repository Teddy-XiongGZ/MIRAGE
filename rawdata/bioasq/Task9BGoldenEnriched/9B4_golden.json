          "text": "Elementary flux modes (EFMs) analysis constitutes a fundamental tool in systems biology. However, the efficient calculation of EFMs in genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) is still a challenge. We present a novel algorithm that uses a linear programming-based tree search and efficiently enumerates a subset of EFMs in GSMNs.RESULTS: Our approach is compared with the EFMEvolver approach, demonstrating a significant improvement in computation time. We also validate the usefulness of our new approach by studying the acetate overflow metabolism in the Escherichia coli bacteria. To do so, we computed 1 million EFMs for each energetic amino acid and then analysed the relevance of each energetic amino acid based on gene/protein expression data and the obtained EFMs. We found good agreement between previous experiments and the conclusions reached using EFMs. Finally, we also analysed the performance of our approach when applied to large GSMNs.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The stand-alone software TreeEFM is implemented in C++ and interacts with the open-source linear solver COIN-OR Linear program Solver (CLP).",

Among them, those based on solving linear programming (LP) problems are known to be very efficient if the main interest lies in computing large enough sets of EFMs.RESULTS: Here, we propose a new method called EFM-Ta that boosts the efficiency rate by analyzing the information provided by the LP solver. We base our method on a further study of the final tableau of the simplex method. By performing additional elementary steps and avoiding trivial solutions consisting of two cycles, we obtain many more EFMs for each LP problem posed, improving the efficiency rate of previously proposed methods by more than one order of magnitude.",

TransCon CNP is in clinical development for the treatment of comorbidities associated with achondroplasia. In both mice and cynomolgus monkeys, sustained exposure to CNP via TransCon CNP was more efficacious in stimulating bone growth than intermittent CNP exposure. TransCon CNP was well tolerated with no adverse cardiovascular effects observed at exposure levels exceeding the expected clinical therapeutic exposure. At equivalent dose levels, reductions in blood pressure and/or an increase in heart rate were seen following single subcutaneous injections of the unconjugated CNP-38 molecule or a daily CNP-39 molecule (same amino acid sequence as Vosoritide, USAN:INN).

Novel transcript discovery enabled by joint analysis of large collections of RNA-seq data sets has emerged as one such analysis. Current methods for transcript discovery rely on a \u00272-Step\u0027 approach where the first step encompasses building transcripts from individual data sets, followed by the second step that merges predicted transcripts across data sets. To increase the power of transcript discovery from large collections of RNA-seq data sets, we developed a novel \u00271-Step\u0027 approach named Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models (PRAM) that builds transcript models from pooled RNA-seq data sets. We demonstrate in a computational benchmark that 1-Step outperforms 2-Step approaches in predicting overall transcript structures and individual splice junctions, while performing competitively in detecting exonic nucleotides. Applying PRAM to 30 human ENCODE RNA-seq data sets identified unannotated transcripts with epigenetic and RAMPAGE signatures similar to those of recently annotated transcripts. In a case study, we discovered and experimentally validated new transcripts through the application of PRAM to mouse hematopoietic RNA-seq data sets. We uncovered new transcripts that share a differential expression pattern with a neighboring gene Pik3cg implicated in human hematopoietic phenotypes, and we provided evidence for the conservation of this relationship in human.

The TF BACH2 is essential for T and B lymphocytes and is associated with an archetypal super-enhancer (SE). Single-nucleotide variants in the BACH2 locus are associated with several autoimmune diseases, but BACH2 mutations that cause Mendelian monogenic primary immunodeficiency have not previously been identified. Here we describe a syndrome of BACH2-related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (BRIDA) that results from BACH2 haploinsufficiency. Affected subjects had lymphocyte-maturation defects that caused immunoglobulin deficiency and intestinal inflammation. The mutations disrupted protein stability by interfering with homodimerization or by causing aggregation. We observed analogous lymphocyte defects in Bach2-heterozygous mice. More generally, we observed that genes that cause monogenic haploinsufficient diseases were substantially enriched for TFs and SE architecture. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized feature of SE architecture in Mendelian diseases of immunity: heterozygous mutations in SE-regulated genes identified by whole-exome/genome sequencing may have greater significance than previously recognized.",

Secondary functional outcome measures for favorable six-month recovery i.e. a mRS of 0 to 3 (OR: 3.45; 95% CI 0.79-15.01) were comparable for both groups. Similarly, there was no difference in MOCA neurocognitive performance (p-value: 0.75) and in the incidence of DCI (OR: 0.85 95% CI: 0.28-2.59).CONCLUSIONS: Use of Cerebrolysin in addition to standard-of-care management of aneurysmal SAH is safe, well tolerated and feasible.

It is applicable to experiments with multiple conditions, multiple biological replicate runs and multiple technical replicate runs, and unbalanced designs. It is based on a flexible family of linear mixed-effects models that handle complex patterns of technical artifacts and missing values. The approach is implemented in MSstatsTMT, a freely available open-source R/Bioconductor package compatible with data processing tools such as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, OpenMS, and SpectroMine. Evaluation on a controlled mixture, simulated datasets, and three biological investigations with diverse designs demonstrated that MSstatsTMT balanced the sensitivity and the specificity of detecting differentially abundant proteins, in large-scale experiments with multiple biological mixtures.",

The identification of cancers with a significant adenosine drive is critical to understand the potential for these molecules. However, it is challenging to measure tumor adenosine levels at scale, thus novel, clinically tractable biomarkers are needed.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a gene expression signature for the adenosine signaling using regulatory networks derived from the literature and validated this in patients. We applied the signature to large cohorts of disease from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients.RESULTS: The signature captures baseline adenosine levels in vivo (r 2 \u003d 0.92, P \u003d 0.018), is reduced after small-molecule inhibition of A2AR in mice (r 2 \u003d -0.62, P \u003d 0.001) and humans (reduction in 5 of 7 patients, 70%), and is abrogated after A2AR knockout. Analysis of TCGA confirms a negative association between adenosine and overall survival (OS, HR \u003d 0.6, P \u003c 2.2e-16) as well as progression-free survival (PFS, HR \u003d 0.77, P \u003d 0.0000006). Further, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced OS (HR \u003d 0.47, P \u003c 2.2e-16) and PFS (HR \u003d 0.65, P \u003d 0.0000002) in CD8+ T-cell-infiltrated tumors. Mutation of TGFβ superfamily members is associated with enhanced adenosine signaling and worse OS (HR \u003d 0.43, P \u003c 2.2e-16). Finally, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in published cohorts (HR \u003d 0.29, P \u003d 0.00012).CONCLUSIONS: These data support the adenosine pathway as a mediator of a successful antitumor immune response, demonstrate the prognostic potential of the signature for immunotherapy, and inform patient selection strategies for adenosine pathway modulators currently in development.",

Here, we perform whole-exome-sequencing and genome-wide genotyping in 145 patients (median age-at-diagnosis of 3.5 years), in whom no Mendelian disorders were clinically suspected. In five patients we detect a primary immunodeficiency or enteropathy, with clinical consequences (XIAP, CYBA, SH2D1A, PCSK1). We also present a case study of a VEO-IBD patient with a mosaic de novo, pathogenic allele in CYBB. The mutation is present in ~70% of phagocytes and sufficient to result in defective bacterial handling but not life-threatening infections. Finally, we show that VEO-IBD patients have, on average, higher IBD polygenic risk scores than population controls (99 patients and 18,780 controls; P \u003c 4 × 10-10), and replicate this finding in an independent cohort of VEO-IBD cases and controls (117 patients and 2,603 controls; P \u003c 5 × 10-10).

        "During developmental transition, the zygotic genome is largely transcriptionally quiescent and undergoes significant chromatin remodeling. In Drosophila, the DNA-binding protein Zelda (also known as Vielfaltig) is required for this transition and for transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. Zelda is differentially required for chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and gene expression in the early Drosophila embryo. Zelda overcomes the high intrinsic nucleosome barrier at enhancers during Drosophila zygotic genome activation. Early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier. Zelda tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of zelda(zld) motifs.",

Due to the complexity of the amino acid (AA) alphabet, rich post-translational modification, and diverse subcellular localization of proteins, few versatile tools are available for effective identification and visualization of protein motifs. In addition, various reduced AA alphabets based on physicochemical, structural, or functional properties have been valuable in the study of protein alignment, folding, structure prediction, and evolution. However, there is lack of tools for applying reduced AA alphabets to the identification and visualization of statistically significant motifs. To fill this gap, we developed an R/Bioconductor package dagLogo, which has several advantages over existing tools. First, dagLogo allows various formats for input sets and provides comprehensive options to build optimal background models. It implements different reduced AA alphabets to group AAs of similar properties.

With lipidomics datasets becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets. lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names. Through integration with the Metabolomics Workbench API, users can search, download, and reanalyze public lipidomics datasets seamlessly. lipidr allows thorough data inspection, normalization, and uni- and multivariate analyses, displaying results as interactive visualizations. To enable interpretation of lipid class, chain length, and total unsaturation data, we also developed and implemented a novel lipid set enrichment analysis. A companion online guide with two live example datasets is presented at https://www.lipidr.org/. We expect that the ease of use and innovative features of lipidr will allow the lipidomics research community to gain novel detailed insights from lipidomics data.",
