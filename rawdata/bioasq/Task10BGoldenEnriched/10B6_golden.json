        "Mycros are the first inhibitors of c-Myc/Max dimerization, which have been demonstrated to inhibit DNA binding of c-Myc with preference over other dimeric transcription factors in vitroMost Myc inhibitors prevent the association between Myc and its obligate heterodimerization partner Max via their respective bHLH-ZIP domainsPreviously we showed that two c-Myc-Max inhibitors, 10058-F4 and 10074-G5, bound to distinct ID regions of the monomeric c-Myc bHLHZip domainWe tested the efficacy of Mycro3, a small-molecule inhibitor of Myc-Max dimerizationIn a fluorescence polarization screen for the MYC-MAX interaction, we have identified a novel small-molecule inhibitor of MYC, KJ-Pyr-9, from a Kröhnke pyridine libraryWe have previously demonstrated that the small molecule 10058-F4, known to bind to the c-MYC bHLHZip dimerization domain and inhibiting the c-MYC/MAX interaction, also interferes with the MYCN/MAX dimerization in vitro and imparts anti-tumorigenic effects in neuroblastoma tumor models with MYCN overexpressionWe developed a series of small-molecule MYC inhibitors that engage MYC inside cells, disrupt MYC/MAX dimers, and impair MYC-driven gene expression.Inhibition of MYC/MAX dimerization by a small-molecule antagonist (IIA6B17) has been shown to interfere with MYC-induced transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts, suggesting that the functional inhibitors of the MYC family of oncoproteins have potential as therapeutic agents."

For instance, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause several types of neurological manifestations, such as subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, ataxia, peripheral polyneuropathy, optic nerve neuropathy, and cognitive disorders. In addition, vitamin B1 (Thiamine) and B6 (Pyridoxine) deficiency can both cause peripheral neuropathy. Specifically, vitamin B1 deficiency can also cause confusion, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and ataxia in the context of beriberi and Wernicke\u0027s encephalopathy.

Emerging aspects of the Covid-19 clinical presentation are its long-term effects, which are characteristic of the so-called \"long COVID\". The main symptoms associated with \"long COVID\" were headache, fatigue, muscle aches/myalgia, articular pains, cognitive impairment, loss of concentration, and loss of smell. Additionally, the subjects showed significant levels of insomnia (p \u003c 0.05) and an overall reduced quality of life (p \u003c 0.05). Long COVID is a complex condition with prolonged heterogeneous symptoms. The nature of studies precludes a precise case definition or risk evaluation.
