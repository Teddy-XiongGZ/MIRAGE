        "Early data suggest that COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant is less severe than infection caused by prior variants. Some studies have shown a reduced risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and in-hospital mortality. The relative mildness of disease reported in these studies may reflect the younger age of individuals impacted at this stage of the surge or a higher proportion of reinfections.",

Studies have shown that Omicron is associated with milder symptoms and a lower risk of hospitalization compared to previous variants such as Delta. However, it is important to note that not all infected individuals experience a mild Omicron infection, and the severity of the illness can still vary depending on factors such as age and comorbidities.",
        "COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant appears to be less severe than infections caused by previous variants. Studies have reported milder symptoms and reduced hospitalization rates associated with Omicron infections. For instance, one study found a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization compared to the Delta variant. Another study comparing first-time SARS-CoV-2 infections during the emergence of Omicron and Delta variants found significantly less severe outcomes for Omicron cases. After adjusting for various factors, the 3-day risks of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation were consistently lower in the Omicron cohort compared to the Delta cohort. Furthermore, a large national cohort study assessing relative risks of hospital attendance, admission, or death showed that the risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for Omicron than for Delta. However, it is important to note that not all individuals infected with Omicron experience mild illness."

Viltolarsen restores the reading frame of the DMD gene by skipping exon 53 and produces a truncated but functional form of dystrophin. Therefore, viltolarsen can be used for DMD patients who have genetic mutations that disrupt the reading frame of the DMD gene due to exon 53 deletion. This therapy has been shown to improve muscle function in clinical trials and has been approved by regulatory agencies in several countries. It is important to note that viltolarsen is not effective for all types of DMD, as it only targets specific genetic mutations. Therefore, genetic testing is necessary to determine if a patient is eligible for this treatment.",
        "Viltolarsen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (PMO) designed for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) caused by specific mutations in the DMD gene. It works by skipping exon 53 of the DMD gene, which restores the reading frame and results in the production of a truncated but functional form of dystrophin protein. This approach is particularly beneficial for patients with DMD who have genetic mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping, as it can potentially slow down disease progression and improve muscle function. Therefore, viltolarsen can be used for treating DMD cases that are responsive to exon 53 skipping therapy."

Stopping them may worsen asthma or COPD control and thereby increase the risk for complications of COVID-19.",

In fact, evidence from clinical studies suggests that ICS may have a protective role in preventing severe COVID-19 and could be a promising treatment for the disease.

This drug works by inducing exon skipping, which allows for the production of partially functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is a protein that helps to maintain muscle integrity, and its absence or dysfunction leads to the progressive muscle degeneration seen in DMD. Eteplirsen has been shown to increase dystrophin levels in some patients with DMD, leading to improved muscle function and slower disease progression. However, it is important to note that eteplirsen is only effective in patients with specific genetic mutations, and it is not a cure for DMD. Other treatments may be necessary to manage symptoms and improve quality of life for individuals with this condition.",

This approval marks an important milestone in the treatment of DMD, as it provides a new therapeutic option for patients with this devastating disease.

Exon skipping is a therapeutic approach that aims to restore the reading frame of the mutated DMD gene, allowing for the production of partially functional dystrophin protein and potentially slowing down disease progression.

        "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects boys and is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration. The loss of independent ambulation is a hallmark feature of DMD, typically occurring between the ages of 7-13 years. This loss of ambulation is due to the gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles in the legs, which eventually leads to difficulty standing and walking. While there are currently no known cures for DMD, there are treatments available that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for those affected by this condition. These treatments include physical therapy, medications, and assistive devices such as braces or wheelchairs. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing DMD, as they can help delay the onset of symptoms and improve outcomes for patients.",
        "In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked recessive genetic disorder, the loss of independent ambulation typically occurs between the ages of 7 and 13 years. This progressive muscle degeneration is characterized by a decline in muscle strength and function, eventually leading to the inability to walk independently. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which results in the absence or dysfunction of the dystrophin protein, essential for maintaining muscle integrity and function. The loss of ambulation significantly impacts the quality of life for individuals with DMD and often necessitates the use of assistive devices such as wheelchairs for mobility (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34924398)."

        "The process that generates multiple transcripts from the same gene is called alternative splicing (AS). AS is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that allows for the production of different mRNA isoforms from a single gene. This process can increase proteome diversity and regulate mRNA levels, which is important for expanding proteomic complexity and functional diversity in higher eukaryotes. In plants, AS may also serve as a buffer against stress-responsive transcriptomes to reduce the metabolic cost of translating all AS transcripts. While the contribution of AS to proteome complexity remains elusive in plants, it is clear that this process plays an important role in regulating gene expression and generating protein isoforms with distinct functions."

The disease presents as a progressive fatal neurologic syndrome, which is not easily distinguished from other feline neurologic conditions. FSE is characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrPsc) in the central nervous system. While most cases have been reported in England, a few instances have also been documented in other European countries."

        "Xist is a gene that encodes a long noncoding RNA molecule, which plays a central role in inducing X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals. The Xist RNA has two major splicing variants: long and short isoforms. It is expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome and required for the silencing of most genes on that chromosome. The specific localization of Xist transcripts to the inactive X is important for silencing, but it is not known how these transcripts localize to the inactive X chromosome. Silencing on the inactive X chromosome coincides with the acquisition of chromatin modifications, resulting in the formation of extraordinarily stable facultative heterochromatin that is faithfully propagated through subsequent cell divisions. The integration of all these processes requires a region of the X chromosome known as the X-inactivation center, which contains the Xist gene and its cis-regulatory elements."

        "Hydroxyl radical is generated by Fenton reaction of Fe (II) with the ROS, H2O2, which, in turn, is formed by the dismutation of the ROS, superoxide."
