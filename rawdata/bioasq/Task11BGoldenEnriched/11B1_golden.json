        "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes for the protein dystrophin. The most common mutation types in DMD are large deletions, accounting for approximately 60-70% of cases. These deletions often disrupt the reading frame of the gene, leading to a nonfunctional or truncated dystrophin protein. Another frequent mutation type is duplications, which represent around 5-10% of cases and can also disrupt the reading frame. Small mutations, such as point mutations and small insertions or deletions, account for about 20-30% of DMD cases and can lead to premature stop codons or altered amino acids that impair protein function. Among these small mutations, nonsense mutations are particularly common and cause a premature termination of translation. Overall, these various mutation types result in reduced or absent dystrophin expression, compromising muscle fiber integrity and leading to progressive muscle weakness and degeneration characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
        "The most common mutation types in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are deletions, duplications, and point mutations. DMD is caused by mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene, with approximately 65% of cases resulting from deletions, 7% from duplications, and 26% from point mutations. In one study, it was found that among identified mutations, 64% were deletions, 18% were duplications, and 18% were point mutations. Another study reported that out of all detected mutations, 70.5% were exonic deletions, 11.1% were exonic duplications, and 18.2% were small mutations (mostly nonsense/frameshift types). Additionally, a gene deletion rate of 54.3% and a gene duplication rate of 10.6% have been observed in some patient cohorts. Deletion mutants frequently occur in Exon 45-54 (71.9%), while gene duplications often occur in Exon 1-40 (82.9%). Overall, the majority of DMD cases are caused by deletions in the dystrophin gene followed by point mutations and duplications as less frequent causes.\n"

The approval was granted under the Accelerated Approval Program based on an observed increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle in patients treated with casimersen. This drug is designed to skip exon 45 during pre-mRNA splicing, allowing for the production of a truncated but functional form of dystrophin protein. Clinical trials have shown that casimersen can increase dystrophin levels in patients with DMD, which may lead to improved muscle function and delayed disease progression. However, further studies are needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment.",
        "Casimersen is an antisense oligonucleotide drug designed to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with specific genetic mutations. It works by promoting exon 45 skipping during the pre-mRNA splicing process, which allows for the production of a partially functional dystrophin protein, essential for muscle function. The effectiveness of casimersen was demonstrated in a phase 3 clinical trial called ESSENCE (NCT02500381), which evaluated its safety and efficacy in DMD patients amenable to exon 45 skipping. In February 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to casimersen (brand name Amondys 45) based on an increase in dystrophin production observed in skeletal muscle biopsies from treated patients. While this surrogate endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, confirmatory trials are needed to verify the drug\u0027s impact on motor function and other clinically meaningful outcomes. Overall, casimersen has shown promise as a treatment option for DMD patients with specific genetic mutations; however, further research is required to establish its long-term benefits and safety profile.",

The approval, granted on February 25, 2021, under the US FDA Accelerated Approval Program, was based on an observed increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle in patients treated with casimersen. This increase in dystrophin levels suggests that casimersen may be effective for treating DMD; however, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety profile."

        "Eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 51 skipping. DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Eteplirsen works by promoting the skipping of exon 51 during mRNA processing, allowing for the production of a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein.\n\nThe approval of eteplirsen was based on a small clinical trial that demonstrated an increase in dystrophin levels in treated patients. However, its clinical efficacy has been a subject of debate due to limited data on long-term functional outcomes. Some studies have reported modest improvements or stabilization in motor function, while others have not observed significant benefits. The FDA has required further clinical trials to confirm eteplirsen\u0027s effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, eteplirsen is approved for treating DMD patients with specific genetic mutations, but its overall effectiveness remains controversial. While it has shown potential in increasing dystrophin levels, more robust evidence from larger clinical trials is needed to conclusively establish its impact on long-term functional outcomes and quality of life for DMD patients.",

Additionally, at Year 4, a significantly greater proportion of eteplirsen-treated patients were still ambulant versus controls (10/12 vs 3/11; p \u003d 0.020).

        "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal progressive pediatric muscle disorder and genetically inherited as an X-linked disease that caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. DMD leads to progressive muscle weakness, degeneration, and wasting; finally, follows with the premature demise in affected individuals due to respiratory and/or cardiac failure typically by age of 30. For decades, scientists tried massively to find an effective therapy method, but there is no absolute cure currently for patients with DMD, nevertheless, recent advanced progressions on the treatment of DMD will be hopeful in the future. Several promising gene therapies are currently under investigation. These include gene replacement, exon skipping, suppression of stop codons. More recently, a promising gene editing tool referred to as CRISPR/Cas9 offers exciting perspectives for restoring dystrophin expression in patients with DMD. This review intents to briefly describe these methods and comment on their advances. Since DMD is a genetic disorder, it should be treated by replacing the",

        "Gene therapies under investigation for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) primarily focus on restoring the expression of functional dystrophin protein, which is absent or nonfunctional in DMD patients due to mutations in the DMD gene. One approach is exon skipping, which uses antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to modify pre-mRNA splicing and produce a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein. Eteplirsen and golodirsen are two FDA-approved drugs that employ this strategy. Another approach involves adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer, where a shortened version of the dystrophin gene called microdystrophin is delivered to muscle cells using AAV vectors. Notable examples include PF-06939926 by Pfizer, SGT-001 by Solid Biosciences, and SRP-9001 by Sarepta Therapeutics. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing techniques are being explored to correct DMD-causing mutations directly in the DNA sequence or restore the reading frame disrupted by deletions or duplications. Although still in early stages of development, these innovative strategies hold promise for providing long-lasting therapeutic benefits for DMD patients.",
        "In the last decade, several gene therapies have been under investigation for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), aiming to restore dystrophin expression and improve muscle function. Promising approaches include gene replacement therapy, exon skipping, suppression of stop codons, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectorized gene therapies have emerged as a popular method for delivering these therapeutic strategies. Gene replacement involves introducing a functional copy of the dystrophin gene into patients\u0027 cells using AAV vectors. Exon skipping employs antisense oligonucleotides to modulate pre-mRNA splicing, allowing the production of partially functional dystrophin proteins by skipping specific exons in the mutated gene. Suppression of stop codons aims to bypass premature termination signals in the mRNA, enabling translation of full-length or near-full-length dystrophin proteins. Lastly, CRISPR/Cas9 technology offers an innovative approach to edit the DMD gene directly and restore its expression in affected individuals. These advances in therapeutic options hold great potential for treating DMD and other genetic diseases."

Several studies have shown that the NSAA score is reliable and valid for assessing functional abilities in DMD patients. The NSAA score has been found to be highly reliable, regardless of time lag between assessments, and strongly correlated with other functional measures and timed tests. Additionally, higher functional abilities at peak are associated with older age at loss of ambulation in DMD.

        "The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score is a reliable clinical outcome measure for assessing disease progression in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The NSAA is a 17-item scale designed to evaluate functional abilities in ambulant children with DMD, focusing on activities such as standing, walking, and climbing. It has been widely used in clinical trials and natural history studies to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy. Multiple studies have demonstrated the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the NSAA score in tracking functional decline over time in DMD patients. Furthermore, the NSAA has shown strong correlations with other established outcome measures like the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and timed function tests. However, it is important to note that the NSAA may not be suitable for all stages of DMD, as its applicability decreases when patients lose ambulation or have severe functional limitations. In summary, the NSAA score is a valuable tool for assessing disease progression in ambulant DMD patients but should be complemented by other outcome measures depending on the patient\u0027s functional status.",
        "The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) is a validated 17-item functional rating scale widely used to assess motor function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It has been shown to have high test-retest reliability for functional assessments, regardless of the time lag between assessments (up to 90 days) and across various age groups. Correlations among the functional measures and timed tests are strong, although less so with forced vital capacity (FVC). The NSAA score has been used to evaluate differences in disease progression between different genetic mutation groups and has been correlated with age at loss of ambulation (LOA) in DMD patients. Higher functional abilities at peak are associated with older age at LOA in DMD. These findings suggest that the NSAA score is a reliable clinical outcome for assessing disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

        "Golodirsen (VYONDYS 53) is an antisense oligonucleotide drug designed to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 53 skipping. It works by binding to a specific region of the DMD gene, allowing the cellular machinery to skip over exon 53 during mRNA processing and produce a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein. The FDA granted accelerated approval for golodirsen in December 2019 based on an increase in dystrophin production observed in skeletal muscle biopsies from treated patients. However, the clinical benefit of golodirsen, such as improved motor function, has not been definitively established. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating its long-term efficacy and safety profile. It is important to note that golodirsen is only applicable to a subset of DMD patients with mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping, which represents approximately 8% of the DMD population. In summary, golodirsen shows promise for treating DMD in a specific group of patients by increasing dystrophin production; however, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term effectiveness and safety.",

However, a recent study found that both daily prednisone and daily deflazacort were more effective than intermittent prednisone in improving a composite outcome comprising measures of motor function, pulmonary function, and satisfaction with treatment over 3 years. Therefore, while both drugs have shown efficacy in treating DMD patients, daily administration may be more beneficial than intermittent use.",

Comparative studies between deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone have shown mixed results. A randomized controlled trial by Griggs et al. (2016) demonstrated that deflazacort was associated with a slower decline in muscle strength and function compared to prednisone, suggesting a potential advantage for deflazacort. However, other studies have reported no significant differences in efficacy between the two drugs. It is important to note that deflazacort may have a more favorable side effect profile, with reduced weight gain and less impact on linear growth compared to prednisone/prednisolone. In conclusion, while there is some evidence suggesting that deflazacort might be more efficient than prednisone/prednisolone in treating DMD, the overall data remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to establish the superiority of one drug over the other definitively.",
        "Deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone are both standard treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to their ability to improve muscle strength, motor function, pulmonary function, and overall survival. Evidence from randomized clinical trials, prospective studies, meta-analyses, and post-hoc analyses suggests that patients receiving deflazacort experience similar or slower rates of functional decline compared with those receiving prednisone/prednisolone. A recent study comparing daily prednisone, daily deflazacort, and intermittent prednisone found that both daily prednisone and daily deflazacort were more effective than intermittent prednisone in improving a composite outcome comprising measures of motor function, pulmonary function, and satisfaction with treatment over three years. While the results indicate that both daily regimens are effective in managing DMD symptoms, it is not clear whether deflazacort is more efficient than prednisone/prednisolone as they show comparable efficacy in most aspects."

DMD is a severe, progressive muscle-wasting disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Viltolarsen works by promoting exon 53 skipping, which allows for the production of partially functional dystrophin protein in patients with amenable mutations. In a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02740972), viltolarsen demonstrated significant improvements in dystrophin expression and motor function compared to placebo. Based on these results, viltolarsen received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2020 under the brand name Viltepso for DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. However, it is important to note that this approval was based on surrogate endpoints, and further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety profile. Overall, viltolarsen appears to be a promising treatment option for specific subsets of DMD patients but requires additional research to fully establish its therapeutic potential.",
