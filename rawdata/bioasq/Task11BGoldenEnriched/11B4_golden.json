        "Friedreich\u0027s Ataxia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes progressive damage to the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The disease is caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. Frataxin plays an important role in the mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy within cells. In people with FA, the mutated FXN gene leads to reduced levels of frataxin, which disrupts mitochondrial function and causes oxidative stress. This, in turn, damages nerve cells and leads to the symptoms of FA, including difficulty with balance and coordination, muscle weakness, and speech problems. FA is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. While there is currently no cure for FA, treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals.",

        "Friedreich\u0027s Ataxia (FA) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which encodes for the protein frataxin. The most common mutation is an abnormal expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats within the first intron of the FXN gene. This expansion leads to reduced expression of frataxin, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress. Frataxin plays a crucial role in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and heme synthesis, both essential for proper functioning of various cellular processes. The deficiency of frataxin causes iron accumulation in mitochondria, leading to oxidative damage and ultimately cell death. FA primarily affects the nervous system and heart, causing progressive ataxia, muscle weakness, sensory loss, and cardiomyopathy. Although there is currently no cure for FA, ongoing research aims to develop therapies targeting the underlying genetic defect or mitigating its consequences on cellular function.",

The onset age of FA varies, but it typically occurs in childhood or adolescence, with symptoms appearing between the ages of 5 and 15 years old. However, in some cases, symptoms may not appear until adulthood.

Individuals with fewer than 300 GAA repeats tend to have later onset and milder symptoms, while those with more than 600 repeats usually develop symptoms earlier and experience more severe disease progression.

Other common symptoms include muscle weakness, speech problems, vision and hearing impairment, scoliosis, and heart issues. The disease is caused by mutations in the FXN gene that result in reduced levels of frataxin protein, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress within cells. There is currently no cure for Friedreich\u0027s Ataxia; treatment primarily focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life through physical therapy, assistive devices, medications for heart complications, and other supportive measures.",
        "Friedreich\u0027s ataxia is typically characterized by an onset age during the first or second decade of life. This progressive neurodegenerative disorder affects the nervous system and can lead to a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, loss of coordination, and speech difficulties. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for managing the condition and improving the quality of life for affected individuals. However, it is important to note that the onset age may vary among patients, with some cases presenting later in life."

        "DNA accessibility is thought to be of major importance in regulating gene expression. However, recent studies focusing on the quantitative nature of the accessibility signal reveal subtle differences between active enhancers and their different inactive counterparts: the closed silenced state and the accessible primed and repressed states. While the open structure as such is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers display a higher degree of accessibility than the primed and repressed states. In addition, another study has shown that euchromatin and heterochromatin can have very similar accessibilities, suggesting that transcription factors can penetrate heterochromatin. Together, these results show that many gene expression changes can happen independently of changes in the accessibility of local chromatin.",
        "Accessible enhancers are DNA sequences that can regulate gene expression by binding to transcription factors and promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase. However, not all accessible enhancers are necessarily active. In fact, recent studies have shown that many accessible enhancers may be in a primed but inactive state, waiting for specific signals or conditions to become fully active. This is supported by evidence showing that some enhancers are only activated under certain cellular contexts or developmental stages. Additionally, it has been observed that some enhancers may be accessible but lack the necessary chromatin modifications or co-factors required for activation. Therefore, while accessibility is a necessary prerequisite for enhancer activity, it does not guarantee it. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying enhancer activation and how they contribute to gene regulation in different biological contexts.",
        "Recent studies suggest that the relationship between enhancer accessibility and activity is more complex than previously thought. While open chromatin is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers display a higher degree of accessibility than primed and repressed states. However, DNA accessibility is not likely to be the primary determinant of gene regulation, as euchromatin and heterochromatin have similar accessibilities, suggesting that transcription factors can penetrate heterochromatin. Furthermore, changes in gene expression can occur independently of changes in local chromatin accessibility in the context of a single-factor perturbation. Therefore, while accessible enhancers may be more likely to be active than their closed counterparts, other factors such as transcription factor binding are also important determinants of enhancer activity."

In individuals with SMA, there is a deficiency of SMN protein due to mutations in the SMN1 gene. The severity of SMA depends on the number of copies of a related gene called SMN2, which can partially compensate for the loss of SMN1. However, even with multiple copies of SMN2, there is still a significant reduction in SMN protein levels, leading to motor neuron degeneration and muscle weakness.

The SMN1 gene encodes the SMN protein, which plays a crucial role in the maintenance and function of motor neurons. In individuals with SMA, insufficient levels of functional SMN protein lead to progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. There are four main types of SMA (type I-IV), classified based on age of onset and severity of symptoms. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene for their child to be affected. Although there is no cure for SMA, recent advances in treatment options such as nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec have shown promising results in improving motor function and survival rates among patients with this debilitating condition.",

As a devastating neuromuscular disease, SMA affects individuals across various age groups and presents with varying degrees of severity depending on the specific genetic defect involved."

        "The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction.",
        "The hallmarks of cancer are a set of characteristics that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, as proposed by Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg in their seminal paper published in 2000. These hallmarks include: 1) sustained proliferative signaling, which allows cancer cells to continuously divide and grow; 2) evasion of growth suppressors, enabling them to bypass cellular mechanisms that inhibit uncontrolled growth; 3) resistance to cell death, allowing them to avoid apoptosis or programmed cell death; 4) replicative immortality, granting them the ability to maintain telomeres and divide indefinitely; 5) induction of angiogenesis, promoting the formation of new blood vessels for nutrient supply; and 6) activation of invasion and metastasis, enabling the spread of cancer cells to other tissues. In a later update in 2011, two emerging hallmarks were added: 7) reprogramming of energy metabolism, which shifts cellular metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect); and 8) evading immune destruction by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. Additionally, two enabling characteristics were identified: genome instability and mutation, leading to genetic alterations that drive cancer progression; and tumor-promoting inflammation, which supports tumor growth and survival. Understanding these hallmarks is crucial for developing targeted therapies against various types of cancers."

        "Inflammatory myopathies are a group of rare autoimmune disorders that affect the muscles and cause inflammation. The most common types of inflammatory myopathies include dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. Dermatomyositis is characterized by skin rashes and muscle weakness, while polymyositis primarily affects the skeletal muscles. Inclusion body myositis typically affects older adults and causes progressive muscle weakness in the arms and legs. Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy is a rare type of inflammatory myopathy that causes severe muscle weakness and can be associated with cancer or exposure to certain medications. Diagnosis of these conditions involves a combination of clinical evaluation, blood tests, imaging studies, and muscle biopsy. Treatment may involve immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory drugs, as well as physical therapy to help maintain muscle strength and function.",

The known types of inflammatory myopathies include polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), inclusion body myositis (IBM), necrotizing myopathy (NM), antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) and overlap myositis (OM). PM and DM are the most common types, while IBM is more prevalent in older adults. NM is a rare type that causes rapid muscle weakness, while ASS is characterized by lung disease and joint inflammation. OM is a combination of two or more types of inflammatory myopathies. These diseases can cause muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue, among other symptoms. Diagnosis typically involves a physical exam, blood tests, imaging studies, and sometimes a muscle biopsy. Treatment may involve medications to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, as well as physical therapy to improve muscle strength and function.",
        "Inflammatory myopathies are a group of rare autoimmune disorders characterized by muscle inflammation and weakness. The four main types of inflammatory myopathies include: 1) Dermatomyositis (DM), which presents with skin rash and muscle weakness, often affecting the proximal muscles; 2) Polymyositis (PM), characterized by progressive muscle weakness in the absence of skin involvement, typically affecting proximal muscles as well; 3) Inclusion body myositis (IBM), a slowly progressive disorder that primarily affects distal muscles in older adults and is associated with the presence of rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregates within muscle fibers; and 4) Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM), a rapidly progressive form marked by severe muscle weakness and high levels of creatine kinase, with muscle biopsies showing necrotic muscle fibers without significant inflammation. These conditions can be idiopathic or associated with other systemic autoimmune diseases, malignancies, or infections. Diagnosis typically involves clinical evaluation, laboratory tests for autoantibodies and muscle enzymes, electromyography (EMG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and muscle biopsy. Treatment options include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and physical therapy to manage symptoms and improve function.",

PM primarily affects skeletal muscles, while DM involves both skin and muscle manifestations. IBM is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the presence of inclusion bodies within muscle fibers. NM, also known as necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM), is marked by rapid onset of severe muscle weakness and high levels of creatine kinase in the blood. ASS is associated with autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and may present with various clinical features such as interstitial lung disease, arthritis, and Raynaud\u0027s phenomenon. OM refers to cases where patients exhibit features of more than one inflammatory myopathy or other connective tissue diseases. Diagnosis typically involves clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, imaging studies, electromyography, and muscle biopsy. Treatment options vary depending on the specific type but often include immunosuppressive medications to manage inflammation and alleviate symptoms."

        "Each human has slightly different DNA sequences, called genetic variants, which make each of us unique. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an important avenue for undertaking an agnostic evaluation of the association between common genetic variants and the risk of disease. Recent advances in our understanding of human genetic variation and the technology to measure such variation have made GWAS feasible. Over the past few years, a multitude of GWAS has identified and replicated many associated variants. These associations could reveal the molecular mechanisms altered in common complex diseases and result in the identification of novel drug targets.",
        "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a type of genetic study that aims to identify genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits. GWAS analyze the entire genome of large groups of people to identify common genetic variants that may be associated with a particular disease or trait. These studies have been successful in identifying thousands of genetic variants associated with various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. GWAS can also provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of these diseases and help identify potential targets for drug development. However, it is important to note that GWAS only identify associations between genetic variants and diseases or traits and do not necessarily establish causality. Additionally, GWAS often require large sample sizes to achieve statistical significance and may not capture rare genetic variants that may also contribute to disease risk.",
        "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful research approach used to identify associations between genetic variants and human phenotypes, such as diseases or complex traits. By examining the entire genome, GWAS aim to detect common genetic variations that may contribute to an individual\u0027s risk of developing a particular condition. These studies have successfully mapped thousands of loci associated with complex traits, enriching our knowledge about the genetic basis of diseases and potentially leading to the identification of novel drug targets. However, the underlying mechanisms for many GWAS findings remain unclear, and they often explain only a limited amount of heritability. Despite these limitations, GWAS provide an important avenue for understanding human genetic variation and its impact on disease risk."

        "Leigh syndrome is a rare and severe neurological disorder that typically appears in infancy or early childhood. The incidence of Leigh syndrome is estimated to be between 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births worldwide. However, the exact prevalence of the disease may be underestimated due to its variable clinical presentation and difficulty in diagnosis. Leigh syndrome is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear genes that affect the function of mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy within cells. Symptoms of Leigh syndrome can include developmental delay, muscle weakness, seizures, respiratory problems, and vision and hearing loss. Treatment options for Leigh syndrome are limited and primarily focus on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. While there is currently no cure for Leigh syndrome, ongoing research into the underlying genetic causes of the disease may lead to new therapies in the future.",
        "Leigh syndrome (LS) is a mitochondrial encephalopathy that primarily affects children. It is estimated to have an incidence of 1:40,000 - 1:77,000 liveborn infants per year, making it the most common childhood mitochondrial encephalopathy. LS is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration and can lead to death within a few years of onset. The disease has a wide range of clinical presentations and can affect multiple organ systems, including the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys. While there is currently no cure for LS, early diagnosis and management of symptoms can improve outcomes for affected individuals. Genetic testing may also be helpful in identifying carriers of mutations associated with LS and informing reproductive decisions for at-risk families.",
        "Leigh syndrome, also known as subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, is a rare inherited neurometabolic disorder affecting the central nervous system. The incidence of Leigh syndrome is estimated to be approximately 1 in 40,000 live births worldwide. However, this number may vary across different populations and regions due to genetic factors and diagnostic challenges. Leigh syndrome is characterized by progressive loss of mental and motor abilities, leading to severe neurological impairments and often resulting in early death. It is caused by mutations in genes related to mitochondrial function or biogenesis, with over 75 genes identified so far. The clinical presentation of Leigh syndrome can be highly variable, making diagnosis difficult. Early detection and management are crucial for improving the quality of life for affected individuals and their families.",

        "Epigenetic modifications are molecular changes that affect gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Some major examples of epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA alterations. DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosine bases in the DNA molecule, often leading to gene silencing. Histone modifications encompass various chemical changes to histone proteins, such as methylation and acetylation, which can either activate or repress gene expression depending on the specific modification and its location. Chromatin remodeling refers to structural changes in chromatin that influence the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Non-coding RNA alterations involve small RNA molecules like microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally or through other mechanisms. These epigenetic modifications play crucial roles in various biological processes and have been implicated in the development of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer."

        "Transport of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is an essential step of eukaryotic gene expression. Messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) are produced as the nascent transcripts of RNA polymerase II in the cell nucleus and must undergo extensive maturational processing, including 5\u0027-end capping, splicing, and 3\u0027-end cleavage and polyadenylation.",
        "The process of converting precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to mature mRNA involves several key steps that occur within the cell nucleus of eukaryotic cells. These include pre-mRNA transcription, capping, splicing, polyadenylation, and transport to the cytoplasm for translation.",
        "The necessary steps for the transition from a precursor mRNA to a mature mRNA include capping, splicing, cleavage, and polyadenylation. Capping refers to the addition of a modified guanine nucleotide to the 5\u0027 end of the pre-mRNA, while splicing removes the non-coding introns and joins the coding exons. Cleavage involves the cutting of the pre-mRNA at a specific site downstream of the coding sequence, and polyadenylation adds a string of adenosine nucleotides to the 3\u0027 end of the mRNA.",
        "The necessary steps for the transition from a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to a mature mRNA include 5\u0027-end capping, splicing, and 3\u0027-end cleavage and polyadenylation. These processes remove introns, join exons, and add necessary structures to the mRNA molecule, preparing it for transportation out of the nucleus and subsequent protein synthesis.",
        "The process of mRNA maturation involves several steps that are essential for the production of a functional mRNA molecule. The first step is pre-mRNA processing, which includes capping, splicing, and polyadenylation. Capping involves the addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5\u0027 end of the pre-mRNA molecule, which protects it from degradation and facilitates its translation. Splicing removes introns from the pre-mRNA molecule and joins together exons to form a continuous coding sequence. This process is mediated by small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other splicing factors. Finally, polyadenylation adds a string of adenine nucleotides to the 3\u0027 end of the pre-mRNA molecule, which also helps protect it from degradation and plays a role in regulating its stability and translation efficiency. Once these steps are completed, the mature mRNA molecule can be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it can be translated into protein by ribosomes.",
        "The transition from a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to a mature mRNA involves several essential steps that occur during the process of RNA maturation. First, capping occurs at the 5\u0027 end of the pre-mRNA, where a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to protect the transcript from degradation and facilitate translation initiation. Second, splicing takes place, which involves the removal of introns (non-coding sequences) and ligation of exons (coding sequences) by the spliceosome, a complex composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other proteins. Splice sites are recognized by specific consensus sequences at exon-intron boundaries, ensuring accurate splicing. Alternative splicing can also occur, generating multiple mature mRNAs with different coding potentials from a single pre-mRNA molecule. Finally, polyadenylation occurs at the 3\u0027 end of the transcript, where a poly(A) tail consisting of approximately 200 adenine nucleotides is added by poly(A) polymerase. This tail enhances mRNA stability and promotes nuclear export as well as translation efficiency. Once these modifications are complete, the mature mRNA is transported out of the nucleus through nuclear pores into the cytoplasm for translation into protein by ribosomes.",
        "The transition from precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to mature mRNA involves several critical processing steps. Firstly, the 5\u0027-end of the pre-mRNA undergoes capping, which helps protect the transcript from degradation and facilitates translation initiation. Next, RNA splicing occurs, where introns are removed and exons are joined together to generate a continuous coding sequence. This process can create diverse mature mRNA molecules from a limited number of genes through alternative splicing events that include or exclude specific introns and exons. Finally, the 3\u0027-end of the pre-mRNA undergoes cleavage and polyadenylation, adding a poly(A) tail that enhances stability and promotes nuclear export. Once these processing steps are complete, the mature mRNA is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation into proteins by ribosomes."

Infants with type 1 SMA have difficulty breathing, swallowing, and moving their limbs. Type 2 SMA usually presents between 6-18 months of age and is characterized by delayed motor milestones and progressive muscle weakness. Children with type 2 SMA may be able to sit independently but are unable to walk without assistance. Type 3 SMA, also known as Kugelberg-Welander disease, typically presents after 18 months of age and is characterized by a milder course with slower progression of symptoms. Individuals with type 3 SMA may be able to walk independently for some time before experiencing significant mobility limitations. Finally, type 4 SMA is a rare adult-onset form that typically presents in the third or fourth decade of life with mild to moderate muscle weakness and atrophy.",

Type 1 is the most severe form, with symptoms appearing in infancy and often leading to death within the first few years of life due to respiratory failure. Type 2 has an intermediate severity, with onset typically occurring in early childhood; affected individuals may have limited mobility but can live into adulthood with proper care. Type 3 presents during late childhood or adolescence and is characterized by milder symptoms, allowing for normal life expectancy; patients usually maintain ambulation but may experience progressive muscle weakness over time. Lastly, Type 4 is the mildest form, with adult-onset and slow progression; individuals with this type generally have a normal lifespan. All forms of SMA are caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which leads to reduced levels of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein essential for motor neuron function.",

It is caused by mutations in the PABPN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1. This protein plays an important role in processing messenger RNA molecules, which are essential for producing proteins. The mutated PABPN1 gene leads to the production of an abnormal form of the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 protein that accumulates in muscle cells and causes damage over time. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve disruptions in normal cellular processes such as protein folding and degradation. OPMD typically develops in adulthood and can lead to progressive weakness and wasting of the affected muscles, including those involved in swallowing and speaking. There is currently no cure for OPMD, but treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",
        "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects muscle function, causing slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness. The disease is caused by the abnormal expansion of the alanine-encoding (GCN)n trinucleotide repeat in the exon 1 of the polyadenosine (poly[A]) binding protein nuclear 1 gene. This leads to an accumulation of toxic intranuclear aggregates in affected cells, which ultimately results in muscle degeneration and weakness. A common cause of OPMD is the short expansion of a GCG or GCA trinucleotide repeat in PABPN1 gene. While there is currently no cure for OPMD, several treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals. These include physical therapy, speech therapy, and surgical interventions such as eyelid surgery or feeding tube placement.",
        "Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, particularly affecting the muscles of the eyelids and throat. The primary cause of OPMD is a mutation in the PABPN1 gene, which encodes for polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1. This protein plays a crucial role in mRNA processing and stability. The mutation involves an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide repeat sequence (GCN) within the PABPN1 gene, leading to an elongated polyalanine tract in the protein. This expanded polyalanine tract causes misfolding and aggregation of PABPN1, resulting in intranuclear inclusion bodies that impair normal cellular function and ultimately lead to muscle cell degeneration. OPMD follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene from either parent is sufficient to cause the disease. However, symptoms typically manifest later in life, with onset usually occurring between 40-60 years of age.",

        "The cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell, leading to its division and duplication. Cell division requires cell cycle checkpoints that are used by the cell to both monitor and regulate the progress of the cell cycle. Deregulation of the cell cycle underlies the aberrant cell proliferation that characterizes cancer and loss of cell cycle checkpoint control promotes genetic instability.\n\nTumor suppressor genes are genes that protect the cell from a single event or multiple events leading to cancer. When these genes mutate, the cell can progress to a cancerous state. We now recognize that tumor suppressor genes regulate diverse cellular activities, including cell cycle checkpoint responses, detection and repair of DNA damage, protein ubiquitination and degradation, mitogenic signaling, cell specification, differentiation and migration, and tumor angiogenesis.",
        "Negative cell-cycle regulators that can cause cancer when mutated are commonly referred to as tumor suppressor genes. These genes play a crucial role in controlling cell division and preventing uncontrolled proliferation, which could lead to the formation of tumors. Tumor suppressor genes function by inhibiting cell cycle progression, promoting DNA repair, and inducing apoptosis in response to cellular stress or damage. Some well-known examples of tumor suppressor genes include TP53 (p53), RB1 (retinoblastoma protein), and CDKN2A (p16INK4a). Mutations or loss of function in these genes can disrupt their ability to regulate the cell cycle, thereby contributing to the development of cancer. In many cases, both copies of a tumor suppressor gene must be inactivated for a complete loss of function, following Knudson\u0027s two-hit hypothesis. The identification and study of tumor suppressor genes have significantly advanced our understanding of cancer biology and provided potential targets for therapeutic interventions."

Studies have estimated that the incidence of OPMD ranges from 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 10,000 individuals worldwide. However, these estimates may be conservative due to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. Symptoms typically begin in adulthood and include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), drooping eyelids (ptosis), weakness in the facial muscles, and limb weakness. There is currently no cure for OPMD, but treatment options such as speech therapy and surgical interventions can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals. Genetic counseling is also recommended for individuals with a family history of OPMD or those who are carriers of the disease-causing gene mutation.",

However, some populations may have a higher incidence of the disease due to a strong founder effect, with rates as high as 1:600 reported. OPMD is a late-onset disease that typically presents in individuals over the age of 40 and is characterized by progressive weakness and wasting of muscles in the eyes, throat, and limbs. The disease is caused by an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the PABPN1 gene, which leads to the formation of protein aggregates within affected cells. While there is currently no cure for OPMD, treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals.",
        "Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, particularly affecting the muscles of the eyelids and throat. The incidence of OPMD varies across different populations due to its association with specific genetic backgrounds. In general, the prevalence is estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide. However, certain populations have a higher incidence of the disease. For example, it is more common among French-Canadians from Quebec, where the prevalence is approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals. Similarly, Bukhara Jews from Uzbekistan and Hispanic New Mexicans also show an increased incidence of OPMD. The condition is caused by mutations in the PABPN1 gene that lead to abnormal protein aggregation within muscle cells, ultimately resulting in muscle degeneration and weakness over time. Early diagnosis and management can help improve patients\u0027 quality of life and slow down disease progression.",
        "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare genetic muscle disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 80,000 individuals worldwide. This late-onset disease primarily affects the muscles responsible for eye and throat movement, leading to symptoms such as difficulty swallowing and drooping eyelids. It is important to note that the prevalence of OPMD can be significantly higher in certain populations due to a strong founder effect; in some cases, it may affect as many as 1 in 600 individuals. The variation in incidence highlights the importance of understanding the genetic factors contributing to this condition and developing targeted therapies for affected populations."

The lac operon is a set of genes that encode proteins involved in the transport and metabolism of lactose, allowing E. coli to utilize this sugar as an energy source when glucose is scarce. The primary components of the lac operon include three structural genes: lacZ, lacY, and lacA. The lacZ gene encodes β-galactosidase, an enzyme responsible for cleaving lactose into glucose and galactose. The lacY gene encodes lactose permease, a membrane protein that facilitates the transport of lactose into the cell. Lastly, the lacA gene encodes thiogalactoside transacetylase, which detoxifies certain byproducts generated during lactose metabolism.

It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA, which affect the function of mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles within cells. Leigh syndrome can be inherited in different ways depending on the underlying genetic cause. In cases where it is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, it is usually inherited maternally, meaning that affected mothers pass the condition to all of their children. In contrast, when Leigh syndrome is caused by mutations in nuclear DNA, it follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning that affected individuals inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent). Genetic testing can help identify the specific genetic cause of Leigh syndrome in affected individuals and their family members, which can inform reproductive decisions and potential treatment options.",

The disease can be inherited through autosomal recessive, X-linked, or maternal transmission. Cases with maternal inheritance are due to a mitochondrial DNA point mutation. LS is characterized by progressive multisystem involvement, including the central nervous system, cardiac and respiratory systems. The most commonly affected tissues are those with high energy demands such as the brainstem, basal ganglia, and optic nerves. Symptoms usually appear in infancy or early childhood and include developmental delay, weakness, hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, and respiratory failure. Genetic testing is necessary for diagnosis confirmation. Unfortunately, there is no cure for LS yet; treatment mainly focuses on supportive care to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.",
        "Leigh syndrome, also known as subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, is a rare inherited neurometabolic disorder. It is primarily inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the gene in each cell must have mutations for an individual to be affected. In most cases, the parents of a child with Leigh syndrome are carriers of one copy of the mutated gene but do not show symptoms themselves. However, some forms of Leigh syndrome can be inherited through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), following a maternal inheritance pattern. In this case, only the mother\u0027s mtDNA is passed on to her children, and all offspring will inherit the mutation if the mother carries it. Additionally, there are rare instances where Leigh syndrome follows an X-linked inheritance pattern involving mutations in specific genes located on the X chromosome. Overall, Leigh syndrome\u0027s inheritance patterns can vary depending on the specific genetic mutations involved, with autosomal recessive being the most common mode of inheritance.",

SBMA is characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of the bulbar facial and limb muscles. SBMA is also associated with androgen insensitivity gynecomastia testicular atrophy and infertility. SBMA is caused by a toxic gainoffunction of the mutant AR which is thought to be a transcription factor. SBMA is also characterized by the formation of intranuclear inclusions which are composed of mutant AR and several other proteins including heat shock proteins (HSPs) ubiquitin and p62sequestosome1 (p62SQSTM1). In this review we discuss the role of HSPs and p62SQSTM1 in the pathogenesis of SBMA. We also discuss the therapeutic potential of HSPs and p62SQSTM1 in the treatment of SBMA.Introduction Sec1In the last decade the development of highthroughput sequencing (HTS) technologies",

It is caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, leading to an abnormal accumulation of toxic proteins in motor neurons. This results in progressive muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the limbs, face, throat, and tongue. Symptoms typically appear in adulthood and worsen over time, but the severity can vary widely among affected individuals. There is currently no cure for SBMA, but treatments such as physical therapy and medication can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Ongoing research is focused on developing new therapies that target the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease.",
        "Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Mutant AR is believed to act in motoneurons, leading to the development of SBMA. The disease primarily affects males and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the limbs and facial muscles. Symptoms typically appear in adulthood, with age of onset ranging from the third to sixth decade of life. There is currently no cure for SBMA, but treatments such as physical therapy and medication can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals.",
        "Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy\u0027s disease, is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. The AR gene is located on the X chromosome and encodes for the androgen receptor protein, which plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of male sex hormones called androgens. The mutation involves an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide repeat sequence (CAG) within the AR gene, leading to an elongated polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor protein. This expanded polyglutamine tract causes misfolding of the protein, resulting in aggregation and accumulation within motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. The toxic gain-of-function mechanism associated with these aggregates leads to selective degeneration of motor neurons, causing progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and other symptoms characteristic of SBMA. As SBMA is an X-linked recessive disorder, it predominantly affects males; females can be carriers but usually do not exhibit symptoms or have milder manifestations due to random X-inactivation.",

        "Yes, there is a rare type of SMA known as Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1).",
        "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder that affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. SMA is classified into four types based on age of onset, severity, and progression of symptoms. However, recent research has identified additional subtypes of SMA that are not included in the traditional classification system. These subtypes include adult-onset SMA, which typically presents with milder symptoms later in life; congenital SMA, which presents at birth or shortly thereafter and can be more severe than type 1 SMA; and intermediate SMA, which falls between types 2 and 3 in terms of symptom severity and age of onset. Additionally, there are several rare forms of SMA caused by mutations in different genes that can present with unique clinical features. While types 1-4 remain the most commonly recognized forms of SMA, it is important for clinicians to be aware of these additional subtypes as they may require different management strategies and have implications for genetic counseling.",
        "Yes, there are other types of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) besides types 1-4. One exceptionally rare type of SMA is SMA with Respiratory Distress Type 1 (SMARD1), which affects the respiratory system. Additionally, there have been no convincing reports of X-linked SMA thus far. It is worth noting that in childhood SMA (Type 1), the total AChE activity was either normal or decreased, as it was in other SMA groups and disease controls such as ALS and X-linked SMA. However, further research is needed to fully understand the different types and subtypes of SMA and their underlying mechanisms.",
        "Yes, besides the well-known types 1-4 of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), there are other less common forms. These include adult-onset SMA, also known as SMA type 5 or Kennedy\u0027s disease, which is a rare X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the androgen receptor gene. Another form is distal SMA, which affects the distal muscles of the limbs and can be further classified into several subtypes based on age of onset and inheritance pattern. Additionally, some cases of congenital SMA with arthrogryposis have been reported, characterized by joint contractures present at birth. It is important to note that these rarer forms of SMA may have overlapping clinical features with other neuromuscular disorders, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Genetic testing plays a crucial role in confirming the specific type of SMA and guiding appropriate management strategies for affected individuals.",
        "Yes, there are other types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) besides the common types 1-4. One such example is spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), which is an exceptionally rare form of SMA characterized by early-onset respiratory failure and progressive muscle weakness. Although there have been mentions of X-linked SMA in the literature, no convincing reports have been published to confirm its existence. In addition to these, research continues to uncover new genetic mutations and phenotypes associated with SMA, expanding our understanding of this group of neuromuscular disorders."

It is caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. Frataxin plays an important role in the mitochondria, where it helps to regulate iron levels and produce energy for cells. In people with FA, the mutated FXN gene leads to reduced levels of frataxin, which can cause a buildup of iron and oxidative stress in cells. This can lead to degeneration of nerve cells and muscle weakness, as well as symptoms such as ataxia (loss of coordination), speech difficulties, vision problems, hearing loss, and heart disease. There is currently no cure for FA, but treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include physical therapy, speech therapy, assistive devices, medications for heart problems or diabetes if present, and genetic counseling for affected individuals and their families.",

        "Friedreich\u0027s Ataxia (FA) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive damage to the nervous system, leading to symptoms such as muscle weakness, loss of coordination, and impaired speech. It is caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which encodes frataxin, a protein essential for proper mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis. The most common mutation involves an abnormal expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats within the gene, resulting in reduced frataxin production. This deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, ultimately causing degeneration of nerve fibers and various tissues. FA typically presents during childhood or adolescence with initial symptoms like unsteady gait and difficulty with balance. As the disease progresses, affected individuals may develop scoliosis, heart problems (such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), diabetes mellitus, and sensory deficits. There is currently no cure for FA; however, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life through physical therapy, assistive devices, medications for cardiac issues or diabetes management, and ongoing monitoring of disease progression. Researchers are actively exploring potential therapies targeting the underlying genetic defect or mitigating its consequences on cellular function.",

        "Homeotic transformation refers to a genetic phenomenon where one body part is replaced by another during development. This process is controlled by homeobox genes, which are responsible for the formation of body segments and the differentiation of tissues. Homeotic transformations can result in abnormal morphological structures and developmental defects, such as the replacement of antennae with legs in fruit flies or the transformation of petals into sepals in plants. These transformations can occur spontaneously due to mutations or environmental factors, but they can also be induced experimentally through gene manipulation techniques. The study of homeotic transformations has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying embryonic development and pattern formation, as well as their evolutionary conservation across different species. Understanding these processes may have important implications for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications.",
        "Homeotic transformation refers to a developmental anomaly in which one body part or structure is replaced by another that is morphologically and functionally distinct, typically due to alterations in the expression of homeotic genes. These genes, also known as Hox genes, play a crucial role in determining the identity and positioning of body segments during embryonic development. Homeotic transformations can result from mutations or misregulation of Hox genes, leading to changes in their spatial or temporal expression patterns. For example, a classic example of homeotic transformation is the Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila melanogaster, where legs develop in place of antennae on the head. Understanding homeotic transformations has been fundamental for uncovering the genetic mechanisms underlying body plan organization and evolution across diverse species."

        "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. It is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which results in reduced levels of the SMN protein essential for motor neuron function and maintenance. SMA is classified into four types (SMA I-IV) based on age of onset and severity, with Type I being the most severe and presenting in infancy, while Type IV manifests in adulthood with milder symptoms. Common clinical features include muscle weakness, respiratory difficulties, feeding problems, and impaired mobility. Diagnosis typically involves genetic testing to identify SMN1 mutations and quantify SMN2 copy numbers, which can influence disease severity. Management strategies focus on supportive care to improve quality of life and may include respiratory support, nutritional intervention, physical therapy, and orthopedic interventions. Recently developed therapies such as nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec target the underlying molecular defects to increase functional SMN protein levels and have shown promising results in improving motor function and survival rates among affected individuals.",

        "Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but it predominantly occurs in adults with increased age (especially older than 60 years) and/or certain underlying medical comorbidities. These include obesity, diabetes, asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic neurologic disorders (e.g., dementia), cirrhosis, immunocompromising conditions, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Certain demographic features have also been associated with more severe illness, such as African-American origin or Hispanic ethnicity.",
        "Several factors have been associated with severe COVID-19. Age is a significant risk factor, with older adults being more likely to experience severe symptoms and require hospitalization. Individuals with underlying medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are also at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Additionally, male sex has been identified as a risk factor for severe disease. Other factors that may contribute to the severity of COVID-19 include smoking history and immunocompromised status. It is important to note that while these factors have been associated with increased risk of severe disease, anyone can develop severe COVID-19 regardless of age or underlying health conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to continue practicing preventive measures such as wearing masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing to reduce the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations."

According to studies and case reports, the presence of the virus in breast milk has been rarely detected. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 continue breastfeeding while following appropriate precautions, such as wearing a mask and practicing hand hygiene. Breast milk provides numerous health benefits to infants, including essential nutrients and antibodies that help protect against infections. Additionally, some research indicates that breast milk may contain specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, potentially offering some protection to the infant. However, it is important to note that close contact between an infected mother and her baby could still pose a risk of transmission through respiratory droplets. Therefore, it is crucial for mothers with COVID-19 to follow recommended guidelines to minimize the risk of transmission while continuing to provide the benefits of breastfeeding.",

        "Chromatin, a complex of DNA and proteins, is tightly packed into a highly organized structure called the nucleosome inside the nucleus. Nucleosomes are the fundamental repeating units of chromatin and consist of approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins, which include two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The nucleosomes are connected by linker DNA and further compacted through interactions with additional histone proteins such as histone H1. This organization allows for efficient packaging of the long DNA molecules within the confined space of the nucleus while still permitting access to genetic information for processes like transcription, replication, and repair. The degree of chromatin compaction can vary depending on cellular context and regulatory mechanisms, ultimately influencing gene expression patterns in response to various signals or environmental cues."

        "Recent studies have revealed that the deregulation of distal gene regulatory elements, such as enhancers, appears in several pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. In cancer, mutations often misregulate enhancers that normally control the signal-dependent expression of growth-related genes. This misregulation can result from trans-acting mechanisms, such as activation of the transcription factors or epigenetic regulators that control enhancer activity or can be caused in cis by direct mutations that alter the activity of the enhancer or its target gene specificity.

        "Enhancers are regulatory elements that control gene expression by binding to transcription factors and promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter region. In cancer, enhancers can play a critical role in driving oncogenic transcriptional programs by activating genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Enhancer activation can occur through various mechanisms, including genetic alterations such as amplifications or translocations, epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation or DNA methylation, and aberrant signaling pathways. Recent studies have shown that enhancer hijacking is a common mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer, where non-coding mutations can create de novo enhancers or redirect existing ones to drive oncogenic gene expression. Targeting enhancer-driven transcriptional programs has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, with several ongoing clinical trials testing small molecule inhibitors of key transcriptional regulators or chromatin modifiers involved in enhancer regulation.",
        "Enhancers are regulatory DNA sequences that play a crucial role in the spatial and temporal control of gene expression. In cancer, enhancers can contribute to tumorigenesis through various mechanisms. First, they may undergo genetic alterations such as mutations, amplifications, or deletions, leading to aberrant activation or repression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Second, epigenetic modifications at enhancer regions, including changes in histone marks and DNA methylation patterns, can result in dysregulated gene expression contributing to cancer development and progression. Third, the three-dimensional organization of chromatin can bring enhancers into close proximity with target genes via chromosomal looping; alterations in this architecture may lead to misregulation of gene expression in cancer cells. Finally, enhancer hijacking events can occur when structural variations cause an active enhancer to be relocated near a normally silent oncogene, driving its overexpression. Overall, the dysregulation of enhancers in cancer highlights their importance as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers for various malignancies."

        "In eukaryotes, it is generally assumed that translation initiation occurs at the AUG codon closest to the messenger RNA 5\u0027 cap, which codes for methionine; hence, an initial assumption would be that all proteins should contain a methionine at their N-terminus (i.e., start site). However, this is not the case mostly for two reasons. First, in certain cases, initiation can occur at codons differing from AUG, which may still code for methionine (e.g., AGG) or less commonly another amino acid (e.g., GUC coding for valine). Moreover, N-terminal methionine can be cleaved after translation by the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase and this removal can be crucial for the function and stability of the final protein. For these reasons, not all proteins start with methionine at their N-terminus.",
        "Methionine is commonly considered as the first amino acid in most proteins. However, not all proteins start with methionine. In some cases, the initial methionine residue is removed post-translationally by specific enzymes called aminopeptidases. Additionally, alternative translation initiation sites can also lead to the production of protein isoforms that lack the N-terminal methionine residue. Moreover, some proteins have an initiator tRNA that carries a formylated methionine instead of a regular methionine at their N-terminus. This formyl group is usually removed later by deformylases. Therefore, while methionine is often present at the beginning of many proteins, it is not always required for proper protein function or stability.",
        "All proteins do not necessarily start with methionine, but it is common for eukaryotic and archaeal proteins to begin with this amino acid. During the initiation of translation, the first codon in the mRNA sequence is typically an AUG codon, which codes for methionine. This process is facilitated by the initiator tRNA (tRNAi^Met) that carries methionine and recognizes the start codon. However, there are exceptions to this rule. In some cases, alternative start codons such as CUG, GUG, or UUG can be used to initiate translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These alternative start codons usually code for amino acids like leucine or valine instead of methionine. Additionally, post-translational modifications can occur after protein synthesis, leading to the removal of the initial methionine or its modification into another amino acid like acetylated methionine or formylmethionine (fMet), which is commonly found in bacterial proteins. Therefore, while many proteins do initially start with methionine due to the canonical AUG start codon, there are exceptions where alternative initiation events or post-translational modifications result in proteins that do not begin with this amino acid."

Analyses at single loci also support roles for LEF1, RB1, IRF4, and PAX3 acting in combination with MITF, while sequence motif analyses suggest that additional transcription factors co-localize with MITF at many melanocyte-specific regulatory elements. Nonetheless, the precise biochemical functions of each of these MITF collaborators and their contributions to gene expression remain to be elucidated.",
        "Several transcription factors have been identified as essential for the development and maintenance of the melanocyte lineage. Among them, MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) is considered a master regulator of melanocyte differentiation and survival. Other important transcription factors include SOX10, PAX3, and LEF1. SOX10 plays a crucial role in the specification of neural crest cells, which give rise to melanocytes, while PAX3 is involved in the early stages of melanocyte development. LEF1 has been shown to regulate MITF expression and promote melanocyte differentiation. Additionally, several other transcription factors have been implicated in regulating specific aspects of melanocyte biology, such as IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4), which is involved in pigmentation and UV response, and TFEB (transcription factor EB), which regulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy in melanocytes. Understanding the roles of these transcription factors in melanocyte biology may provide insights into the pathogenesis of melanoma and other pigmentary disorders.",

        "Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, primarily affecting the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles. FSHD2 is caused by mutations in the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1) gene located on chromosome 18. These mutations lead to epigenetic changes, specifically hypomethylation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array on chromosome 4q35. This hypomethylation results in the aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene, which encodes a transcription factor that is normally silenced in adult tissues. The ectopic expression of DUX4 leads to the activation of various target genes that contribute to muscle pathology and ultimately cause muscle degeneration observed in FSHD2 patients. It is important to note that FSHD2 shares similar clinical features with FSHD1; however, they have distinct genetic causes, with FSHD1 being associated with a contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array rather than SMCHD1 mutations.",

In summary, FSHD2 is caused by mutations in the SMCHD1 gene that disrupt chromatin methylation regulation and result in aberrant DUX4 expression in skeletal muscles."

        "Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a rare, X-linked and adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of trinucleotide cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the androgen receptor gene. This leads to the formation of a polyglutamine tract that impairs the normal functioning of motor neurons, resulting in muscle weakness and wasting. SBMA primarily affects males, with symptoms typically appearing in mid-adulthood. The disease can manifest as progressive difficulty with speech and swallowing, muscle cramps, tremors, and respiratory failure. There is currently no cure for SBMA, but treatments such as physical therapy and medication can help manage symptoms. Research efforts are focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms of the disease to develop more effective therapies.",
        "Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy\u0027s disease, is a rare, adult-onset, X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. It primarily affects males, with symptoms typically emerging between the ages of 30 and 50. SBMA is caused by an expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, leading to an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the AR protein. This results in misfolded AR proteins that aggregate within motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, causing neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. The clinical manifestations of SBMA include muscle cramps, fasciculations, limb and bulbar weakness, gynecomastia, and reduced fertility or erectile dysfunction due to hormonal imbalances. Diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing for CAG repeat expansions in the AR gene. Currently, there is no cure for SBMA; treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life through physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and supportive care. Research into potential therapies targeting the underlying molecular mechanisms is ongoing.",

This expansion encodes a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor protein, leading to its dysfunction. SBMA primarily affects males due to its X-linked inheritance pattern and manifests as progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and bulbar symptoms such as difficulty swallowing and speaking. There is currently no cure for SBMA, but symptomatic treatments can help manage the condition."

        "Female carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually asymptomatic, but some may experience muscle weakness and cramps, fatigue, and myalgia. These symptoms are related to the skewed X-chromosome inactivation that occurs in females carrying a DMD mutation. In rare cases, female carriers may develop cardiomyopathy or respiratory insufficiency. The risk of developing these complications increases with age and is higher in carriers with a larger proportion of cells expressing the mutated gene. Female carriers should be monitored regularly for signs of cardiac or respiratory involvement, especially if they have a family history of DMD or if their carrier status was identified through prenatal testing. Genetic counseling is recommended for carriers and their families to discuss the risks associated with DMD carrier status and the options available for reproductive planning.",

        "Female carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) often do not exhibit the severe symptoms seen in affected males. However, some carriers may experience mild to moderate symptoms due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation or manifesting carrier status. Common symptoms in female carriers of DMD include muscle weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles of the limbs; muscle cramps and fatigue; reduced endurance during physical activities; and joint pain or stiffness. In rare cases, female carriers may develop dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart becomes enlarged and weakened, leading to heart failure. Additionally, some studies have reported an increased risk of cognitive and emotional difficulties among female DMD carriers, such as learning disabilities and mood disorders. It is important to note that the severity and presence of these symptoms can vary greatly among individuals, with some carriers remaining asymptomatic throughout their lives.",

        "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nerves, causing muscle weakness and wasting in the arms, legs, hands, and feet. There are several types of CMT, each with its own genetic cause and clinical presentation. The most common types are CMT1, CMT2, and CMTX. CMT1 is caused by mutations in genes that affect the production of myelin, a substance that surrounds nerve fibers and helps them conduct signals. This type typically presents with early onset symptoms such as foot drop and difficulty walking. CMT2 is caused by mutations in genes that affect the structure or function of nerve fibers themselves. This type usually presents later in life than CMT1 and may involve more severe symptoms such as muscle wasting and sensory loss. Finally, CMTX is caused by mutations in a gene on the X chromosome and can affect both males and females equally. It typically presents with symptoms similar to those seen in other forms of CMT but may also include hearing loss or intellectual disability depending on the specific mutation involved.",

Clinically, CMT can be divided into two main types: a demyelinating type (CMT1, CMT3, CMT4 and CMTX1) and an axonal type (CMT2). The subdivision into demyelinating and axonal types was a milestone and is still valid for the majority of patients. Other rare variants include severe early-onset axonal neuropathy (CMT type 5), optic atrophy (CMT type 6), and forms with associated pyramidal features (CMT5).

        "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) is a group of inherited peripheral neuropathies characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sensory loss. CMT is classified into several types based on the affected genes, mode of inheritance, and clinical features. The main types are CMT1, CMT2, CMT3, CMT4, and CMTX. CMT1 is further divided into subtypes (CMT1A, CMT1B, etc.) and primarily affects the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers. It is caused by mutations in genes such as PMP22, MPZ, and EGR2. CMT2 affects the axons within nerves and results from mutations in genes like MFN2, GARS, NEFL among others. Both CMT1 and 2 have autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. In contrast, CMT3 or Dejerine-Sottas disease presents early in life with severe demyelination due to mutations in PMP22 or MPZ genes. CMT4 comprises various autosomal recessive subtypes (CMT4A-J) affecting both myelin sheath and axons with mutations in different genes like GDAP1 or SH3TC2. Lastly, CMTX is an X-linked form caused by mutations in the GJB1 gene encoding connexin-32 protein that affects both myelin sheath and axons. Accurate diagnosis of specific types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease relies on genetic testing alongside clinical presentation and electrophysiological studies.",
        "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) is a group of inherited, clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases characterized by length-dependent degeneration of axons in the peripheral nervous system. CMT can be broadly divided into two main types: demyelinating (CMT1, CMT3, CMT4, and CMTX1) and axonal (CMT2). The most common subtype is CMT1A, which results from mutations or duplications on chromosome 17. CMT3, also known as Dejerine-Sottas disease, and CMT4 are recessive forms. CMT5 is associated with pyramidal features, while CMTX refers to X-linked forms of the disease. One such X-linked form is CMTX6, caused by a missense mutation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 gene (PDK3). Intermediate conduction velocities are often found in males with X-linked CMT (CMTX), and different intermediate types have been identified. Additionally, some variants of the disease present with optic atrophy (CMT type 6), which has been described with autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked modes of inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6 and approximately one-third of dominantly inherited cases of axonal degenerative forms (CMT type 2A)."

        "Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1) is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. It is caused by a deletion in the D4Z4 region on chromosome 4, which leads to the abnormal expression of a protein called DUX4. This protein is normally only expressed during embryonic development but in FSHD1 patients it is reactivated in muscle cells causing muscle degeneration. The severity of symptoms can vary widely between individuals and even within families with the same genetic mutation. There is currently no cure for FSHD1, but treatments are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Genetic counseling and testing are recommended for individuals with a family history of FSHD1 or those experiencing symptoms consistent with the condition. Ongoing research aims to better understand the underlying mechanisms of FSHD1 and develop more effective treatments for this debilitating disease.",

FSHD1 and FSHD2 are two types of the disease that have different genetic causes but are phenotypically indistinguishable. In FSHD1, this deletion leads to an abnormal expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle, which triggers a cascade of events leading to muscle degeneration and weakness. The exact mechanism by which DUX4 causes muscle damage is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve changes in gene expression and protein interactions. While there is currently no cure for FSHD1, ongoing research aims to better understand its underlying mechanisms and develop targeted therapies to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life for affected individuals.",

In FSHD1, the ectopic expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscles leads to the characteristic symptoms of facial-scapular-humeral myodystrophy Landouzy-Dejerine (FSHD).

It is caused by mutations in genes that encode for proteins involved in maintaining the structure and function of the nucleus of muscle cells. EDMD typically presents in childhood or adolescence with symptoms such as muscle weakness, joint contractures, and cardiac abnormalities. The disease progresses slowly over time, leading to increasing disability and reduced life expectancy. There are currently no cures for EDMD, but treatment options include physical therapy, orthopedic interventions to manage joint contractures, and medications to manage cardiac complications. Genetic counseling is also recommended for affected individuals and their families to better understand the inheritance pattern of the disease.",
        "Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) is a rare, X-linked genetic disorder that affects muscle and heart function. It typically presents in childhood or adolescence with joint contractures, muscle weakness, and cardiac abnormalities. EDMD is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in maintaining the structure and function of the nucleus of muscle cells. The most common form of EDMD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding emerin, a protein that helps anchor the nucleus to the cytoskeleton. EDMD can lead to progressive muscle wasting and weakness, as well as heart problems such as arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy. Treatment options are limited and focus on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families due to the hereditary nature of this condition.",
        "Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, joint contractures, and cardiac abnormalities. It primarily affects skeletal muscles and the heart, leading to muscle atrophy, reduced mobility, and life-threatening heart complications. EDMD can be inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner. The condition is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in nuclear envelope structure and function, such as EMD (emerin), LMNA (lamin A/C), and FHL1 (four-and-a-half LIM domains 1). Symptoms typically manifest during childhood or adolescence with early contractures of the elbows, ankles, and neck. Muscle weakness progresses slowly from the upper arms and lower legs to other areas of the body. Cardiac involvement includes conduction defects like atrioventricular block and arrhythmias that may necessitate pacemaker implantation. Management of EDMD involves a multidisciplinary approach including physical therapy for maintaining mobility, orthopedic interventions for contractures, and regular cardiac monitoring to address potential complications.",
        "Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) is an early-onset, slowly-progressive group of myopathies characterized by joint contractures, muscle weakness, and cardiac abnormalities. It is an uncommon, gradually progressive X-linked disorder that can result in rigid spinal deformity. EDMD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding emerin, a protein essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells. The condition typically presents with symptoms such as limited joint mobility, muscle wasting, and heart problems that may lead to life-threatening complications if left untreated."
