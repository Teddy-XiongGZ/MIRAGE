    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is in active labor with regular contractions every 4 minutes, but now she is having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is hypotonic uterine dysfunction. This is characterized by a decrease in the frequency, duration, and intensity of contractions, leading to a prolonged labor. It is important to rule out other causes of obstructed labor, such as a lower uterine retraction ring or primary dysfunctional labor, but based on the given information, hypotonic uterine dysfunction is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
