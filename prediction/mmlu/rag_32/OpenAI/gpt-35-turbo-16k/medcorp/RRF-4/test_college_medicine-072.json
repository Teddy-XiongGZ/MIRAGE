    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information can be found in Document [0] and Document [4]. According to Document [0], the solid-liquid phase line in the phase diagram of water has a negative slope because ice has a lower density than liquid water. This is further supported by Document [4], which states that ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water. Therefore, the correct answer is C. H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
