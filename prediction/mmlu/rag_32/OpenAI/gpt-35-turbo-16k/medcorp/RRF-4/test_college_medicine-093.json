    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The excerpt discusses the physiological responses to sauna use and the potential benefits of sauna bathing. The next paragraph is likely to provide further evidence or examples to support these claims. Therefore, options A, B, and C are unlikely to be the correct choice. Option D, a study on rats exposed to high levels of heat, is also unlikely as it does not directly relate to the topic of sauna bathing in humans. Therefore, the correct answer is D. A study on rats exposed to high levels of heat.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
