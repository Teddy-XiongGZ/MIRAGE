    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with nonradiating low back pain that started after working in the yard. The pain is associated with bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm and limited range of motion. Straight-leg raising is negative. These findings suggest a musculoskeletal cause of the pain, such as a muscle strain or sprain. The most appropriate next step in management would be analgesia and encouraging regular activity. Bed rest is not recommended as it can lead to deconditioning and prolong the recovery process. X-rays of the spine are not necessary in the absence of red flag symptoms or signs. MRI of the spine is not indicated at this point unless there are red flag symptoms or signs. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Regular activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
