    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with increasing pain in the left foot after femoral-popliteal bypass grafting. On examination, there is a weak popliteal pulse and a cool, pulseless foot. This suggests a possible vascular complication such as graft occlusion or thrombosis. The most appropriate next step would be to perform Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity to assess the patency of the graft and the presence of any thrombus or occlusion. This will provide valuable information about the vascular status of the foot and guide further management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
