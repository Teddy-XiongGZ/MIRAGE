    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a hereditary disorder that affects the ability to repair ultraviolet damage to DNA. The relevant documents mention that XP is caused by mutations in genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), which is responsible for removing UV-induced DNA damage. Specifically, XP patients have defects in the excision repair of pyrimidine dimers, which are formed by the covalent bonding of adjacent pyrimidine bases (thymine or cytosine) in DNA. Therefore, the most likely molecular lesion to accrue in individuals with XP is thymine dimers (choice A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
