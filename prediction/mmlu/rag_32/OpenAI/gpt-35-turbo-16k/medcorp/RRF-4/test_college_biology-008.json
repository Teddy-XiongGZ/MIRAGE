    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The concept of punctuated equilibrium refers to bursts of speciation followed by relatively unchanging lineages. This is described in Document [15] which states that punctuated equilibrium proposes that once a species appears in the fossil record, the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geological history. When significant evolutionary change occurs, it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. This aligns with option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
