    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is true of Systemic Sclerosis, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] states that systemic sclerosis is a generalised connective tissue disorder characterized clinically by thickening and fibrosis of the skin and by the involvement of such internal organs as the kidneys, lungs, heart and gastro-intestinal tract. It also mentions that the prevalence of systemic sclerosis is increased in workers exposed to silica. Document [9] mentions that systemic sclerosis is a rare autoimmune disorder with characteristic cutaneous manifestations and that its prevalence in women is fivefold higher than in men. Document [14] discusses diagnostic criteria, clinical subsets, survival data, clinical evaluation, epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunobiology, genetics, and therapy for systemic sclerosis in adults. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is not A, as systemic sclerosis affects women more than men. It is also not B, as the presence of telangiectasia does not clinch the diagnosis. It is not C, as arachnodactyly is not mentioned as a feature of the disease. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as waxy skin is a characteristic feature of systemic sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
