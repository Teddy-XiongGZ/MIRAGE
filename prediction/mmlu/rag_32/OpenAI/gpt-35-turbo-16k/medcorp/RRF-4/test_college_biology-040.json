    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The larvae of the stem-boring beetle would start eating their way from the center of the twig towards the outside. They would first encounter the pith, which is the central tissue of the twig. Next, they would come across the secondary xylem, which is the wood tissue responsible for water transport. After the secondary xylem, they would reach the primary xylem, which is the older wood tissue. The next tissue they would encounter is the vascular cambium, which is responsible for the production of new xylem and phloem. Following the vascular cambium, they would come across the secondary phloem, which is the tissue responsible for sugar transport. After the secondary phloem, they would reach the primary phloem, which is the older phloem tissue. Finally, they would reach the outermost tissue, which is the cortex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
