    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the mutation in sickle-cell disease is described as a point mutation. Document [3] states that sickle-cell anemia is caused by a single nucleotide change in the beta-globin gene, resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid with valine. Document [8] also mentions that the most common variant of sickle-cell disease is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the gene for the beta chain of hemoglobin. Therefore, the answer is D. a point mutation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
