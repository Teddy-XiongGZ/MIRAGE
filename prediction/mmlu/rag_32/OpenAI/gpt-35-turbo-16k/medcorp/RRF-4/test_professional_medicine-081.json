    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hypothesis is that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. To support this hypothesis, we would expect to see changes in immune markers that indicate a decrease in immune function. Option B, decreased macrophage activity, would be the most likely laboratory finding to support this hypothesis, as macrophages play a key role in immune defense against infections. Options A, C, and D are not directly related to immune function during stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
