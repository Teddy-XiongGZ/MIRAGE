    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether the wings of a bat and the wings of a butterfly are homologous structures or analogous structures, we need to consider their evolutionary origin and similarity in form and function. Bats and butterflies are both flying animals, but they belong to different taxonomic groups. Bats are mammals, while butterflies are insects. Homologous structures are those that have a common evolutionary origin, meaning they are derived from the same structure in a common ancestor. Analogous structures, on the other hand, have a similar form and function but do not share a common evolutionary origin. Given that bats and butterflies belong to different taxonomic groups and have different evolutionary histories, it is more likely that their wings are analogous structures rather than homologous structures. Therefore, the correct answer is B. analogous structures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
