    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation with a blank stare, flat facial expression, catatonia, rigidity, and hostility is consistent with a drug-induced state. Among the options, PCP (phencyclidine) is known to cause these symptoms. Diazepam is a sedative and would not typically cause hostility.
