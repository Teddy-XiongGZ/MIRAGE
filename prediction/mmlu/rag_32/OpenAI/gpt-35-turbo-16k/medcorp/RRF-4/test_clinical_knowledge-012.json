The statement 'Muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5 seconds of intermittent muscle contractions have taken place' is not supported by the documents. Document [31] does not provide any information about muscle lactate accumulation. \\n\\nC. The statement 'Muscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high intensity exercise' is supported by Document [31], which states that muscle phosphocreatine depletion occurs rapidly during high intensity exercise. \\n\\nD. The statement 'With an increasing number of repeated sprints, the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines' is contradicted by Document [31], which states that lactate accumulation increases with repeated high intensity exercise. \\n\\nBased on the provided information, statement D is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
