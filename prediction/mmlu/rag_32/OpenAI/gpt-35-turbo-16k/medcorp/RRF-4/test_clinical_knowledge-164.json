    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, there is no specific mention of the exact range within which the three peak flow readings should be. However, Document [11] mentions that the maximum peak flow from the second set of three blows was a median of 7% greater than that from the first three blows. This suggests that there can be some variation in the peak flow readings between different attempts. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact range within which the three readings should be.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information to determine the range.\"}"
