    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the true statement about a lower motor neuron lesion in the arm, we need to review the relevant information in the documents. Document [3] explains that a lower motor neuron lesion affects nerve fibers traveling from the lower motor neuron(s) in the anterior horn/anterior grey column of the spinal cord, or in the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, to the relevant muscle(s). It is characterized by flaccid paralysis and loss of muscle tone. Document [22] mentions that a lower motor neuron lesion causes decreased control of active movement, particularly slowness, and is associated with decreased reflexes. Based on this information, we can conclude that the true statement about a lower motor neuron lesion in the arm is that the reflexes are decreased, not brisk. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
