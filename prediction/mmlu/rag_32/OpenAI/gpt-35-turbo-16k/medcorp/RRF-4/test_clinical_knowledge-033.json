    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is true of calcium metabolism, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Let's go through each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium: According to Document [4], calcitonin stimulates the incorporation of calcium into bone, which suggests that it would cause a decrease in plasma calcium rather than a rise. Therefore, option A is not true.\\n\\nB. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic: Document [28] mentions that primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which can lead to hypercalcemia. While the document does not explicitly state whether primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic or not, it suggests that it can cause hypercalcemia, which can have symptoms such as oliguria (decreased urine output) as mentioned in option D. Therefore, option B is not true.\\n\\nC. Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands: According to Document [27], the kidney processes vitamin D3 into calcitriol, the active form that promotes the intestinal absorption of calcium. There is no mention of vitamin D being secreted by the parathyroid glands. Therefore, option C is not true.\\n\\nD. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia: Document [30] mentions that hypercalcemia can cause electrolyte disturbances, and oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcemia. Therefore, option D is true.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
