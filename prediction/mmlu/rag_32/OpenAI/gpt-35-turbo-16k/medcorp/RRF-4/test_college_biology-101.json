    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how cyanobacteria differ from green unicellular algae, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [10] states that cyanobacteria are prokaryotes, which means they lack a nucleus. On the other hand, Document [1] mentions that green algae, which are a type of unicellular algae, contain chlorophyll and are plant-like autotrophs. Therefore, we can conclude that cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae differ in terms of the presence of a nucleus. Cyanobacteria lack a nucleus, while green unicellular algae have a nucleus. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
