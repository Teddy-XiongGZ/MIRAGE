    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the experiment involved manipulating the first cleavage plane of an amphibian zygote so that the gray crescent was contained in only one of the two blastomeres. The two blastomeres were then separated. The earlier studies of Roux using frogs showed that inactivating one of the two blastomeres by a heated needle resulted, during the early stages of development, in the formation of a half embryo. In this type of experiment, in which the two blastomeres are not separated, the live blastomere continues its development while it is still attached to an inactivated neighbor. Therefore, the expected fate of the blastomeres in this experiment is that the blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo (Option B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
