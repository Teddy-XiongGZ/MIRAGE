    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely cause of her numbness and tingling in the right ring and small fingers is entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. The patient's symptoms are consistent with ulnar neuropathy, also known as cubital tunnel syndrome. The jolt of severe pain with palpation of the right elbow is a positive Tinel's sign, which is indicative of nerve compression. The decreased sensation over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger corresponds to the distribution of the ulnar nerve. The other potential choices (median nerve at the wrist, musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm, and radial nerve at the forearm) do not match the patient's symptoms and examination findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
