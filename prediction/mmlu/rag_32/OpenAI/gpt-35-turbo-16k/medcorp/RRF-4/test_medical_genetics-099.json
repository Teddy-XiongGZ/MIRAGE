    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which condition is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. Document [5] mentions that Crouzon syndrome is caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene, not FGFR3. Document [4] states that thanatophoric dysplasia is caused by gain-of-function mutations in FGFR3. There is no mention of Waardenburg syndrome in any of the documents. Therefore, the condition that is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3 is D. Waardenburg syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
