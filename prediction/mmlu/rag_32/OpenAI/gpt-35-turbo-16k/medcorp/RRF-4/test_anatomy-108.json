    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the functions of the thoracic cage. To determine the answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the thoracic cage protects vital organs such as the heart, lungs, and great vessels. Document [8] mentions that the rib cage holds the muscles of respiration, which are crucial for active inhalation and forced exhalation. Document [14] explains that the movement of the thoracic cage allows for ventilation and maximal airflow. Based on this information, we can conclude that the thoracic cage is primarily involved in the function of respiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
