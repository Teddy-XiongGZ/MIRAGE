    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is NOT a characteristic of introns, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [20] states that introns are non-coding regions of an RNA transcript or the DNA encoding it that are eliminated by splicing before translation. Document [17] mentions that introns are removed by spliceosomes in nuclear protein-coding genes. Document [15] explains that introns vary in length and density across different species, indicating gain or loss of introns during evolution. Based on this information, we can conclude that the characteristic of introns being found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain (choice C) is NOT a characteristic of introns, as they are non-coding regions and are removed before translation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
