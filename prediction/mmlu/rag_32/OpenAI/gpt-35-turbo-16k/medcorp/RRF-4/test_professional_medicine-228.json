    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with right shoulder pain that started after chopping wood. There are no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced with external rotation against resistance, but there is no weakness. Based on these findings, the most likely tendon involved is the infraspinatus, as it is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder. The other tendons listed (pectoralis, subscapularis, supraspinatus) are not directly involved in external rotation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
