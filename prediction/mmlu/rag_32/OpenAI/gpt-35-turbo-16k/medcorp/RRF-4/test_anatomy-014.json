    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that the growth pattern of the mandible can be determined accurately using serial cephalometric roentgenography in combination with radiopaque implants. Document [2] discusses the surgical advancement of the retrognathic mandible in growing children and mentions that there are severe growth disturbances after surgery, with different responses depending on the amount of surgical correction. Document [5] provides sex-specific reference data for the incremental growth of the mandibular condyle between 6 and 16 years of age. Document [8] describes a method for determining the physiologic equilibrium point of the mandible. Document [12] investigates the effects of operation for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis in early childhood on mandibular growth. Document [13] reviews mandibular morphogenesis and craniofacial malformations. Document [14] examines mandibular sexual dimorphism during adolescence. Document [15] discusses deliberate surgical control of mandibular growth. Document [19] assesses the accuracy of the Schei ruler for measuring alveolar bone loss from radiographs. Document [23] reviews the usage of the term 'mandible' in the anatomical literature on mammals. Document [26] investigates normal and pathologic mandible development. Document [27] discusses implant radiography and the work of Arne Bj\u00f6rk. Document [29] explores the prediction of mandibular growth rotation based on morphologic criteria observed on a single profile radiograph at pubertal age. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and D as they are not supported by the documents. Option C is also not supported by the documents. The correct answer is option B, which is supported by Document [5] that states the condylar growth cartilage ceases activity at puberty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
