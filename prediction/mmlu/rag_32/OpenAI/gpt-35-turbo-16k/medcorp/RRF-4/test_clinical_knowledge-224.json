    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can gather the following information: - Document [2] states that the use of the internet by people aged 65 years and older lags behind other age groups, with only 55.7% of elderly people interviewed using the internet in 2014. - Document [8] mentions that older adults have a greater amount of trust in a person with whom they are able to actively discuss their health, such as health care providers, rather than nonliving sources like the internet. - Document [12] indicates that the consequences of seeking health information online for empowerment are similar for information found via the internet and other sources, and generally positive. - Document [26] reveals that older migrants do not use information and communication technology (ICT) to a great extent to access information in their everyday lives, and many express no interest in learning how to do so. - Document [28] reports that approximately 57% of respondents in Italy use the internet to search for health-related information. - Document [31] shows that 82% of urban older Australians aged 50 to 74 years have internet access and actively use it, with 61% actively seeking health-related information online. Based on this information, we can conclude that option B is the most accurate choice. Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet, indicating that careful consideration should be given to providing alternative information sources for this age group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
