    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which destinations require two different signal peptides for targeting a newly synthesized protein, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions two types of target peptides directing to peroxisome, which are called peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS). Document [2] states that most type I membrane-bound proteins have signal peptides, while the majority of type II and multi-spanning membrane-bound proteins are targeted to the secretory pathway by their first transmembrane domain, which biochemically resembles a signal sequence except that it is not cleaved. Document [5] mentions that the mitochondrial targeting signal, also known as presequence, directs a newly synthesized protein to the mitochondria. Document [6] discusses the signal sequences that target newly synthesized proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the destinations requiring two different signal peptides for targeting a newly synthesized protein are the peroxisome and the mitochondria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
