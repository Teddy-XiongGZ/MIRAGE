    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A competitive inhibitor of an enzyme exerts its effect by competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site. This means that the competitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme at the active site, preventing the substrate from binding. The inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time, as they compete for the active site. Increasing the substrate concentration can overcome the competitive inhibition by out-competing the inhibitor for binding to the active site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
