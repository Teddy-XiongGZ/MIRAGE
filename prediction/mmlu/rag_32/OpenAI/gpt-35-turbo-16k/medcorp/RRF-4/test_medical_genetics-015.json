    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"QTL analysis is a statistical approach for attempting to explain the genetic basis of variation in complex characteristics by linking phenotypic data (trait measurements) and genotypic data (typically molecular markers). It is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross. Therefore, the correct answer is A. identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
