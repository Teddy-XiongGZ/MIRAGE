    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine the answer by analyzing the descriptions of mobile DNA elements. Document [0] mentions that mobile DNA elements, also known as transposable elements (TEs), are genomic sequences capable of moving themselves independently into different parts of the genome. Document [1] further explains that transposable genetic elements, such as transposons, are abundant components in the human genome and can be inserted into intragenic and intergenic regions. Document [3] states that mobile genetic elements can insert into any DNA sequence through transposition mechanisms. Therefore, the correct answer is D. transposons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
