    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of the alleles. Each parent has one copy of each allele (AaBbCc), and during gamete formation, they can produce four different types of gametes: ABC, ABc, AbC, and Abc. When these gametes combine, the resulting genotypes can be AABBCC, AABBCc, AABbCC, AABbCc, AaBBCC, AaBBCc, AaBbCC, or AaBbCc. Out of these eight possible genotypes, only one is AABBCC. Therefore, the frequency of AABBCC individuals would be 1 out of 8, which is equivalent to 1.0/8 or 0.125.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
