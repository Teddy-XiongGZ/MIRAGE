    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the advantages of using adenoviruses for gene therapy, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [4] states that adenoviral vectors possess the tropism of the parental viruses, which infect all cells that possess the appropriate surface receptors, precluding the targeting of specific cell types. Document [8] mentions that adenoviral vectors can transduce cells in vivo with transgenes of more than 30 kb and do not integrate into the host cell genome. Document [14] states that adenoviruses can carry up to 7.5 kb of foreign DNA and infect a relatively broad range of host cells. Based on this information, we can conclude that the advantages of using adenoviruses for gene therapy include: B. low risk of insertional mutagenesis and D. easy assembly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/D\"}"
