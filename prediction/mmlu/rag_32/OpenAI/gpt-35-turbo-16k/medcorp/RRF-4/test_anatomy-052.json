    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The systemic circulation refers to the circulation of blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. It starts with the left ventricle of the heart pumping blood into the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. From the aorta, the blood flows into smaller arteries, then into capillaries where exchange of gases and nutrients occurs. After leaving the capillaries, the blood enters the veins and eventually returns to the heart. Therefore, the correct sequence for the systemic circulation is: Left ventricle \u2192 aorta \u2192 arteries \u2192 capillaries \u2192 veins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
