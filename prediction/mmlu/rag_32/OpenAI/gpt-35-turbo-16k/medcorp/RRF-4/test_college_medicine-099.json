    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The trigger to initiate the contractile process in skeletal muscle is calcium binding to troponin. According to Document [3], the cytoplasmic calcium binds to Troponin C, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin binding site allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament. This is the initial step in the contractile process. Therefore, the correct answer is D. calcium binding to troponin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
