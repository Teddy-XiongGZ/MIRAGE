    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is true of the spine, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [14] provides information about the structure and function of the spine. Document [13] mentions that the spine is a relatively frequent origin of problems in athletes, indicating that back pain is a common complaint. Therefore, option A is not true. Document [28] discusses the radiologic study of the normal spine and mentions Schober's test as a method to measure the flexion of the lumbar spine. This supports option B as true. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine, causing stiffness and fusion of the vertebrae. This condition leads to decreased mobility and increased rigidity of the spine, contradicting option C. Document [24] mentions that the cervical profile can be improved by suturing the platysma muscles, but it does not mention pregnancy as a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine. Therefore, option D is not true. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
