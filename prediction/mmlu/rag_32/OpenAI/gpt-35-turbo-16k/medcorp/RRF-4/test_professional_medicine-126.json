    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with episodes of fainting and fatigue, along with evidence of cannon a waves on physical examination. Cannon a waves are associated with atrioventricular dissociation, where the atria and ventricles are contracting independently. This suggests a high degree of heart block. The ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min and an R-wave rate of 40/min, indicating a complete dissociation between the atrial and ventricular rhythms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is third-degree atrioventricular block (complete heart block).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
