    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of these is not necessary when examining the jugular venous pulse, we need to review the relevant documents and identify the key steps and requirements for examining the jugular venous pulse. The documents mention that the jugular venous pulse can be assessed by visualizing the internal jugular vein, estimating the venous pressure, and observing the pulsations. Good lighting is important for visualizing the jugular vein and assessing the pulsations. The patient's neck muscles should be relaxed to facilitate visualization and palpation of the jugular vein. The patient lying at a 45-degree angle is a recommended position for examining the jugular venous pulse. However, timing the pulsation with the radial pulse is not mentioned as a necessary step or requirement for examining the jugular venous pulse. Therefore, the answer choice that is not necessary when examining the jugular venous pulse is B. Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
