    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 87-year-old woman with progressive memory loss and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 23/30, suggesting cognitive impairment. Laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12 and thyroid function tests, are within normal limits, ruling out vitamin B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism as causes of her cognitive decline. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss, which is consistent with age-related brain changes. Given the clinical presentation and normal laboratory findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which is the mainstay of treatment for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Cholinesterase inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
