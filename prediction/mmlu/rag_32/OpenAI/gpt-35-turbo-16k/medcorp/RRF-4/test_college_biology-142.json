    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, early-successional plant communities are characterized by high ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass. This means that these communities have a high rate of biomass production relative to the amount of biomass present at any given time. This is supported by Document [4], which states that early-successional plant species invest in rapid growth and reproduction. Therefore, the correct answer is B. High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
