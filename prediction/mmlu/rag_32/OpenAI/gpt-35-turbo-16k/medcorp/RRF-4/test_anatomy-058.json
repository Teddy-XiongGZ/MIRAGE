    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another neuron. To answer this, we need to find information about the transmission of impulses between neurons. Document [2] mentions that neurons interact at close contact points called synapses. Document [14] also states that axon terminals, which are distal terminations of an axon, are separated from neighboring neurons by a small gap called a synapse. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Synapse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
