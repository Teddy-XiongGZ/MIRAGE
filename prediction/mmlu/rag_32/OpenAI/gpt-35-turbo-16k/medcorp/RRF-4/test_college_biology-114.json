    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype through various mechanisms. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. A different polypeptide is produced: This is a possible mechanism. Mutations can alter the coding sequence of a gene, leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the resulting polypeptide. This can affect the structure and function of the protein, resulting in a new phenotype.\\n\\nB. The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA: This is not a known mechanism of how mutations in DNA result in the expression of a new phenotype. The polarity of tRNA is not directly related to the expression of phenotypes.\\n\\nC. Nucleic acids are methylated: Methylation of nucleic acids can affect gene expression, but it is not the primary mechanism by which mutations in DNA result in the expression of a new phenotype.\\n\\nD. The gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction: This is not a known mechanism of how mutations in DNA result in the expression of a new phenotype. The direction of gene reading (transcription) is determined by the orientation of the DNA strand and the RNA polymerase enzyme.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, option A is the most plausible explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
