    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proprioceptive receptors provide information about body position and movement. To determine the major concentrations of proprioceptive receptors providing information about the position of the TMJ, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [10] mentions that the proprioception of the TMJ is provided by various components, such as the capsule, masticatory muscles, skin receptors, and receptors within the periodontal ligaments. Document [11] states that TMJ has several proprioceptive receptors, including Golgi-Mazzoni and Ruffini receptors, which are found in the parenchyma of the articular disc. Based on this information, the major concentrations of proprioceptive receptors providing information about the position of the TMJ are likely located in the capsule and ligaments of the TMJ and the articular disc of the TMJ. Therefore, the correct answer is A. the capsule and ligaments of the TMJ and the medial pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
