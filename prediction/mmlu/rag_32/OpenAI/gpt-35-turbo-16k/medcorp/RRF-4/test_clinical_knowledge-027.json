    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which features suggest that a crackling sound is more likely due to a pleural friction rub than crackles, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that a pleural friction rub usually has two sounds, one heard on inspiration and the second on expiration. This suggests that a pleural friction rub may be more prominent in expiration. Document [2] mentions that a pleural rub is difficult to differentiate from fine crackles, but the sound is similar to rubbing your stethoscope against cotton. This suggests that a pleural friction rub may not alter with coughing. Document [6] describes a pleural friction rub as a biphasic sound, heard on both inspiration and expiration, and localized to a small area of the chest. This suggests that a pleural friction rub may not cause pain over the area. None of the documents mention clubbing as a feature of pleural friction rub. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. More prominent in expiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
