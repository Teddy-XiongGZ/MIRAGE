    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) can be calculated as the square root of the incidence in males. In this case, the incidence in males is 1 in 100, so q = sqrt(1/100) = 0.1. The frequency of homozygous recessive females (q^2) can be calculated as q^2 = 0.1^2 = 0.01. The incidence of affected homozygous females is equal to the frequency of homozygous recessive females multiplied by the total population. Since the incidence in males is 1 in 100, the total population is 100 times larger than the male population. Therefore, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females would be 0.01 * 100 = 1 in 1000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
