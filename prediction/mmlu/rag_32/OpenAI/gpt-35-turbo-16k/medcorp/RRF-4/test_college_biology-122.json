    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Low external pH would result in an increase in H+ concentration. This would create a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, with a higher concentration of H+ in the intermembrane space compared to the matrix. This proton gradient is necessary for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, the best explanation for the effect of low external pH is that it increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
