    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information can be found in Document [28]. According to the study, the resynthesis of phosphocreatine (PCr) during recovery normally occurs rapidly. The study also mentions that the resynthesis of PCr only occurs when the blood supply to the muscle is intact. Additionally, the study found that the initial fast phase of PCr resynthesis is limited by the availability of oxygen. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the complete resynthesis of PCr after very high intensity exercise would take longer than 10 seconds but less than 4 minutes. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. about 30 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
