    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is concerned about becoming addicted to narcotics. It is important to address her concerns and provide appropriate information. Option A is not the best choice because it may not fully address the patient's concerns. Option B is not necessary as the patient is not showing signs of opioid overdose. Option C may be a reasonable option, but it does not directly address the patient's concerns about addiction. Option D is not appropriate as lorazepam is not indicated for pain management. Therefore, the most appropriate initial action is to provide education and reassurance to the patient about the low risk of addiction with appropriate use of opioids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
