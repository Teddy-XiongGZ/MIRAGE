    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a healthy 4-year-old girl with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Atrial septal defect (ASD). Atrial septal defect is characterized by a systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. The widely split S2 is also consistent with ASD. Aortic stenosis would typically present with a systolic ejection murmur at the second right interspace, not the upper left sternal border. Coarctation of the aorta would present with a systolic ejection murmur in the back and decreased or delayed femoral pulses. Mitral valve prolapse would present with a late systolic click and a systolic murmur, not a mid-diastolic murmur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
