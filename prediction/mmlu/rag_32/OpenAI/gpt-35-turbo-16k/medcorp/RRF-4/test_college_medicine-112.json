    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Bernoulli's principle, the pressure in a fluid decreases as its velocity increases. In the circulatory system, blood flow velocity is inversely related to the cross-sectional area of the blood vessels. Since the capillary in the neck and the capillary in the knee have equal cross-sectional areas, their blood flow velocities should be equal. Therefore, according to Bernoulli's principle, the pressure in the neck capillary and the knee capillary should also be equal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
