    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences, we need a technique that can detect the interaction between the protein and DNA. Western blot hybridization, Northern blot hybridization, and Southern blot hybridization are techniques used to detect RNA or DNA molecules, not protein-DNA interactions. The correct technique to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences is the Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). This technique involves the separation of protein-DNA complexes from unbound DNA using gel electrophoresis. Therefore, the answer is D. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
