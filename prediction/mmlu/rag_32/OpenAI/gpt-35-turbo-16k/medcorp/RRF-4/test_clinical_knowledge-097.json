    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities is thought to be implicated due to an accumulation of inorganic phosphate. This is supported by the documents that mention the depletion of energy substrates and the accumulation of metabolic by-products, such as hydrogen ions, as key factors responsible for fatigue. None of the other options (B, C, D) are mentioned in the documents as being implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
