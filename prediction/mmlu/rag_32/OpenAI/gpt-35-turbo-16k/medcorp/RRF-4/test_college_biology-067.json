    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a process that occurs in various plant cells during development and differentiation. To determine which plant cell undergoes PCD to become functional, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] states that one of the two long-distance transport systems in vascular plants, xylem, consists of several cell types 'the differentiation of which involves deposition of elaborate cell-wall thickenings and programmed cell-death.' This suggests that xylem vessel members undergo programmed cell death to become functional. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Xylem vessel member.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
