    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the body's cardiovascular system undergoes changes to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients. The heart rate increases to pump more blood to the working muscles. Stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each beat, also increases to meet the increased demand. Systolic blood pressure, which is the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts, typically increases during exercise. Total peripheral resistance, which is the resistance to blood flow in the arteries, may decrease during exercise due to vasodilation in the working muscles. Given that the average pulse for the last 2 minutes of the exercise session is 175/min, it indicates that the heart rate is elevated during exercise. Since stroke volume and systolic blood pressure typically increase during exercise, it is unlikely that they would be decreased. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. Pulse pressure, which is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, may decrease during exercise due to the increased heart rate and decreased diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, the answer is A. Pulse pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
