    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there are several studies that have investigated the effect of stretch duration on flexibility and range of motion. Document [2] found that stretching the hamstring muscles for 30 seconds was as effective as stretching for 1 minute in increasing flexibility. Document [13] examined the effect of different durations of stretching (5 or 15 seconds) on active and passive range of motion and found that both durations resulted in significant improvements in range of motion. Document [10] reviewed the current literature and suggested that one static stretch of 15 to 30 seconds per day is sufficient for most individuals. Considering these findings, the minimum time a stretch should be held for is likely between 5 and 30 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 10-30 seconds.\"}"
