    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how the body compensates for increased environmental temperature, we need to find information about thermoregulation and heat dissipation in the provided documents. Document [4] states that as external temperature and humidity rise, radiation and conduction become ineffective, and evaporative dissipation of heat is the primary means by which the body can cool itself. Document [7] also mentions that in a warm environment, sweat production will start and provide evaporative cooling. Based on this information, the body compensates for increased environmental temperature by increasing water lost through the skin, which is option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
