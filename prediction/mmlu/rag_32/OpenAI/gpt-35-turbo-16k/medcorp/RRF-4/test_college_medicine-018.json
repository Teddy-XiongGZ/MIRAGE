    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"For a very weak base, the pKb value will be higher than the pOH value. The pOH value is a measure of the hydroxide ion concentration in a solution, while the pKb value is a measure of the strength of a base. A higher pKb value indicates a weaker base, which means that the hydroxide ion concentration will be lower and the pOH value will be higher. Therefore, the pKb of a very weak base solution would likely be higher than the pOH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
