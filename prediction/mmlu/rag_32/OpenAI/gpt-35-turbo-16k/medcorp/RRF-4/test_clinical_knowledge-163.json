    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, mutations are errors in DNA that can occur spontaneously at a low rate. Document [0] states that most spontaneously arising mutations result from error-prone replication past a DNA damage in the template strand. Document [1] also mentions that mutants arise by mutations occurring in pre-existing genomes as a result of errors of DNA replication or errors of DNA repair. Document [8] further supports this by stating that spontaneous mutations are one of the four classes of mutations. Therefore, the correct answer is D. occur spontaneously at a low rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
