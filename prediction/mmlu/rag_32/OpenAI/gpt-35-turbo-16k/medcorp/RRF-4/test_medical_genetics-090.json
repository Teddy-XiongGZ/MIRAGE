    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autozygosity mapping is a technique used to map disorders that show autosomal recessive inheritance. This technique is particularly useful for identifying disease genes in consanguineous families, where individuals have inherited two copies of an ancestral allele. By identifying regions of the genome that are autozygous in affected individuals, researchers can narrow down the location of the disease gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Autosomal recessive\"}"
