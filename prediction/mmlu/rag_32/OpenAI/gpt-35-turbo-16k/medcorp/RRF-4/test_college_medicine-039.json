    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of creatine and ATP to phosphocreatine (PCr) and ADP. The activity of creatine kinase is not directly related to intracellular ADP levels, so option A is incorrect. Muscle pH falling below 6.9 is not a direct factor that affects creatine kinase activity, so option B is incorrect. The activity of creatine kinase is not consistently lower in Type II fibers compared to Type I fibers, so option C is incorrect. Endurance training can lead to an increase in the activity of creatine kinase, so option D is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
