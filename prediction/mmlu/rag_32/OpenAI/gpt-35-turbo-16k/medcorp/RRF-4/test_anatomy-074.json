    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the cause of a medially directed strabismus, we need to consider the nerves that control the extraocular muscles responsible for eye movement. The oculomotor nerve (Choice A) controls the medial rectus muscle, which is responsible for inward eye movement. Therefore, damage to the oculomotor nerve could result in a medially directed strabismus. The trochlear nerve (Choice B) controls the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for downward and outward eye movement. The ophthalmic trigeminal nerve (Choice C) and abducens nerve (Choice D) do not directly control the muscles responsible for medially directed eye movement. Therefore, the most likely answer is Choice A, oculomotor nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
