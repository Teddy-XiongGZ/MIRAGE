    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cellular uptake of cholesterol occurs through internalization of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol complexes. This process is known as receptor-mediated endocytosis, where cell-surface receptors bind to the LDL particles and facilitate their internalization into the cell via endosome formation. Adhesion plaques are not directly involved in cholesterol uptake, and therefore can be eliminated as a potential answer. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. adhesion plaques.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
