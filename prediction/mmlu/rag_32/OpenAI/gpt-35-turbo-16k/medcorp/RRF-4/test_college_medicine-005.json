    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria through a process called the carnitine shuttle. Long-chain fatty acids are first activated by esterification with coenzyme A (CoA) to produce a fatty acid-CoA complex. This complex can then cross the external mitochondrial border. Once inside the mitochondria, the fatty acid-CoA is converted to fatty acyl-carnitine by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I). The fatty acyl-carnitine is then transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by a transporter protein called carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. Finally, the carnitine is liberated by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT-II) and transported back outside, allowing the process to occur again. Therefore, the correct answer is D. carnitine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
