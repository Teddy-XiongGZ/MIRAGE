    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is true about a thyroid swelling, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that commonly the subjects in their study were in euthyroid state (90%) and were with firm swellings (66.7%). This suggests that a thyroid swelling may not always elevate on swallowing, so option A is not true. There is no information in the documents suggesting that lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign, so option B is not true. Document [18] mentions that ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) are simple methods of diagnosing thyroid gland swellings, but it does not state that ultrasound is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. Therefore, option C is not true. Finally, document [10] states that radioisotope scanning is an invaluable aid in determining whether a palpable thyroid nodule is benign or malignant. This suggests that a functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer, making option D true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
