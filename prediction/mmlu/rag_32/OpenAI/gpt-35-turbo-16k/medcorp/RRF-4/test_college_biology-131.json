    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement about excretory organs is true, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions the organ of Bojanus, which is an excretory gland found in some molluscs. However, it does not provide information about the osmotic properties of the urine produced by these glands. Document [4] discusses the excretory system of gastropods, mentioning that freshwater species excrete insoluble uric acid to maintain their internal water balance. This suggests that the urine produced by these organisms is hypoosmotic. Document [9] discusses the excretory system of the spider Porrhothele antipodiana, mentioning that dehydration reduces fluid excretion by the anal excretory system and coxal organs. This suggests that the urine produced by these organs is hyperosmotic. Based on this information, the most likely correct statement is D. Juxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
