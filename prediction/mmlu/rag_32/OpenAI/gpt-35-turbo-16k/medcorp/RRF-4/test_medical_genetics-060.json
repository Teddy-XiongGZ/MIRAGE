    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population. Inbreeding increases homozygosity, which means that individuals are more likely to have two copies of the same allele at a given locus. This reduces the frequency of heterozygotes, which are individuals that have two different alleles at a given locus. Therefore, the correct answer is A. reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
