    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To estimate the statistical power of the study, we need to consider the sample size and the effect size. The sample size is given as 200 participants (140 women and 60 men). The effect size is not provided in the question. However, since the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%, we can assume that they are interested in detecting a difference between the two treatments. With a sample size of 200, the study is likely to have a statistical power of at least 40% to detect a meaningful difference between the two treatments. Therefore, the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study is 40%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
