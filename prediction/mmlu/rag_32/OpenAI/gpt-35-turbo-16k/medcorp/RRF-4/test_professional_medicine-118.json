    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient underwent a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, and during the operation, moderate hemorrhaging required ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, the patient has a low calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL, which suggests hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy is commonly caused by damage to the parathyroid glands or their blood supply. The parathyroid glands are responsible for regulating calcium levels in the body. In this case, the parathyroid hormone concentration is elevated at 200 pg/mL, indicating that the parathyroid glands are functioning and producing parathyroid hormone in response to the low calcium levels. Therefore, the low calcium concentration is likely due to damage to the blood supply of the parathyroid glands. The vessels that supply blood to the parathyroid glands include branches of the inferior thyroid artery, which is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Branch of the thyrocervical trunk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
