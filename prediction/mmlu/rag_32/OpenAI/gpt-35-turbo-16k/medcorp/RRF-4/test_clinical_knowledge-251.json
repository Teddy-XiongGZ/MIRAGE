    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the answer by analyzing the characteristics and causes of an intention tremor. An intention tremor is characterized by a broad, coarse, and low frequency (below 5 Hz) tremor that occurs during deliberate and visually-guided movement. It is usually perpendicular to the direction of movement and is associated with dysmetria, where one often overshoots or undershoots the target. The documents also mention that an intention tremor is the result of dysfunction of the cerebellum, particularly in the lateral zone, which controls visually guided movements. Damage or degradation of the cerebellum due to neurodegenerative diseases, trauma, tumor, stroke, or toxicity can cause an intention tremor. Therefore, the correct answer is C. It is indicative of a cerebellar lesion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
