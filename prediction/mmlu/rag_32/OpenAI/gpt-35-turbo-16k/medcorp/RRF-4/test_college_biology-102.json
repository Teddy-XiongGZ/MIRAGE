    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the primary stabilization of the unique coiled structure of an alpha helix in a protein. From the provided documents, it is clear that the stabilization of alpha helices is primarily attributed to hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms. This is supported by multiple documents that mention the importance of hydrogen bonds in stabilizing alpha helices. Therefore, the correct answer is A. hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
