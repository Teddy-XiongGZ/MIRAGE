    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 50-year-old female presenting with chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue. Physical examination reveals multiple bilateral tender points in the trapezius, gluteal, and suboccipital muscle groups. Radiograph findings and laboratory study results are normal. Ankylosing spondylitis is unlikely as it typically presents with inflammatory back pain and stiffness, and radiograph findings may show sacroiliitis. Osteoarthritis is also unlikely as it typically presents with joint pain and radiograph findings may show joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. Myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by localized trigger points and may present with referred pain, but it does not typically involve multiple tender points. The most likely diagnosis in this case is fibromyalgia, which is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, tender points, and fatigue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
