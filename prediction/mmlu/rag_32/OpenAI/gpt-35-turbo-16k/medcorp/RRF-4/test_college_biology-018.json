    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the most accurate description of a retrotransposon. Retrotransposons are classified as class I transposable elements that replicate via an RNA intermediate. This means that they use reverse transcription to convert their RNA genome into DNA, which is then integrated back into the genome. Therefore, the correct answer is C. A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
