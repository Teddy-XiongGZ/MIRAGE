    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation, along with normal physical examination findings and negative endoscopic findings, the most likely diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The first-line treatment for IBS with constipation (IBS-C) is lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion and improves stool consistency. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is lubiprostone (Choice C). Azathioprine (Choice A) and infliximab (Choice B) are used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), not IBS. Mesalamine (Choice D) is used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, another form of IBD, and is not indicated for IBS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
