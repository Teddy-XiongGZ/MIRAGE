    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement about Hirschsprung disease is incorrect, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that Hirschsprung's disease can be associated with Down syndrome, so statement A is correct. Document [14] mentions that the RET proto-oncogene is a major gene associated with Hirschsprung's disease, so statement C is correct. Document [16] states that Hirschsprung disease is more common in boys, so statement B is incorrect. Finally, there is no information in the provided documents about the recurrence risks for long segment disease compared to short segment disease, so we cannot determine the correctness of statement D. Therefore, the incorrect statement is B. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
