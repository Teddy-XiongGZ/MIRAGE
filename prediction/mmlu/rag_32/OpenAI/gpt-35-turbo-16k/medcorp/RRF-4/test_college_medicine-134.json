    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we can refer to Document [4] which states that the composition of transmembrane proteins is different between the cytoplasmic and extracellular sides. Specifically, alanine and arginine residues are preferentially located on the cytoplasmic side, while threonine and cysteine/cystine are preferentially located on the extracellular side. Therefore, based on the given amino acids (glycine, tyrosine, arginine, and isoleucine), the most likely amino acid to be inside the transmembrane domain is D. Isoleucine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
