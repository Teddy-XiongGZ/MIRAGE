Given the patient's remote location and the distance to the nearest dialysis facility, home dialysis may be a more feasible and convenient option for long-term treatment. The patient's eligibility to receive Medicare (choice A) may be important for financial coverage, but it is not the most relevant factor to consider in this case.
