    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the genotype frequencies can be calculated using the equation (2pq), where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. In this case, p = 0.6 and q = 0.4. Substituting these values into the equation, we get (2 * 0.6 * 0.4) = 0.48. Therefore, the genotype frequency of heterozygotes is 0.48.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
