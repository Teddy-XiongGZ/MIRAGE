    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metabolism is determined by the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material. Metabolism involves a series of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes, which are proteins. These enzymes are encoded by genes and their expression is regulated by the genetic material. Therefore, the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material play a crucial role in determining metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
