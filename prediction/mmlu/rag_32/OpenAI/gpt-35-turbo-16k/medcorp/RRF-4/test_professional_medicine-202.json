    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with elevated blood pressure measurements on multiple occasions. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. The physical examination is unremarkable. The next step in management should be to measure urine catecholamine concentrations to evaluate for possible pheochromocytoma, which can cause hypertension in young patients. Other causes of secondary hypertension, such as renal artery stenosis or hyperaldosteronism, should also be considered. Exercise and weight reduction program may be appropriate if the patient is overweight or obese, but further evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension is necessary before initiating lifestyle modifications. Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations is not indicated in this case, as there are no clinical features suggestive of Cushing's syndrome. Captopril therapy is not appropriate as the initial management without further evaluation for the cause of hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
