    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of intermittent shooting pain over the right cheek and jaw, triggered by cold air, chewing, tactile stimulation, and brushing her teeth, are consistent with trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The first-line pharmacotherapy for trigeminal neuralgia is carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant that is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of pain episodes. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate are also anticonvulsants, but they are not considered first-line treatments for trigeminal neuralgia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
