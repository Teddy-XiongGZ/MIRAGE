    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infraorbital nerve block provides analgesia by introducing anesthetic medication in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve. According to the documents, the infraorbital nerve and its branches provide sensory innervation to the lower eyelid, lateral nose, upper lip, and maxillary teeth. Therefore, a successful infraorbital nerve block will produce anesthesia of the maxillary anterior teeth, their labial gingivae, the upper lip, and possibly the anterior hard palate. This is supported by Document [9] which states that the infraorbital nerve and its branches provide sensory innervation to the maxillary teeth, upper lip, and lateral nose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
