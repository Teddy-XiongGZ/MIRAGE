    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which diagnostic technique is of no value for the diagnosis of neural tube defects, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that procedures for prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects include assessment of serum markers such as maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), prenatal ultrasonography, and amniocentesis in selected cases. Document [7] mentions that second trimester ultrasound is recommended as the primary screening tool for neural tube defects, and MSAFP as a secondary screening tool. Document [14] states that MSAFP screening combined with routine ultrasonography has the best detection rate for neural tube defects. Based on this information, it can be concluded that ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic technique for the diagnosis of neural tube defects. Therefore, the diagnostic technique of no value for the diagnosis of neural tube defects is Amniocentesis (Choice A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
