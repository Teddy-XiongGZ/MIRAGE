    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the grams of carbon dioxide produced, we need to balance the equation first. The balanced equation is: C2H4 + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 2H2O. From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of ethane (C2H4) reacts to produce 2 moles of carbon dioxide (CO2). The molar mass of ethane is 30 g/mol, so we can calculate the moles of ethane by dividing the given mass (84g) by the molar mass. Moles of ethane = 84g / 30 g/mol = 2.8 mol. Since the ratio of ethane to carbon dioxide is 1:2, the moles of carbon dioxide produced will be twice the moles of ethane. Moles of carbon dioxide = 2 * 2.8 mol = 5.6 mol. Finally, we can calculate the grams of carbon dioxide by multiplying the moles of carbon dioxide by the molar mass of carbon dioxide (44 g/mol). Grams of carbon dioxide = 5.6 mol * 44 g/mol = 246.4 g. Therefore, the answer is approximately 246.4g, which is closest to option C. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
