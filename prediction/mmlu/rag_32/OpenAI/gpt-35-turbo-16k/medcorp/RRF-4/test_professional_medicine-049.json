    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 46-year-old man with Marfan syndrome, aortic insufficiency, and mitral regurgitation presenting with severe substernal chest pain that is tearing in quality and radiating to the neck. These symptoms are highly suggestive of aortic dissection, which is a known complication of Marfan syndrome. Acute bacterial endocarditis is less likely as it typically presents with fever, new heart murmur, and other systemic symptoms. Acute myocardial infarction is also less likely as the pain in a myocardial infarction is usually described as crushing or pressure-like and may be associated with other symptoms such as shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Esophageal reflux with spasm is unlikely to cause tearing chest pain radiating to the neck. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms is dissection of the aorta.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
