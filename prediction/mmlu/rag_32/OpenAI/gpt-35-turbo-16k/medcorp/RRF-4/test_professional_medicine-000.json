    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh. The decreased sensation is localized to a specific area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Given the patient's history of retroperitoneal hemorrhage and placement of an IVC filter, the most likely cause of her decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. This nerve can be compressed by the hematoma or by the IVC filter itself. Cerebral infarction is unlikely as the patient's symptoms are localized to the left thigh and there are no other neurological deficits. Hematoma of the left thigh would cause more diffuse symptoms and would not explain the specific area of decreased sensation. Therefore, the most likely cause is a complication of the IVC filter placement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
