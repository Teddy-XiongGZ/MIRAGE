    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the true statement about rectal bleeding, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that rectal bleeding refers to bleeding in the rectum and can be caused by various factors such as inflamed hemorrhoids, rectal varices, proctitis, stercal ulcers, and infections. Document [4] states that a detailed history and physical examination are essential to rule out different causes of rectal bleeding, including anal fissure, rectal prolapse, fistulas, inflammatory bowel disease, and neoplasia. Document [7] suggests that proctoscopy can be useful in assessing rectal bleeding, as it mentions that when there is a clear history that the bleeding was perianal, it is likely due to hemorrhoids. Finally, document [11] states that hemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal bleeding in the middle-aged and elderly populations. Based on this information, we can conclude that option A is the true statement, as a painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure, which is a possible cause of rectal bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
