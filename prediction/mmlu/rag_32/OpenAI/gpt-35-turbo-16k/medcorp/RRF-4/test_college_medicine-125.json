    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria is known as chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis is the process by which H+ ions passively diffuse through a specialized channel called ATP synthase, which is embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. This movement of H+ ions down their electrochemical gradient drives the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, resulting in oxidative phosphorylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Passive diffusion\"}"
