    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following statements is true of haematemesis, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Haematemesis is the vomiting of blood and is considered an important sign. Let's go through the options one by one:\\n\\nA. A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features: Document [7] mentions that hypotension and tachycardia are known prognostic factors for adverse events in patients with haematemesis. Therefore, option A is likely to be true.\\n\\nB. A pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring: There is no information in the documents specifically addressing this statement, so we cannot determine its truthfulness.\\n\\nC. Abdominal pain is always present: Document [2] describes a case where a patient presented with severe per oral bleeding but denied haematemesis. This suggests that haematemesis does not always cause abdominal pain. Therefore, option C is likely to be false.\\n\\nD. An alcohol history is not essential: Document [2] mentions that initial investigations for a patient with per oral bleeding focused on excluding an upper gastrointestinal bleed due to multiple risk factors, including previous alcohol dependence. This suggests that an alcohol history can be relevant in the evaluation of haematemesis. Therefore, option D is likely to be false.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, option A is the most likely true statement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
