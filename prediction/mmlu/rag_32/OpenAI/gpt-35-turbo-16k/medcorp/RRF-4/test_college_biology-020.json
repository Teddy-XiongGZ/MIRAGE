    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are known to be effective in facilitating chemical reactions because they lower the activation energy of the reaction. This means that they reduce the energy barrier that reactants must overcome in order to form products. By lowering the activation energy, enzymes increase the rate at which reactants are converted to products. This is the basis of enzymatic catalysis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. They lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
