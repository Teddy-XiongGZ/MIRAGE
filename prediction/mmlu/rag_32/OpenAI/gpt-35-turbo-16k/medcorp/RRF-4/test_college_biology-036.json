    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to refer to the relevant documents and find information about the structure and function of a sarcomere in striated muscle. Let's analyze each statement and see if it is correct or not.\\n\\nA. During contraction H zones become elongated: According to Document [7], the H band in the sarcomere always stays the same length during contraction. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\\n\\nB. In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin: According to Document [30], when muscle contraction ends and the muscle cell relaxes, tropomyosin blocks the binding site on actin, preventing myosin from binding. Therefore, this statement is correct.\\n\\nC. Each myosin helical tail contains an actinbinding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site: There is no specific information in the provided documents to confirm or refute this statement.\\n\\nD. The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively: According to Document [30], tropomyosin is a protein that blocks the binding site on actin, and troponin is a protein complex that regulates the interaction between actin and myosin. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\\n\\nBased on the analysis above, the correct statement is B. In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
