    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During DNA replication, mistakes are coded into the leading strand about once every 100,000/1 million copies. This DNA is subject to proofreading by several mechanisms. If a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed, this would most likely be the work of the mismatch repair mechanism. Mismatch repair proteins correct incorrectly matched nucleotides and excise them before placing the correct nucleotide in their place.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Mismatch repair mechanism\"}"
