    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a process that uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane. Osmosis is the process by which water moves across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration, in order to equalize the concentration on both sides of the membrane. This process does not require any energy input and is driven solely by the concentration gradient. Therefore, the answer is A. Osmosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
