    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the most likely explanation for the therapeutic failure with codeine is decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine. The patient and her family members have experienced poor pain control with codeine, suggesting a common genetic factor. Codeine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme to its active form, morphine. Genetic variations in the CYP2D6 gene can result in decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine, leading to reduced analgesic efficacy. This is supported by the information in Document [2], which suggests that the patient may have had a duplication of the CYP2D6 gene, placing her in the Ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) category, explaining her poor response to codeine use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
