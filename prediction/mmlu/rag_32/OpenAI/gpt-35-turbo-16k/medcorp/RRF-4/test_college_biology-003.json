    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the second messenger that stimulates the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm is inositol triphosphate (IP3). Document [9] mentions that the activated \u03b1 subunit activates phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), resulting in the formation of secondary messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to calcium pumps on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), transporting Ca2+, another second messenger, into the cytoplasm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
