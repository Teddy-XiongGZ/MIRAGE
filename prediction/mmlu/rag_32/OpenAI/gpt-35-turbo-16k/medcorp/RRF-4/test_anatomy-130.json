    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the content of the dorsal roots of all spinal nerves. To answer this, we need to find information about the dorsal roots in the provided documents. Document [1] states that the dorsal root transmits sensory information, forming the afferent sensory root of a spinal nerve. Document [4] mentions that the dorsal root is the afferent sensory root and carries sensory information to the brain. Document [19] explains that the dorsal root is composed of afferent sensory axons that transmit visceral and somatic sensory information from peripheral receptors back to the central nervous system. Based on this information, we can conclude that the dorsal roots of all spinal nerves contain sensory neuronal processes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
