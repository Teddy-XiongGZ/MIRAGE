    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the condition that is NOT required for the Hardy-Weinberg law to operate. The Hardy-Weinberg law states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. The law assumes that genes are not exchanged with other populations (choice A), the population size is large (choice B), and natural selection does not take place (choice C). However, the law specifically requires that matings are random (choice D). Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
