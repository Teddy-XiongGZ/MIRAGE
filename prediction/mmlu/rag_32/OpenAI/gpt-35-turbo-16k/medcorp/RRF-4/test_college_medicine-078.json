    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scientist observes a sharp rise in membrane potential when she first stimulates the neurons, indicating depolarization. However, when she tries another stimulation immediately after the first, there is no response, suggesting that the neurons are in a refractory period. When she increases the amount of voltage for the second shock, she observes a similar response to the first, indicating depolarization again. Therefore, the time period of stimulation for the second shock would be characterized as depolarization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Depolarization\"}"
