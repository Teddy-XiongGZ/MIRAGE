    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the cross between the true breeding lines with dark blue and bright white flowers produces F1 offspring that are light blue. This suggests that the trait for flower color is not a simple dominant-recessive relationship. When the F1 progeny are selfed, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. This is consistent with incomplete dominance, where the heterozygous genotype (light blue) exhibits an intermediate phenotype between the two homozygous genotypes (dark blue and white). Therefore, the correct answer is B. incomplete dominance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
