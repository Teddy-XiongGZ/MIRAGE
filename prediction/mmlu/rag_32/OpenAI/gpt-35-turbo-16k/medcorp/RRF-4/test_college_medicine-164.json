    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the question, the starting velocity of water from the fire hydrant is 2 m/s. The pressure is kept constant, and the end of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the start of the hose. According to the principle of conservation of mass, the product of velocity and area should remain constant. Therefore, if the area decreases by a factor of 3, the velocity should increase by a factor of 3. So, the final velocity of water as it exits the nozzle would be 2 m/s * 3 = 6 m/s.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 6 m/s\"}"
