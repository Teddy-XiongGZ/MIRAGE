    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given information, the patient presents with foot drop on the right side after being hit from behind below the right knee while playing football. Gait analysis reveals a lack of fluid motion, and standing flexion test results are negative. The cruciate and collateral knee ligaments appear intact. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a posteriorly deviated fibular head. Foot drop is often associated with peroneal nerve injury, and a posteriorly deviated fibular head can compress the peroneal nerve, leading to foot drop. The other options (anteriorly deviated distal femur, plantar flexed cuboid, and unilateral sacral shear) are not consistent with the given information and are less likely to cause foot drop.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
