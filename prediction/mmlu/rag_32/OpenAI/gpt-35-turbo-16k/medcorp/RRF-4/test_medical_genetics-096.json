    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which condition is associated with a high blood ammonia level, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that liver dysfunction, such as that seen in cirrhosis, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Document [7] also mentions that defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as ornithine transcarbamylase, lead to hyperammonemia. Based on this information, we can conclude that C. ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is associated with a high blood ammonia level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
