    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oxygen is used in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle). This cycle is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria of cells and is involved in the production of energy through the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Oxygen is required as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, which is part of the Krebs' cycle. This allows for the production of ATP, the main energy currency of cells. Therefore, the correct answer is C. in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
