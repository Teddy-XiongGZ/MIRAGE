    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent desiccation and injury, the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates are encased within a fluid secreted by the amnion. The amnion is an extraembryonic membrane that surrounds the embryo and helps to transport oxygen into the egg and expel carbon dioxide. It also aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The chorion, on the other hand, is another extraembryonic membrane that surrounds the amnion and helps to protect the embryo from desiccation. The allantois is also an extraembryonic membrane, but its main function is to collect metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The yolk sac, on the other hand, surrounds the yolk and contains protein and fat-rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo. Therefore, the correct answer is A. amnion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
