    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has passed a renal calculus composed primarily of calcium. The increased calcium excretion in the urine suggests a metabolic abnormality that is contributing to stone formation. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a medication that can help reduce calcium excretion. Options A, B, and D are not specific to reducing calcium excretion. Option C, a Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor, such as thiazide diuretics, can reduce calcium excretion and is commonly used in the treatment of hypercalciuria, which is a risk factor for calcium stone formation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
