    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine why a bladder washout would be needed for a patient at home, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that bladder washouts are performed to prevent build up of mucus and debris that can lead to urinary tract infection and increase the chance of a bladder stone. Document [3] mentions that incomplete emptying of the bladder can lead to symptoms such as frequency, urge incontinence, and urinary tract infection. Document [6] discusses the use of washout regimens to prevent catheter blockage. Based on this information, it can be inferred that a bladder washout would be needed for a patient at home when the catheter is blocked, as this can lead to incomplete emptying of the bladder and increase the risk of urinary tract infection. Therefore, the correct answer is B. When the catheter is blocked.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
