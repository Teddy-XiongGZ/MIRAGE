    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this cross, the genotype of the tall violet plant is DDWw and the genotype of the dwarf white plant is ddww. When these two plants are crossed, the possible gametes that can be produced are DW and dw. Therefore, the possible genotypes of the progeny are DDWW, DDWw, DdWW, DdWw, ddWW, and ddWw. However, since the alleles for tall plants (D) and violet flower color (W) are completely dominant, the phenotypes of the progeny will be determined by the presence of these dominant alleles. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white, which corresponds to choice C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
