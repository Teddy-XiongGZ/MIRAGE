    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-year-old primigravid woman with an increased MSAFP concentration at 16 weeks' gestation. The next step in management should be to perform ultrasonography. Ultrasonography can help determine the gestational age and identify any fetal abnormalities that may be causing the elevated MSAFP concentration. Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration alone would not provide additional information. Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations is typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation, so it may be considered as an option. However, since the patient already has an increased MSAFP concentration, ultrasonography would be a more appropriate next step. Amniocentesis for measurement of \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration is not indicated at this point, as it is an invasive procedure and should be reserved for cases where there is a high risk of fetal abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
