    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When Mg(OH)2 is dissolved in water, it forms Mg2+ and OH- ions. The addition of HCl will react with the OH- ions to form water, reducing the concentration of OH- ions in the solution. As a result, the equilibrium of the dissolution of Mg(OH)2 will shift towards the formation of more Mg(OH)2, leading to precipitation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Mg(OH)2 precipitates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
