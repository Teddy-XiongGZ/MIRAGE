    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 31-year-old pregnant woman at 32 weeks' gestation presenting with dyspnea, wheezing, coughing up bloodstreaked sputum, and tachycardia. On examination, she has decreased breath sounds at the bases, an irregularly irregular rhythm, and a loud S1. She also has a diastolic rumbling murmur with a preceding snapping sound. These findings are consistent with mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation, which is a known complication of pregnancy. Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of mitral stenosis. Coarctation of the aorta and congenital aortic stenosis are less likely to present with these findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
