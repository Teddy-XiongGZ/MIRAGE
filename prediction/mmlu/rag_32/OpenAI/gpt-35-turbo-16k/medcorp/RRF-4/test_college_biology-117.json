    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best explanation for why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that recent climatic changes have enhanced plant growth in northern mid-latitudes and high latitudes, but the largest increase in net primary production was in tropical ecosystems. Document [2] suggests that the temperature dependence of ecological and evolutionary rates is the most important factor in generating and maintaining high diversity in the tropics. Document [5] indicates that tropical forests are a hotspot of new net primary productivity fueled by new nutrient inputs. Document [7] states that the decrease in seasonality of precipitation over land has led to a decrease in the seasonal variation of precipitation over 62% of terrestrial ecosystems, which could impact vegetation primary productivity. Based on this information, the best explanation for why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics is that the availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis (Choice C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
