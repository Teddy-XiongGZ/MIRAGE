    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine where a stoma should be sited, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that a successful stoma starts with attentive preoperative planning including site marking. Document [1] emphasizes that stoma siting is often regarded as the most important part of preoperative preparation and should be a joint decision made between the patient and the nurse. Document [2] states that ideally, a stoma should be placed within the rectus muscle and below the belt line. Document [5] mentions that the ideal stoma site is located below the umbilicus, within the rectus muscle, away from scars, creases, bony prominences, umbilicus, and belt line. Document [10] mentions that when planning the position of the stoma, a stoma nurse should bear in mind the height of the person's waist and beltline so that clothes can fit as before. Based on this information, the most appropriate answer is A. The rectus sheath abdominus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
