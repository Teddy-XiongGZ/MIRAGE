    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can determine the correct statement about the postnatal growth of the maxilla. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty: There is no information in the documents about the cessation of pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus at puberty.\\n\\nB. Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity: There is no information in the documents about the resorption of the maxillary tuberosity to create space for the eruption of permanent molars.\\n\\nC. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to an increase in height and length of the maxilla: Document [0] mentions that the tensed zygomatic-maxillary suture at the inferior margin of the orbit expands the upper surface of the maxilla, resulting in an increase in width. However, there is no information about the contribution of zygomaticomaxillary sutures to the increase in height and length of the maxilla.\\n\\nD. The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally: Document [7] discusses growth changes in the dental arch, alveolar process, and palate based on dental age and chronological age. It mentions that growth-pattern differences were observed in regions of the tooth used as a dental-age standard, but no growth-pattern differences were observable in regions more than two teeth away from the tooth used as a dental-age standard. However, there is no specific mention of the closure of the intermaxillary suture about eight years postnatally. \\n\\nBased on the available information, none of the provided options can be determined as the correct statement about the postnatal growth of the maxilla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
