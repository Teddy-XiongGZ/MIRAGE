    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Normal somatic cells of a human male are diploid, meaning they contain two copies of each chromosome. This includes the entire genetic information possessed by the original zygote (choice A) and forty-four autosomes (choice C). However, in human males, one of the sex chromosomes, the Y chromosome, is present instead of an X chromosome. Therefore, normal somatic cells of a human male do not have an inactivated X chromosome (choice B). Additionally, since somatic cells are diploid, they have a diploid nucleus (choice D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
