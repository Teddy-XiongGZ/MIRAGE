    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genu varum, or bowlegs, is a common physiological condition in toddlers. It typically resolves on its own without treatment as the child grows. In this case, the child is healthy and the bowlegs are mild (10-degree genu varum). Therefore, the most appropriate management at this time is to recommend no treatment. Surgical correction is not indicated for mild bowlegs, and there is no evidence to support the use of a special exercise program. Increased intake of vitamin D may be beneficial for bone health, but it is not necessary in this case as the child is healthy and the bowlegs are mild.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
