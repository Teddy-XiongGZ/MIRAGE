    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to identify which examples demonstrate the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Symbolic culture involves the use of symbols and shared meanings to communicate and transmit knowledge. In option I, a young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean from an older monkey, even when the food is not covered in dirt or sand, demonstrates the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. The behavior of rinsing off food in the ocean is a learned behavior that is passed down from one generation to another, indicating the use of symbols and shared meanings. In option II, a child learning the rules of baseball from a parent, also demonstrates the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. The rules of baseball are symbolic representations of how the game is played, and they are passed down from one generation to another through teaching and learning. In option III, a new group of inductees in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals from older students, which they then later carry out on new recruits, does not demonstrate the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Hazing rituals are not symbolic representations of any specific knowledge or meaning. They are more related to social dynamics and power structures within the military organization. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is D. II and III only, as option I demonstrates the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
