    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement about exons is correct, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [5] explains that an exon is any part of a gene that will form a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. This means that exons are involved in the coding region of a gene and are transcribed into mRNA. Document [17] provides information on the lengths of introns and exons in various organisms, indicating that exons are part of the coding region. Based on this information, we can conclude that statement B is correct, as the first exon of a protein-coding gene typically contains the translational start site. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
