    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a novel class of drugs that act on androgen receptors. The relevant documents mention that SARMs are intended to have the same kind of effects as androgenic drugs, such as anabolic-androgenic steroids, but be more selective in their action. They are also referred to as tissue-selective androgens. Based on this information, we can conclude that SARMs are non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\"}"
