    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The acceleration of the object can be determined by analyzing the forces acting on it. The forces in play are the gravitational force (mg) acting vertically downward and the frictional force (\u00b5N) acting parallel to the inclined plane. The normal force (N) can be calculated as N = mg cos ?, where ? is the angle of incline. The net force acting on the object in the direction of the incline is given by F_net = mg sin ? - \u00b5N. Using Newton's second law (F = ma), we can equate the net force to the mass of the object (m) multiplied by its acceleration (a). Therefore, mg sin ? - \u00b5N = ma. Substituting N = mg cos ?, we get mg sin ? - \u00b5(mg cos ?) = ma. Simplifying this equation gives a = g (sin ? - \u00b5 cos ?). Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
