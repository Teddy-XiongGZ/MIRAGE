    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Shampoo should not be used for washing the skin when showering or bathing because it can cause dryness of the skin. Shampoo is specifically formulated for cleaning the hair and scalp, not the skin. It contains surfactants and other ingredients that are designed to remove oil and dirt from the hair, but these ingredients can be harsh and drying on the skin. Using shampoo on the skin can strip away the natural oils and disrupt the skin's moisture barrier, leading to dryness and potential irritation. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
