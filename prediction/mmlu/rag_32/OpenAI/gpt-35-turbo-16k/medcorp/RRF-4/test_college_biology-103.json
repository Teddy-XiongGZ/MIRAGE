    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNase digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers involves the cleavage of the linker DNA that connects the nucleosomes. This is supported by Document [2], which states that nucleosomes were treated with exonuclease III (Exo III) and at low levels of Exo III, the heterogeneous distribution of monomers is 'trimmed' down to a discrete core of 140 bp. This 'trimming' of monomers to 140 bp results from a 3' exonucleolytic digestion accompanied by a 5' clipping activity which is specific for the conformation of internucleosomal DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is D. linker DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
