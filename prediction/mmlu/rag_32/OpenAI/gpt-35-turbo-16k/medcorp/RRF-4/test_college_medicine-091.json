    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of covalent bonds that link the amino acids in a protein. Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms. Looking at the relevant documents, Document [2] explains that a peptide bond is an amide type of covalent chemical bond linking two consecutive alpha-amino acids from C1 (carbon number one) of one alpha-amino acid and N2 (nitrogen number two) of another. Document [8] also mentions that amino acids are linked by peptide bonds to form proteins. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Peptide bonds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
