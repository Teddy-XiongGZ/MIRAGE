    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the adaptations of plants to minimize water loss in environments with high temperatures, we can refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions adaptations of the stomata to reduce water loss, such as reduced numbers, sunken pits, and waxy surfaces. Document [7] states that high light intensity, high temperature, low relative humidity, and high wind speed significantly increase plant water loss. Document [13] mentions that plants can adapt to water shortages by minimizing water loss and maximizing water uptake. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Numerous stomata.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
