    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the relative risk, we need to compare the risk of death from the specific type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X with the risk in individuals who do not take Drug X. From the given data, we know that 100 individuals who received Drug X died of the cancer, and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug also died of the same cancer. The total number of individuals who received Drug X is 200, and the total number of individuals who did not receive the drug is 400. Therefore, the risk of death from the cancer in individuals who take Drug X is 100/200 = 0.5, and the risk in individuals who do not take the drug is 100/400 = 0.25. The relative risk is calculated by dividing the risk in individuals who take Drug X by the risk in individuals who do not take the drug: 0.5/0.25 = 2. Therefore, the answer is D. Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
