    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is found unconscious with evidence of rhabdomyolysis (elevated creatine kinase activity, erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs). The positive urine toxicology screening for opiates and cocaine suggests drug abuse. The strongly positive urine dipstick for blood and the presence of pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes on microscopic examination of the urine indicate myoglobinuria and hematuria, which are common findings in rhabdomyolysis.
