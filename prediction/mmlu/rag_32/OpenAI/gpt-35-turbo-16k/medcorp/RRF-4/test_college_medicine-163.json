    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effect of an increasing number of sprints, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] states that for repeated-sprint sessions of 3 sprints, there is a high increase in blood lactate concentration, which remains unchanged for 4 and 5 sprints. After 9 and 10 sprints, blood lactate concentration further increases. This suggests that as the number of sprints increases, there is an increasing anaerobic contribution, as indicated by the rise in blood lactate concentration. Therefore, the correct answer is A. anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
