    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gas exchange in the lungs occurs between the alveoli and the capillaries. The alveoli are the primary site of gas exchange, where oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled.
