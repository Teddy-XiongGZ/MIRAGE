    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the perceived frequency of the gunshot picked up by the camera, we need to consider the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave as observed by an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In this case, the camera is moving towards the source (the actor inside the car), so the frequency will be higher than the actual frequency of the gunshot. First, we need to calculate the relative velocity between the camera and the actor's car. The relative velocity is the difference between the velocities of the camera and the car. The velocity of the camera = 72 km/h The velocity of the car = 108 km/h Relative velocity = Velocity of the camera - Velocity of the car Relative velocity = 72 km/h - 108 km/h Relative velocity = -36 km/h Since the relative velocity is negative, it means that the camera is moving towards the car. Next, we can use the formula for the Doppler effect to calculate the perceived frequency: Perceived frequency = Actual frequency * (Speed of sound + Relative velocity) / Speed of sound The speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second. Perceived frequency = 800 Hz * (343 m/s - 36 km/h) / 343 m/s Converting km/h to m/s: 36 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 10 m/s Perceived frequency = 800 Hz * (343 m/s - 10 m/s) / 343 m/s Calculating the perceived frequency: Perceived frequency = 800 Hz * (333 m/s) / 343 m/s Perceived frequency = 774.9 Hz Therefore, the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at is approximately 775 Hz.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 787 Hz\"}"
