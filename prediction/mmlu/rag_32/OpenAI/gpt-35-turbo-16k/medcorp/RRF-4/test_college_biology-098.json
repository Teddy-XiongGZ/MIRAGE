    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polytene chromosomes are formed through a process called endomitosis, which involves repeated rounds of DNA replication without cytoplasmic division. This results in the formation of many longitudinal strands called chromonemata, giving rise to the characteristic \"many stranded\" appearance of polytene chromosomes. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Polytene chromosomes are produced by repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
