    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the inner membrane of the mitochondrion contains proteins with three types of functions: 1) those that perform the electron transport chain redox reactions, 2) ATP synthase, which generates ATP in the matrix, and 3) specific transport proteins that regulate metabolite passage into and out of the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, the correct answer is B. the components of the electron transport chain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
