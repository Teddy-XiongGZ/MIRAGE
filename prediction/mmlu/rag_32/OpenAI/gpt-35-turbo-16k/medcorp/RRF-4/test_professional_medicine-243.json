    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's recent surgery and risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), prophylaxis is indicated. The most appropriate prophylactic regimen for this patient is subcutaneous enoxaparin. This is the preferred method of prophylaxis for patients undergoing total knee replacement, as it has been shown to be more effective than other options such as heparin or warfarin. Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices can be used as an adjunct to pharmacologic prophylaxis, but it is not the primary choice.

Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin is not the preferred method of prophylaxis for total knee replacement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
