    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a ventricular septal defect (VSD), there is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. This allows blood to flow from the left ventricle (which contains oxygenated blood) to the right ventricle (which contains deoxygenated blood). As a result, the percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be higher.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
