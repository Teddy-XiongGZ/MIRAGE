    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In glycolysis, there is a net production of 2 ATP molecules through substrate-level phosphorylation. This occurs during the payoff phase of glycolysis, where 1 ATP is produced by the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, and another ATP is produced by the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. The question asks specifically about the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis, so we do not need to consider the production of ATP from glycogen. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
