    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Marine birds drink seawater, which is hyperosmotic to their tissues. To maintain their tissue osmolarity at a constant level that is hypoosmotic to seawater, they need to excrete excess salts and maintain water balance. Option A is incorrect because it suggests that marine birds produce large volumes of dilute urine, which would not help in maintaining their tissue osmolarity. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that marine birds produce large volumes of concentrated urine, which would not help in maintaining their tissue osmolarity. Option D is incorrect because nasal glands are not involved in excreting salts and nitrogenous wastes. The correct answer is option C, as marine birds excrete salts through specialized salt-exchange glands and excrete small volumes of urine to maintain their tissue osmolarity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
