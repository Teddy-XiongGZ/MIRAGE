    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, certain ultrasound findings can raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality. These findings are referred to as 'soft markers' and can increase the background risk of chromosomal abnormalities. The documents mention that major malformations or hard markers, when single or in combination, should raise suspicion for a specific syndrome. However, more subtle findings, known as soft markers, can also increase the background risk based on maternal age, especially for Down syndrome. Therefore, the answer choice that would not raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality would be the one that is not mentioned as a soft marker or a major malformation. Let's analyze the answer choices: A. Duodenal atresia is mentioned as an anomaly that is frequently associated with abnormal chromosome counts and is considered an urgent indication for prenatal chromosome analysis. Therefore, it would raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality. B. Holoprosencephaly is not specifically mentioned in the documents, but it is a major malformation and can be associated with chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, it would raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality. C. Hydrops fetalis is mentioned as an anomaly that is frequently associated with abnormal chromosome counts and is considered an urgent indication for prenatal chromosome analysis. Therefore, it would raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality. D. Monozygotic twins are not mentioned as an ultrasound finding that raises suspicion of a chromosome abnormality. Therefore, this would be the answer choice that would not raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
