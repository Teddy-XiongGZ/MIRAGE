    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the efferent arteriole is constricted, it increases the resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus, leading to an increase in hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus. This increased hydrostatic pressure will favor filtration and increase the net filtration pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased hydrostatic pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
