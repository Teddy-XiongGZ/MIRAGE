    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The events described in the documents involve the release of proteolytic enzymes to prevent polyspermy in the sea urchin oocyte. The release of these enzymes is triggered by a rise in intracellular free calcium. Based on the information provided, the specific event that involves the release of proteolytic enzymes is the cortical reaction. This reaction is triggered by an increase in calcium and involves the release of cortical granules, which contain proteases among other substances.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
