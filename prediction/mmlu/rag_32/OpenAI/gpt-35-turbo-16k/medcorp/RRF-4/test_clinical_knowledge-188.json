    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis is the enzyme that determines the overall rate of the pathway. According to the documents, the rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis are hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. Hexokinase is the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, which is an important regulatory step. Phosphofructokinase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, another key regulatory step. Pyruvate kinase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, which is the final step of glycolysis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. phosphofructokinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
