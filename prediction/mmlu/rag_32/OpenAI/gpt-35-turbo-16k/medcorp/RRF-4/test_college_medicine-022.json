    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzyme activity can be affected by various factors such as temperature, pH, and the presence of certain metal ions. The relevant documents mention that enzymes are sensitive to changes in physiochemical factors such as pH and temperature (Document [0]). Document [2] also states that enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules, including inhibitors and activators. Additionally, Document [16] mentions that several factors, including temperature, pH, concentration of enzyme, substrate, and products, can affect the activity of enzymes. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
