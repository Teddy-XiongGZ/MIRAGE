    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, clitoral enlargement, and increased serum testosterone concentration. These findings are consistent with hyperandrogenism. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. The most likely diagnosis based on these findings is a Sertoli-Leydig tumor, which is known to produce androgens and can present with virilization symptoms. Granulosa tumor can also present with hyperandrogenism, but it is less likely due to the size of the ovarian mass. Ovarian carcinoid and teratoma are not typically associated with hyperandrogenism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
