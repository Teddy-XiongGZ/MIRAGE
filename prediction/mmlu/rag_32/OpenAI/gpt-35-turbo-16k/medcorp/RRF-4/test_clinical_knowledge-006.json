    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [5] states that diplopia refers to seeing two images and is due either to ocular misalignment in which case it disappears when either eye is occluded or to an optical problem in which case it is termed monocular diplopia and does not disappear with monocular viewing. This means that diplopia can occur even if one eye is covered, so option A is false. Document [28] provides information about the different types of muscle paralysis that can cause diplopia. It states that a fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks downwards, not upwards, so option C is false. Document [29] mentions that diplopia can be caused by various factors and the false image can be either the outer or inner image, depending on the specific case. Therefore, option B is false. Finally, document [6] states that the most frequent cause of binocular diplopia is cranial nerve palsies, especially the sixth cranial nerve, which causes an inward or convergent squint, not a divergent squint. Therefore, option D is false. Based on this information, none of the given options are true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
