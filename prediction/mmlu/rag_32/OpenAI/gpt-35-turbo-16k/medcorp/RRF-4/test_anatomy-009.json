    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary motor cortex is responsible for generating signals to direct the movement of the body. It is part of the frontal lobe and is involved in motor control. Based on the information provided in the documents, the primary motor cortex sends signals to the spinal cord, which then connect to the muscles. The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus and is responsible for executing voluntary movements. The primary motor cortex controls the contralateral side of the body, meaning that it controls the muscles on the opposite side of the body.
