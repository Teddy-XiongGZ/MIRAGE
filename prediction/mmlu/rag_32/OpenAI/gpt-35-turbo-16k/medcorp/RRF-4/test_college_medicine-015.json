    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell, we need to find the power level at which all 30 mice pressed the lever. From the given information, at 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever. This means that at 80% power, not all 30 mice responded. Therefore, the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell is below 80% power. Similarly, at 70% power, only 15 mice pressed the lever, indicating that the absolute threshold is below 70% power as well. However, at 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever, which means that all 30 mice responded. Therefore, the power level corresponding to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell is 60%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
