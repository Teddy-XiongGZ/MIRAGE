    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we can use Boyle's law, which states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure when the temperature is constant. We can set up the equation: P1V1 = P2V2, where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume. Plugging in the given values, we have (200atm)(0.1L) = (1atm)(V2). Solving for V2, we get V2 = (200atm)(0.1L)/(1atm) = 20L. Therefore, the answer is B. 20L.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
