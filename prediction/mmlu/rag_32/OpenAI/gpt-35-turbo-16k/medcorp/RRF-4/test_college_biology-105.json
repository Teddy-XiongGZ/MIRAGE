    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems, and flowers. It is influenced by various environmental factors. High temperature generally increases transpiration rates as it increases the vapor pressure deficit of the air. Low relative humidity also increases transpiration rates as it increases the vapor pressure deficit of the air. Wind can increase transpiration rates by increasing the rate of evaporation from the leaf surface. However, high relative humidity reduces the vapor pressure deficit of the air and therefore decreases transpiration rates. Therefore, the correct answer is B. high relative humidity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
