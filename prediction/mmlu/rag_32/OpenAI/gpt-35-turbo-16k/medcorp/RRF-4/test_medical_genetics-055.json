    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A mutation in the repressor associated with the lac operon of E. coli which prevents binding of the repressor to lactose should result in constitutive expression of the lac operon genes. In the absence of lactose, the repressor normally binds to the operator sequence and inhibits the expression of the lac operon genes. However, if the repressor is unable to bind to lactose due to a mutation, it will not be able to inhibit the expression of the lac operon genes, leading to their constitutive expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
