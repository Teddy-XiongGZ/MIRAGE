    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine in which position a patient lies face down, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] describes the different positions used for spinal anesthesia, including sitting, lateral decubitus, and prone. Document [3] mentions a technique for cataract surgery in which patients unable to lie flat adopt a face-to-face upright seated position. Document [4] discusses the positioning of unconscious head-injured patients, stating that the backrest position with the head of the bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees is the best position for a patient with increased intracranial pressure. Document [5] describes a case series of cataract surgery performed with face-to-face upright seated positioning. Document [6] also describes a technique of phacoemulsification for patients unable to lie flat, using a seated position. Finally, document [21] evaluates the effect of face-down positioning vs support-the-break positioning after macula-involving retinal detachment repair. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that the position in which a patient lies face down is the prone position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
