    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which mutations are associated with male breast cancer, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that mutations of the p53 gene are relatively common in female breast cancer but do not appear to be as frequent in male breast cancer. Document [2] mentions that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are the most important single gene mutations associated with hereditary breast cancer, and BRCA2 mutation is specifically associated with breast carcinoma in males. Document [8] also states that male breast cancer is associated with BRCA2 mutations. Based on this information, we can conclude that male breast cancer is associated with mutations in BRCA2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. BRCA2\"}"
