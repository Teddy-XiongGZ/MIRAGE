    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The neonate is born at 36 weeks' gestation and shows signs of respiratory difficulty, including mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. The chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. These findings are consistent with meconium aspiration syndrome, which occurs when the neonate inhales meconium-stained amniotic fluid into the lungs. This can lead to airway obstruction, inflammation, and chemical pneumonitis, resulting in respiratory distress. Group B streptococcal sepsis is less likely in this case because there are no signs of systemic infection such as fever or hypotension. Respiratory distress syndrome is less likely because the neonate is born at 36 weeks' gestation, which is beyond the typical gestational age for this condition. Transient tachypnea of the newborn is less likely because the neonate's respiratory distress is not transient and is associated with chest retractions and abnormal chest x-ray findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
