    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To confirm the underlying diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this patient, it is important to gather detailed information about the incident and the patient's symptoms. Option B, asking the patient to provide a narrative with a detailed description of the incident and his symptoms, is the most appropriate approach. This will allow the clinician to assess the presence of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, such as exposure to a traumatic event, re-experiencing symptoms, avoidance symptoms, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Administering amobarbital (option A) is not necessary for confirming the diagnosis of PTSD. Hypnosis (option C) may not be reliable in obtaining accurate information about the incident and symptoms. While paying attention to the patient's willingness to make eye contact (option D) may provide some information about his emotional state, it is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of PTSD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
