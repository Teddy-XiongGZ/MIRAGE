    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for the newly identified severe respiratory illness, we need to consider the properties of killed vaccines relative to live vaccines. A. Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence: Killed vaccines are made from inactivated viruses, so there is no risk of the vaccine virus reverting to a virulent form. This property ensures safety. B. Develops more rapid protective immunity: Live vaccines, which contain weakened forms of the virus, often provide more rapid protective immunity compared to killed vaccines. C. Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity: Live vaccines can sometimes provide lifelong immunity with a single dose, whereas killed vaccines may require subsequent boosters to maintain immunity. D. Is most likely to generate mucosal immunity: Live vaccines, especially those administered orally or intranasally, are more likely to generate mucosal immunity, which is important for preventing respiratory infections. Based on these considerations, the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for the newly identified severe respiratory illness is A. Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
