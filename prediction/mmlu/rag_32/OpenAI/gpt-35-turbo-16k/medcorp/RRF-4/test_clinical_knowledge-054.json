    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there are different recommendations for the compression-ventilation ratio during CPR. Document [2] recommends a general compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 for victims of any age. Document [4] states that the chest compressions to ventilation's ratio changes from 30:2 to 15:2 for a child and infant during two-rescuer CPR. Document [9] mentions that compression-only CPR is recommended for adults, while a ratio of 30:2 or 15:2 is recommended for children. Document [12] states that once a patient is intubated, it is unnecessary to perform cycles of compressions and ventilation, and only chest compressions are performed continuously while rescue breaths are given independently via the bag-valve-mask device at a rate of 10 per minute. Based on these recommendations, the most appropriate answer is D. 30:02:00.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
