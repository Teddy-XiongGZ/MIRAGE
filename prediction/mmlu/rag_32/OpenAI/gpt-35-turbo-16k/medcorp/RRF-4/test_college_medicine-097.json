    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which response indicates a higher likelihood of improvement in subsequent exams, we need to consider the factors that are within Tyler's control and can lead to improvement. Option A suggests that Tyler believes the first test is always harder, which does not address his own performance or study habits. Option B suggests that Tyler blames the teacher, which does not take responsibility for his own actions. Option C suggests that Tyler attributes his poor performance to external circumstances that won't be present in the future, which may not lead to addressing his study methods.
