    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maximal dynamic exercise refers to exercise performed at the highest intensity possible. The transition from anaerobic to aerobic energy supply during exercise is typically around 2 minutes. However, the question specifically asks for the period of time when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic. Based on the information provided in the documents, it is reasonable to assume that this transition occurs earlier than 2 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be either A (10 seconds), B (30 seconds), or C (1 minute). To determine the exact answer, we need to review the documents for more specific information about the transition from anaerobic to aerobic energy supply during maximal dynamic exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
