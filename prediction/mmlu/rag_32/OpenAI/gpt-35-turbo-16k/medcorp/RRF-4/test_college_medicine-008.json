    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of translation involves the synthesis of proteins from mRNA. It requires the presence of mRNA, ribosomes, and tRNA. mRNA carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes. Ribosomes are the cellular structures where protein synthesis occurs. tRNA molecules bring the amino acids to the ribosomes, matching them with the codons on the mRNA to assemble the protein. Therefore, the correct answer is A. mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
