    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, when branched chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle. This is supported by Document [0], which states that ammonia production in skeletal muscle involves the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, and alanine. Document [1] also mentions that BCAAs are found to reduce the increase in serum levels of ammonia during exercise by increasing the amount of ammonia used in glutamine synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
