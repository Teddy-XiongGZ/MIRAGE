    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of the greenish discharge from her left nipple is mammary duct ectasia. This condition is characterized by the dilation and inflammation of the milk ducts, which can result in the production of greenish discharge. Breast cancer is less likely in this case as there are no other concerning findings on physical examination. Fibrocystic disease may cause nipple discharge, but it is typically clear or bloody, not green. Pituitary adenoma is not likely to cause green nipple discharge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. mammary duct ectasia\"}"
