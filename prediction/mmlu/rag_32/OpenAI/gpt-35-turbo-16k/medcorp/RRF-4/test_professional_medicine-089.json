    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a 3-month history of acne. She has Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development, indicating normal puberty. The most likely underlying cause of her acne is stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens. Androgens, such as testosterone, are known to increase sebum production and contribute to the development of acne. Estrogen stimulation (choice A) would not be the cause of acne in this patient, as estrogen has a suppressive effect on sebum production. Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone (choice B) and increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands (choice C) are not known to be associated with the development of acne. Therefore, the correct answer is choice D: Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
