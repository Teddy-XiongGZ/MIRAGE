    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity. From the provided documents, it is mentioned that the brain receives signals from sensory receptors that code for the intensity of a stimulus. The intensity of a stimulus is conveyed by the firing patterns of receptors, and the greater the activity in central sensory neurons, the stronger the perceived stimulus. Therefore, the number of action potentials per second is likely to vary with the stimulus intensity. This suggests that the correct answer is C. The number of action potentials per second.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
