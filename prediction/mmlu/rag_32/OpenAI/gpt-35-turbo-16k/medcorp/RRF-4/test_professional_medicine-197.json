    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction and chest pain on exertion, the most likely mechanism by which a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent would improve his symptoms is by decreasing myocardial contractility. \u03b2-blockers reduce the workload on the heart by blocking the effects of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, on \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the heart. This leads to a decrease in heart rate, contractility, and myocardial oxygen demand, which can help alleviate chest pain and improve symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease. The other options (B, C, and D) are not the primary mechanisms by which \u03b2-blockers improve symptoms in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
