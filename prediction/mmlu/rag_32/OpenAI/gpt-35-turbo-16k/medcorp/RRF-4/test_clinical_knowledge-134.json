    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following statements is true about the knee joint, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Let's go through each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. The knee is a ball and socket joint: According to the documents, the knee joint is not described as a ball and socket joint. Document [10] states that the knee is a weight-bearing joint primarily for sagittal plane motion, which indicates that it is not a ball and socket joint. Therefore, statement A is false.\\n\\nB. A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee: Document [12] mentions a case where a patient had a swollen knee, which was later diagnosed as a synovial lipoma. However, there is no specific mention of a baker's cyst being found anterior to the knee in the provided documents. Therefore, we cannot confirm the accuracy of statement B.\\n\\nC. The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion: Document [7] mentions the clinical examination of the knee, but there is no specific mention of the patellar tap being used to demonstrate an effusion. Therefore, we cannot confirm the accuracy of statement C.\\n\\nD. 'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum: Document [10] mentions that the knee joint is involved in movements such as varus and valgus, but there is no specific mention of bilateral genu varum causing a 'knock knee' deformity. Therefore, we cannot confirm the accuracy of statement D.\\n\\nBased on the analysis of the provided documents, we cannot confirm the accuracy of any of the given statements about the knee joint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
