    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, cytochalasin B causes retraction of microspikes, rounding-up of growth cones, and cessation of axon elongation. This suggests that cytochalasin B affects the microfilaments in the microspikes. Since the question asks about the effect of cytochalasin B on the neuron at this stage of development, the most likely answer is that cytochalasin B causes reversible depolymerization of microfilaments in the microspike.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
