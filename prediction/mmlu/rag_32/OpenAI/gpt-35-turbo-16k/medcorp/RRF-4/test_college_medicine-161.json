    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The quantum number l represents the azimuthal quantum number, which determines the shape of the orbital. For l = 2, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number m range from -2 to +2. Each value of m corresponds to an orbital with a different orientation in space. The number of electrons in an orbital is determined by the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that each orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons with opposite spins. Therefore, for l = 2, there are a total of 5 orbitals (m = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2), and each orbital can hold 2 electrons. So, the total number of electrons with l = 2 is 5 x 2 = 10.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
