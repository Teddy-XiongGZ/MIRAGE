    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle through a protein transporter molecule. Document [12] states that the efflux of lactate and hydrogen ions from muscle cells is mediated by the lactate/proton co-transport system found in almost all cell types in the body. This transporter system plays a major role in pH regulation during and after muscle activity. Therefore, the correct answer is C. via a protein transporter molecule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
