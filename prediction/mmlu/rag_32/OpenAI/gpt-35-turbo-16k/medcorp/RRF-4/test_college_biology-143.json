    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem involves the following sequence of cells: companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, and sieve tube. This is supported by the evidence of plasmodesmatal connections between these cell types and the transport of sucrose through the symplast. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, sieve tube.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
