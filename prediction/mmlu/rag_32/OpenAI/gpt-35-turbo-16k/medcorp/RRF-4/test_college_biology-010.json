    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, cleavage symmetry arising from early cell divisions that occur at an oblique angle to the polar axis is known as spiral cleavage. Spiral cleavage is characterized by the first two cell divisions resulting in four macromeres, each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. The subsequent cleavage cycles involve divisions that produce quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole, and the orientation of these divisions alternates between clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole, resulting in a spiral pattern of cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
