    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which physiological characteristic is not important for success in endurance events such as the marathon race, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the physiological demands and responses of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and muscular systems during marathon running. Document [1] highlights the importance of maximal aerobic power and economy in marathon running success. Document [3] mentions that the metabolic demands of marathon running require the development and integration of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems. Document [8] states that the interaction between different energy systems captures the essence of why certain physiological characteristics of marathon runners exist. Document [10] mentions that the VO2Max of elite runners at maximal exercise is almost two times the value of a fit or trained adult at maximal exercise. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles (B) is an important physiological characteristic for success in endurance events such as the marathon race. Therefore, the answer choice that is not important for success in endurance events such as the marathon race is D. Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
