    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In an SDS-PAGE procedure, the SDS serves as a detergent to denature the proteins. The denaturation process involves unfolding the proteins and disrupting the non-covalent bonds, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, that hold the tertiary and primary structure of the protein together. This denaturation allows the proteins to be separated solely on the basis of their length, as the SDS molecules bind to the proteins in a set ratio, approximately one molecule of SDS for every 2 amino acids. The binding of SDS to the proteins also provides all proteins with a uniform negative charge, which allows them to migrate towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. To break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure of the protein together, thereby generating linear fragments that may be sorted on size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
