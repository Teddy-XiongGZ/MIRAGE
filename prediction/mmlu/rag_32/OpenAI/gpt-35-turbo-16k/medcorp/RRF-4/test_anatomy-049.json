    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [6], the 3-3-2 evaluation involves palpating the patient's neck to determine the location of certain landmarks. The first step is to stack three fingers vertically between the midline of the patient's front teeth with their mouth fully opened. The second step is to stack three fingers horizontally between their chin and their hyoid bone. The third step is to stack two fingers between the thyroid cartilage and the floor of their mouth. Based on this information, if you run your finger down the anterior midline of a patient's extended neck from chin to sternal notch, you should be able to palpate, in order, the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and cricoid cartilage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
