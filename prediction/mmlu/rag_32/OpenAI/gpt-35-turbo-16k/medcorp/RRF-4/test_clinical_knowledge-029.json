    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle through a protein transporter molecule. Document [12] states that the efflux of lactate and hydrogen ions from muscle cells is mediated by the lactate/proton co-transport system found in almost all cell types in the body. This transporter system is of major importance for pH regulation in connection with muscle activity. Therefore, the correct answer is C. via a protein transporter molecule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
