    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is transported into the muscle cell through a three-step process. First, glucose is delivered to the muscle. Second, it is transported into the muscle cell by protein transporters called GLUT4. Third, glucose is phosphorylated within the muscle cell by hexokinase. Insulin plays a role in the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane, but it is not required for glucose transport into the muscle cell. Monocarboxylic acid transporters are not involved in glucose transport into the muscle cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
