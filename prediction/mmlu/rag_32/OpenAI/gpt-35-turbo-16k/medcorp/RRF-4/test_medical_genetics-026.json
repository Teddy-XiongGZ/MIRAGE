    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angelman syndrome is caused by disruption of the UBE3A gene, which is located within the 15q11-q13 region of chromosome 15. This disruption can occur through various mechanisms. Maternal UPD 15 (uniparental disomy) refers to the inheritance of two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother and no copy from the father, resulting in the absence of the paternal UBE3A gene. Paternal UPD 15, on the other hand, refers to the inheritance of two copies of chromosome 15 from the father and no copy from the mother, also resulting in the absence of the maternal UBE3A gene. Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15 involves the loss of the UBE3A gene. A mutation in the SNRPN promoter, however, is not directly related to the disruption of the UBE3A gene and would not result in Angelman syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
