    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the process in which pioneer species colonize a bare substrate such as rock, sand, or glacial till is known as primary succession. Primary succession is the initial step of ecological succession after an extreme disturbance, where pioneer species like lichens, algae, and fungi start to colonize the bare substrate and gradually develop soil and other important mechanisms for greater diversity to flourish. As the succession progresses, these pioneer species are dominated and often replaced by plants better adapted to less harsh conditions, such as grasses and shrubs. Therefore, the answer is D. primary succession.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
