    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the lymphoid organ that acts as a reservoir for red blood cells and filters organisms from the blood. To answer this, we need to identify the lymphoid organ that performs these functions. Looking at the relevant documents, we can find information about the spleen.
