    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the situation in which the maternal serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is lower than average, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [21] states that lighter women tend to have higher AFP levels, possibly due to the greater concentration of AFP in their relatively smaller volume of blood. Document [25] mentions that a normally elevated AFP in the fetus or woman can result in abnormally low AFP levels in the maternal serum. Based on this information, we can conclude that the maternal serum level of AFP is lower than average in situations where there is a normally elevated AFP in the fetus or woman. Among the given choices, the only situation that fits this description is D. Twin pregnancies, as twin pregnancies can result in higher AFP levels in the maternal serum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
