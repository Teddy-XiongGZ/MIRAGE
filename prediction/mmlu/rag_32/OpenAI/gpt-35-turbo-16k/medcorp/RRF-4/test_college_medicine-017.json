    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the new enzyme found in the transgenic mice participates in the synthesis of an unknown product using two reactants. It catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group from one reactant to the other reactant. This indicates that the enzyme is involved in a transfer reaction, specifically transferring a nitrogen group. Therefore, the category that this new enzyme would fall under is B. Transferase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
