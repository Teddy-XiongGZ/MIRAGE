    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During muscle contraction, the myosin heads bind to actin and undergo a power stroke, which is fueled by the energy released from ATP hydrolysis. This power stroke is responsible for the sliding of actin filaments and the shortening of the sarcomere. However, in order for the myosin heads to detach from actin and reset for another power stroke, ATP is required. Therefore, the process of myosin-actin detachment requires ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Myosin-actin detachment\"}"
