    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formation of granulation tissue is a part of the wound healing process. It is characterized by the proliferation of fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix components. The increased activity of certain molecules is involved in this process. Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1) is not directly involved in the formation of granulation tissue. P-selectin is involved in the initial stages of inflammation and leukocyte recruitment, but it is not directly involved in the formation of granulation tissue. Stromelysin is a matrix metalloproteinase that degrades extracellular matrix components, but it is not directly involved in the formation of granulation tissue. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor that promotes the formation of new blood vessels, which is an important component of granulation tissue formation. Therefore, the increased activity of VEGF is most likely responsible for the formation of granulation tissue in the patient's wound.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
