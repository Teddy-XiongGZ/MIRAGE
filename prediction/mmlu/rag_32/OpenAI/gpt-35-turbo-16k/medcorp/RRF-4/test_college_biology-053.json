    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we know that ZP3 is the glycoprotein in the zona pellucida that serves as the receptor for sperm and induces the acrosome reaction. Therefore, any experimental observation that involves blocking the interaction between ZP3 and the sperm receptors would be expected to inhibit fertilization. This includes injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 (choice A), incubating sperm with purified ZP3 (choice B), and incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 (choice C). On the other hand, coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, would not be expected to affect the interaction between ZP3 and the sperm receptors, so sperm aggregation on the beads would still occur (choice D). Therefore, the expected observation would be D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
