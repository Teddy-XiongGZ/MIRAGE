    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed symptoms 10 days after receiving rabbit antithymocyte globulin, suggesting an immune-mediated reaction. The symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on the hands and feet. Based on the symptoms and the timing of their onset, the most likely cause is immune complex deposition in tissues. This is supported by the presence of erythema and lymphadenopathy, which are characteristic of serum sickness, an immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. The other options, cytokine secretion by natural killer cells, eosinophil degranulation, and polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation, are less likely to cause the specific symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
