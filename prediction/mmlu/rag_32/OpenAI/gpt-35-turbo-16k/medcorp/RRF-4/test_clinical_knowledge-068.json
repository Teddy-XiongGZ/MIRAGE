    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the relaxation phase of the left ventricle (diastole), the blood continues to flow through the vessels due to the elastic recoil of the arteries. The arteries have the ability to stretch during systole (contraction) and then recoil during diastole, which helps to maintain blood flow. The atria are not contracting during this phase, and the vessels are not contracted. The relaxation of the right ventricle does not directly contribute to the blood flow through the vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
