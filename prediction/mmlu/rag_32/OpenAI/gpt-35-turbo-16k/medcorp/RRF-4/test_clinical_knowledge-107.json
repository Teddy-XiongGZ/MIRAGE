    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine the correct answer by analyzing the characteristics of spastic paraplegia. Spastic paraplegia is characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. It is usually caused by degeneration of the corticospinal tracts. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Multiple Sclerosis can cause this neurological pattern: This statement is incorrect. Multiple sclerosis is a separate neurological condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness and spasticity, but it is not specifically associated with spastic paraplegia.\\n\\nB. Proprioceptive loss is a common feature: This statement is incorrect. Proprioceptive loss, which refers to the loss of the sense of the position and movement of one's own body, is not a common feature of spastic paraplegia. It is more commonly associated with other neurological conditions.\\n\\nC. Coordination in the legs is affected: This statement is correct. Spastic paraplegia can affect coordination in the legs, leading to difficulties with walking and other motor tasks.\\n\\nD. The tone is normal or flaccid: This statement is incorrect. In spastic paraplegia, the tone is increased, resulting in spasticity and stiffness of the muscles.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Coordination in the legs is affected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
