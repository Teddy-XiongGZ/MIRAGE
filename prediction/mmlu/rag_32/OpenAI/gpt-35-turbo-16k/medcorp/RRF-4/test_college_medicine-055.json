    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin is known to promote glucose uptake by muscle cells. Document [0] states that both epinephrine (adrenaline) and contractile activity regulate glycogen use in muscle, but it does not specifically mention glucose uptake. Document [1] mentions that an amino acid mixture increases glucose uptake across perfused rodent hindlimb muscle in the presence of insulin. Document [4] states that exercise increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle through the stimulation of three key steps, one of which is transport across the muscle membrane. Document [14] explains that insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose into muscle cells. None of the documents mention cortisol as promoting glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
