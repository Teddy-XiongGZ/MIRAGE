    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme, independent of substrate binding. This type of inhibition reduces the maximum rate of the reaction (Vmax) without affecting the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate (Km). On the other hand, uncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds only to the enzyme-substrate complex. Increasing the substrate concentration would not have any effect on the impact of a noncompetitive inhibitor, as it binds independently of substrate binding. However, increasing the substrate concentration may decrease the impact of an uncompetitive inhibitor, as more substrate would be available to form the enzyme-substrate complex. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Decreasing impact of uncompetitive inhibitor and increasing impact of noncompetitive inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
