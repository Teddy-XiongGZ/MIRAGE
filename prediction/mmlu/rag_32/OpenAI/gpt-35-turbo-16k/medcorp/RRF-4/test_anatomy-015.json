    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pupillary light reflex is a reflex that controls the diameter of the pupil in response to the intensity of light that falls on the retinal ganglion cells of the retina. The afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is carried in the optic nerve, which senses the incoming light. The efferent limb of the reflex is carried in the oculomotor nerve, which drives the iris muscles that constrict the pupil. Therefore, the correct statement is that the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is carried in the optic nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
