    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tissue in an actively photosynthesizing plant that would have the highest rate of oxygen production is the palisade mesophyll.

The cortex, epidermis, and vascular cambium do not have as high of a concentration of chloroplasts and are not directly involved in photosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
