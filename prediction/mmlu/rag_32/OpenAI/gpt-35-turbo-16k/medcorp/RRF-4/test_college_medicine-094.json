    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle lactate production increases when glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise. Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is broken down to produce energy in the form of ATP. During intense exercise, there is an increased demand for ATP, and glycolysis is activated to meet this demand. As a result, pyruvate is produced from glucose breakdown. However, if the rate of pyruvate utilization in the mitochondria exceeds the rate of pyruvate formation, pyruvate is converted to lactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase. Therefore, muscle lactate production increases when glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
