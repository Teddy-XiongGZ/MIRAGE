    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is true about carpal tunnel syndrome, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [6] states that carpal tunnel syndrome is characterized by tingling, burning, and pain through the course of the median nerve, particularly over the outer fingers and radiating up the arm. This means that the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome affect the lateral three and a half digits, not the medial three and a half digits. Therefore, option C is not true. Document [15] mentions that carpal tunnel syndrome can be caused by rheumatoid arthritis, so option A is true. There is no information in the provided documents to support option B or option D. Therefore, the correct answer is A. It can be caused by rheumatoid arthritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
