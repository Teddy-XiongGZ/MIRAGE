    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-month-old girl who presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that has continued despite administration of rectal diazepam. She subsequently developed respiratory insufficiency with cyanosis and decreased oxygen saturation. The most likely underlying cause of her respiratory insufficiency is medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can cause respiratory depression, especially when given in high doses or in combination with other sedating medications. In this case, the patient received two doses of diazepam, one rectally and one intravenously, which may have resulted in excessive sedation and respiratory depression. The other answer choices (airway occlusion, encephalitis, meningitis) are less likely to cause acute respiratory insufficiency in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
