    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the experiments on song development in birds have shown that when a young male reared in isolation hears only the song of a different bird species, he will develop an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This suggests that the song of his species is not entirely instinctive, as the young male did not develop the typical characteristics without exposure to the song of his own species. However, it also suggests that the song is not entirely learned during development, as the young male did not learn the typical characteristics from the different bird species. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. both instinctive and learned.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
