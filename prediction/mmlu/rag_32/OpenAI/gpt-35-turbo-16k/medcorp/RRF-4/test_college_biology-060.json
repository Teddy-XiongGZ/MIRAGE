    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the origin and formation of the earliest cells is not explicitly mentioned. However, Document [1] mentions that the replication of informational molecules (likely referring to nucleic acids) was necessary for the emergence of life. Document [5] also suggests that proteins were the first informational macromolecules necessary for the emergence of life. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) were the first informational macromolecules to arise in the earliest cells. The plasma membrane is mentioned in Document [1] as a closed lipid surface that was essential for the first self-reproducing cell to arise. The mitochondrion and flagellum are not specifically mentioned in the context of the origin and formation of the earliest cells. Therefore, the most likely component to have arisen first in the formation of the earliest cells is the plasma membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
