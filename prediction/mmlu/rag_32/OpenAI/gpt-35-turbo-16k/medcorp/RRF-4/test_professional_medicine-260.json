    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient has experienced increasingly severe allergic reactions to bee stings. This suggests a potential risk of anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition is to carry self-injectable epinephrine (choice D). Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and can be self-administered in case of a severe allergic reaction. Avoiding areas known to have bees (choice A) and avoiding wearing colorful clothing outside (choice B) may reduce the risk of bee stings but do not address the potential for anaphylaxis. Carrying diphenhydramine tablets (choice C) may provide some relief for mild allergic symptoms but is not sufficient for the treatment of anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
