    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman has a single gene deletion, which means she is a carrier of \u03b1-thalassemia. The man has a two-gene deletion, which means he has \u03b1-thalassemia minor. If the two-gene deletion is in trans, it means one deletion is on the maternal gene and one deletion is on the paternal gene. In this case, there is a 25% chance that each offspring will inherit both deletions and have \u03b1-thalassemia minor. Therefore, the answer is B. 25%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
