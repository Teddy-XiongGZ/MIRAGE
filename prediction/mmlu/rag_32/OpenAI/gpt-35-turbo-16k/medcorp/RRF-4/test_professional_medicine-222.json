    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of anaphylactic response to penicillin and a rash after taking erythromycin, suggesting a possible allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics and macrolides. Therefore, options A (Amoxicillin) and C (Clarithromycin) should be avoided. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cellulitis, which is commonly caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species. Clindamycin (option D) is a suitable choice for empiric therapy in patients with cellulitis who have a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Therefore, the most appropriate antibiotic therapy for this patient is clindamycin (option D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
