    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how often a cannula should be flushed, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that regular flushing of peripheral intravenous cannulae used for intermittent injections with heparin-saline did not significantly reduce complications necessitating cannula removal. Document [3] suggests that intermittent flushing with normal saline can improve cannula patency compared to continuous infusion. Document [11] also supports the use of intermittent flushing for peripheral cannulas. Based on this information, it is recommended to flush a cannula intermittently rather than at fixed time intervals. Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
