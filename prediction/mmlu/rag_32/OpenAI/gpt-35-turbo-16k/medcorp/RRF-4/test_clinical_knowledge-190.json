    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a novel class of drugs that interact with androgen receptors. The relevant documents mention that SARMs are intended to have the same kind of effects as androgenic drugs, such as anabolic-androgenic steroids, but be more selective in their action. They are designed to selectively stimulate the androgen receptors in specific tissues, such as muscle and bone, while minimizing the androgenic effects in other tissues like the prostate gland. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
