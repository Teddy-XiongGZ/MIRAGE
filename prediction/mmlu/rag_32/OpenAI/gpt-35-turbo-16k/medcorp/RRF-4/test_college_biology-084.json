    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the characteristic unique to angiosperms, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that angiosperms have distinguishing characteristics that set them apart from other seed plants, including gymnosperms. Document [1] further explains that angiosperms are characterized by enclosed seeds and reproductive mechanisms that differ from gymnosperms. Document [5] mentions that the characteristic feature of angiosperms is the flower, which ensures fertilization of the ovule and development of fruit containing seeds. Document [8] discusses the contrasting hypotheses regarding the origin of angiosperms and the debate surrounding the flower as a defining characteristic. Based on this information, we can conclude that the characteristic unique to angiosperms is the flower, which is involved in the process of double fertilization. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Double fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
