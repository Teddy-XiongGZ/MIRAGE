    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following statements is true about possible rectal findings, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Let's go through each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. The finding of a palpable median groove in the prostate is an adverse finding: The documents do not provide any information about the adverse nature of a palpable median groove in the prostate. Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false.\\n\\nB. Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour: Document [12] mentions that a rectal exam can be done to assess for masses and internal hemorrhoids. This suggests that impacted feces can be mistaken for a rectal tumor. Therefore, this statement is likely true.\\n\\nC. A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless: The documents do not provide any information about the pain associated with a thrombosed hemorrhoid. Therefore, we cannot determine if this statement is true or false.\\n\\nD. Peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy: The documents do not specifically mention peri-anal warts. However, Document [20] states that anoscopy is a useful adjunct for screening for anorectal pathology. This suggests that peri-anal warts may be visualized during anoscopy rather than proctoscopy. Therefore, this statement is likely false.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, statement B is likely true, while statements A, C, and D cannot be definitively determined. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
