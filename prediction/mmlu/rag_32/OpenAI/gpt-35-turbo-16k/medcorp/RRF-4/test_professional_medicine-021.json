    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a 1-year history of abnormal vaginal bleeding. The bleeding is occurring every 2 weeks and varies in flow from light to heavy with passage of clots. This is suggestive of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), which is a common cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding in reproductive-aged women. However, given the patient's age and the fact that she is sexually active, it is important to rule out endometrial pathology, such as endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is an endometrial biopsy, as it will provide a definitive diagnosis and rule out any underlying pathology.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
