    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA. This is mentioned in multiple documents, including Document [1], which states that hereditary optic neuropathies, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, are caused by mutations in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome. Document [3] also specifically mentions that Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is a genetic, maternally inherited disease caused by point mutations in the mitochondrial genome. Other documents, such as Document [8], Document [16], and Document [20], also support the fact that Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
