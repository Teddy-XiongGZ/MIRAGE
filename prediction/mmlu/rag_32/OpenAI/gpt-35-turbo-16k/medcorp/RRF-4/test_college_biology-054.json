    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Linkage disequilibrium refers to the non-random association of alleles at different loci. It is influenced by various factors. To determine which factor does NOT promote linkage disequilibrium, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] states that linkage disequilibrium is influenced by factors such as selection, genetic recombination rate, mutation rate, genetic drift, system of mating, population structure, and genetic linkage. Document [4] mentions that linkage disequilibrium can exist between alleles at different loci without any genetic linkage between them and independently of whether or not allele frequencies are in equilibrium. Based on this information, we can conclude that random mating does NOT promote linkage disequilibrium, as it implies independent assortment of alleles and reduces the non-random association between alleles at different loci. Therefore, the answer is D. Random mating.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
