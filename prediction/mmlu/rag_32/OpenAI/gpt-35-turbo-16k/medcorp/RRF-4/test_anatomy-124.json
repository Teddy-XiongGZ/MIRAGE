    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the CNS with the cranial nerves and the sacral spinal nerves. According to Document [10], the preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system come from brainstem nuclei and the sacral spinal cord (specifically S2-S4). The cranial nerves carrying parasympathetic functions include the oculomotor nerve (III), facial nerve (VII), glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), and vagus nerve (X). The sacral preganglionic fibers join to form pelvic splanchnic nerves, which act on the pelvic cavity viscera. Therefore, the correct answer is D. sacral spinal nerves.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
