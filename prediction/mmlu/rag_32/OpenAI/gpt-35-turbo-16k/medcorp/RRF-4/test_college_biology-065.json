    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to gather information about the Golgi apparatus from the provided documents. Document [2] states that the Golgi apparatus grabs and processes secretory materials synthesized by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before sorting them to their destination. This suggests that the Golgi apparatus is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. Document [19] mentions that the Golgi apparatus consists of multiple cisternae containing distinct populations of enzymes, indicating that its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another. Document [22] provides evidence for Golgi apparatus-like functions in Entamoeba histolytica, including glycoprotein folding quality control. This suggests that glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into the Golgi apparatus lumen. Based on this information, the correct statement concerning the Golgi apparatus of a eukaryote is: C. Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
