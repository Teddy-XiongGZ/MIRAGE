    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 72-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer metastatic to the liver who is presenting with symptoms of depression. Given her history of major depressive disorder and the recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer, it is important to assess for suicidal ideation as a first step. This is especially important because she appears sad, cries easily, and has a history of depression. Assessing for suicidal ideation will help determine the severity of her depression and the need for immediate intervention. Reassurance alone may not be sufficient in this case, as the patient's symptoms are significant and may require further intervention. Dextroamphetamine therapy is not appropriate in this case, as it is not indicated for the treatment of depression. Increasing the oxycodone dosage may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may not be the most appropriate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
