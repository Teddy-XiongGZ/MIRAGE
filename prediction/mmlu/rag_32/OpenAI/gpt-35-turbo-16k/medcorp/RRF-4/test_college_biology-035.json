    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ferns undergo alternation of generations, which means they have two distinct phases in their life cycle: a diploid sporophyte phase and a haploid gametophyte phase. The sporophyte is the dominant phase and is the visible fern plant that we typically see. It produces spores through meiosis. These spores then germinate and develop into the gametophyte phase, which is a small, independent plant body. The gametophyte produces gametes (sperm and eggs) through mitosis. The gametes then fuse to form a diploid zygote, which grows into a new sporophyte. Therefore, the correct answer is A. dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
