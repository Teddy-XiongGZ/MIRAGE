    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effect of an increasing number of sprints, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] states that for repeated-sprint sessions (RSS) of 3 sprints, there is a high increase in blood lactate concentration (blood [La]), which remains unchanged for RSS of 4 and 5 sprints. However, after RSS9 and RSS10, blood [La] further significantly increases. This suggests that as the number of sprints increases, there is an increase in anaerobic metabolism and blood lactate production. Therefore, the correct answer is A. anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
