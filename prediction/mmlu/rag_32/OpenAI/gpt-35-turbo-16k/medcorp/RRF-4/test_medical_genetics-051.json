    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we know that a restriction enzyme with a target sequence of 4 nucleotides would be expected to cleave DNA on average once every 256 nucleotide pairs (1 in 44). The genome size of the bacteriophage is given as 5,000 bp. To calculate the number of fragments, we divide the genome size by the average cleavage frequency: 5,000 bp / 256 = 19.53. Since we cannot have a fraction of a fragment, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, a restriction enzyme with a 4 base sequence recognition site would be expected to cleave the bacteriophage into about 19 fragments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
