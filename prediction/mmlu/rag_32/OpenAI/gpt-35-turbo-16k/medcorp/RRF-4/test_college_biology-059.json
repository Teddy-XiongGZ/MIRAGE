    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which biological attribute would most likely allow a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that a species that is apparently cosmopolitan might actually have ecological limitations, such as being limited to specific habitats or ranges. Document [2] discusses the geographic distributions of coastal marine species and suggests that human shipping activities can contribute to the cosmopolitan distribution of certain species. Document [8] mentions the existence of globally-distributed species with low dispersal capabilities, which can be explained by human-mediated transport and hidden diversity in the form of unrecognized cryptic species. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the capacity for long-distance dispersal (D) would most likely allow a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution, as it can facilitate the colonization of new areas and overcome ecological limitations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
