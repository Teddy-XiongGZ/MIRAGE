    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no specific mention of the risk of using water for bladder washout in secondary care. However, Document [0] mentions that saline or sterile water is used for bladder washouts, and Document [6] states that smaller volumes of acidic bladder washout solution (50 mL) are as effective as the commonly used 100 mL. Therefore, it is unlikely that using water for bladder washout in secondary care would pose a significant risk. However, without specific information on the use of water for bladder washout in secondary care, it is not possible to definitively determine the risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"No definitive answer can be determined\"}"
