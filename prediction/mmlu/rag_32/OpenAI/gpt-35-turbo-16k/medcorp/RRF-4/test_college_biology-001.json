    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A frameshift mutation is a genetic mutation caused by indels (insertions or deletions) of a number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that is not divisible by three. This means that the mutation occurs when a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene, resulting in a shift in the reading frame of the codons. Therefore, the correct answer is C. a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
