    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the rate of energy expenditure, we need to convert the rate of oxygen consumption from liters per minute to kilojoules per minute. We can use the conversion factor of 20.9 kJ per liter of oxygen consumed. Therefore, the rate of energy expenditure is approximately 2 l/min * 20.9 kJ/l = 41.8 kJ/min. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the answer is approximately 40 kJ/min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 40 kJ/min.\"}"
