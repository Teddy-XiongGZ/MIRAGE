    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To increase the rate at which a gas diffuses between the alveoli of the lung and the blood within a pulmonary capillary, we need to consider the factors that affect diffusion. According to Fick's law of diffusion, the rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the surface area available for diffusion, the partial pressure gradient of the gas, and the solubility of the gas in water. It is inversely proportional to the thickness of the diffusion barrier and the rate of blood flow through the capillary. A. Decreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas would decrease the rate of diffusion, as diffusion occurs down a concentration gradient. Therefore, this choice is incorrect. B. Decreasing the solubility of the gas in water would also decrease the rate of diffusion, as a higher solubility allows for more gas molecules to dissolve and diffuse. Therefore, this choice is incorrect. C. Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion would increase the rate of diffusion, as more surface area allows for more gas molecules to come into contact with the capillary blood. Therefore, this choice is correct. D. Decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary would decrease the rate of diffusion, as a slower flow rate would reduce the contact time between the gas and the blood. Therefore, this choice is incorrect. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
