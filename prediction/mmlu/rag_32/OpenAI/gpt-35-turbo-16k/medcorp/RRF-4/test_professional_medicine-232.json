    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of atopic allergies and asthma. He presents with increased asthma symptoms over the past month, including wheezing and chest tightness. Physical examination reveals scattered rhonchi and wheezes. Peak expiratory flow rate is decreased. The most appropriate management for this patient is initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler. Daily corticosteroid inhalers, such as inhaled corticosteroids, are the mainstay of treatment for persistent asthma. They reduce airway inflammation and help control symptoms. In this patient, who has persistent symptoms despite using his albuterol inhaler, adding a daily corticosteroid inhaler is the next step in management. Chest x-ray is not indicated in this patient with a clear history and physical examination findings consistent with asthma exacerbation. Fexofenadine therapy is an antihistamine and would not be the first-line treatment for asthma exacerbation. Increased use of the albuterol inhaler is not recommended as it only provides short-term relief and does not address the underlying inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
