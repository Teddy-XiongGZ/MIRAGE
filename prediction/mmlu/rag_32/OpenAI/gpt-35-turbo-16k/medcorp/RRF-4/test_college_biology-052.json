    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the incorrect statement about plant embryogenesis. Let's analyze each statement:\\n\\nA. The suspensor is derived from the basal cell. This statement is correct. The suspensor, which provides nutrients to the developing embryo, is derived from the basal cell.\\n\\nB. Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell. This statement is correct. The apical cell gives rise to the cotyledons, which are embryonic leaves.\\n\\nC. Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation. This statement is incorrect. Shoot apical meristem formation occurs during embryogenesis, not after seed formation.\\n\\nD. Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis. This statement is correct. During embryogenesis, precursors of all three plant tissue systems (epidermis, ground tissue, and vascular tissue) are formed.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the incorrect statement is C. Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
