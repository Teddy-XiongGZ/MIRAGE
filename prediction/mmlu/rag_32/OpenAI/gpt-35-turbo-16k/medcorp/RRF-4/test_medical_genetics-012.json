    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the relative with the greatest recurrence risk in schizophrenia. To determine this, we need to examine the information in the relevant documents regarding the familial aggregation and recurrence risks in schizophrenia. Document [0] states that risks in relatives of schizophrenia patients are many times greater than the general population risk. Document [2] provides recurrence risk estimates for all relative types and confirms the accepted estimates of recurrence risks for schizophrenia. Document [9] further examines how age at onset and parental characteristics modify the familiality in schizophrenia. Based on this information, we can conclude that the relative with the greatest recurrence risk in schizophrenia is the sibling (brother or sister) of an affected individual. Therefore, the answer is A. Brother.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
