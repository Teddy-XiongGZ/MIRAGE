    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention that the submandibular lymph nodes drain the oral cavity and some of the soft tissue structures of the lower face. Document [1] specifically states that the submandibular nodes drain the tongue, lips, and mouth. Therefore, to look for potential infection sites in the submandibular lymph nodes, we should consider the structures that drain into these nodes. The hard palate, upper lip, upper central incisor, and lower first molar are all part of the oral cavity. However, the documents do not provide specific information about which of these structures directly drain into the submandibular lymph nodes. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the answer based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
