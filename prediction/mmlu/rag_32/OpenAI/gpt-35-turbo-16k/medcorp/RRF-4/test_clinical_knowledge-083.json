    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the amount of dopamine in milligrams that a 65 kg person will receive in an hour, we need to multiply the dose rate (4 micrograms/kg/min) by the person's weight (65 kg) and the duration (60 minutes). First, we convert the dose rate from micrograms to milligrams by dividing by 1000. Then, we multiply the dose rate (in milligrams/kg/min) by the weight (in kg) and the duration (in minutes) to get the total amount of dopamine in milligrams.\", \"answer_choice\": \"156\"}"
