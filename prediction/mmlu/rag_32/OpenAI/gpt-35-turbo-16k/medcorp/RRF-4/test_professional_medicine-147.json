    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has developed leukopenia (low leukocyte count) after chemotherapy, which puts her at risk for infection. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase her leukocyte count is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) such as filgrastim. G-CSF stimulates the production and maturation of neutrophils, which are a type of leukocyte. Darbepoetin is a erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia, dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that suppresses the immune system, and interferon alfa is used to treat certain types of cancer and viral infections, but it is not indicated for increasing leukocyte count.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
