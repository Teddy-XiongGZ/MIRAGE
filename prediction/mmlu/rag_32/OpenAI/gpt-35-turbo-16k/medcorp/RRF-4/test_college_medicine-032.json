    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a sound wave travels from one medium to another, several properties of the wave can change. The velocity of sound is determined by the properties of the medium, such as density and elasticity. When sound waves travel from a less dense medium to a denser medium, the velocity of the sound wave generally decreases. Therefore, the velocity of the sound wave will change when it enters the denser medium. The intensity of a sound wave is the power per unit area and is related to the amplitude of the wave. When a sound wave travels from one medium to another, the intensity of the wave can change depending on factors such as reflection, refraction, and absorption. Therefore, the intensity of the sound wave can also change when it enters the denser medium. The frequency of a sound wave is determined by the source and does not change when the wave travels from one medium to another. The wavelength of a sound wave is inversely proportional to the frequency and the velocity of the wave. Since the frequency and velocity of the wave do not change when it enters the denser medium, the wavelength of the sound wave will also change. Therefore, the answer is D. wavelength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
