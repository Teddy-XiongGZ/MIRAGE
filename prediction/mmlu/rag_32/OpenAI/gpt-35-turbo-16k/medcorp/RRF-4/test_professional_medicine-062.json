    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 2-year-old boy with delayed speech, irritability, resistance to eye contact, and hand flapping. These symptoms are suggestive of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, communication difficulties, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. The cause of ASD is complex and multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. While specific genetic mutations have been associated with ASD, the most common cause is believed to be a combination of multiple genetic variants. Trinucleotide repeat expansions are associated with certain genetic disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome, but they are not typically associated with ASD. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a combination of genetic factors rather than a specific mutation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Trinucleotide repeat expansion\"}"
