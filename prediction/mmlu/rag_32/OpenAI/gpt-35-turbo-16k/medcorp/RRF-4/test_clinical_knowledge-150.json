    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which group of patients should be assessed using an Early Warning Score (EWS), we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the aim of the study was to screen the performance of nine EWS to identify patients at high-risk of premature impairment and to detect ICU admissions, as well as to track mortality in patients with acute neurological conditions. Document [1] mentions that EWS in the prehospital setting appeared useful in predicting clinically important outcomes. Document [2] describes a study protocol comparing an Individual Early Warning Score (I-EWS) with the existing National Early Warning Score (NEWS) algorithm regarding clinical outcomes and use of resources. Document [3] provides a general overview of EWS and their use in determining the degree of illness of a patient. Based on this information, it can be concluded that EWS should be used for any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
