    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When examining a patient with an unfavorable fracture of the body of the mandible, it is important to consider the muscles that may influence the displacement of the fragments. The digastric muscle is responsible for opening the mouth and depressing the mandible, so it is unlikely to cause displacement of the anterior fragment downwards. The lateral pterygoid muscle is involved in protrusion and lateral movements of the mandible, but it is not directly attached to the body of the mandible, so it is unlikely to displace the posterior fragment anteriorly. The temporalis muscle is a powerful muscle that elevates the mandible and is attached to the coronoid process, so it is more likely to displace the anterior fragment backwards. The medial pterygoid muscle is also involved in elevation and protrusion of the mandible, but it is not directly attached to the body of the mandible, so it is unlikely to displace the posterior fragment medially. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. anterior fragment to be displaced backwards by action of the temporalis muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
