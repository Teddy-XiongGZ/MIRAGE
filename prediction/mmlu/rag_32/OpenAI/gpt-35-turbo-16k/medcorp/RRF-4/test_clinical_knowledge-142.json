    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The trigger to initiate the contractile process in skeletal muscle is the binding of calcium to troponin. According to Document [3], cytoplasmic calcium binds to Troponin C, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin binding site, allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament. This initiates the contractile process. Therefore, the correct answer is D. calcium binding to troponin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
