    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After translation, protein structure can be modified through various post-translational modifications. To determine which process is not used to modify protein structure after translation, we need to examine the provided options. \\n\\nA. Lipidation: Lipidation is a post-translational modification that involves the attachment of lipid molecules to proteins. This modification can affect protein localization and function. Therefore, lipidation is a process used to modify protein structure after translation.\\n\\nB. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds: This process refers to elongation during translation, which occurs before protein synthesis is complete. It is not a post-translational modification and does not occur after translation.\\n\\nC. Glycosylation: Glycosylation is a post-translational modification that involves the addition of sugar molecules to proteins. This modification can affect protein stability, localization, and function. Therefore, glycosylation is a process used to modify protein structure after translation.\\n\\nD. Phosphorylation: Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that involves the addition of phosphate groups to proteins. This modification can affect protein activity, stability, and interaction with other molecules. Therefore, phosphorylation is a process used to modify protein structure after translation.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the process that is not used to modify protein structure after translation is B. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
