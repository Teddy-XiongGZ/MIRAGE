    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the 12-hour period of sleep without additional food or drink, the man's serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. This suggests that his body is able to maintain glucose homeostasis without the need for external sources of glucose. The most likely mechanism involved in maintaining his serum glucose concentration is glycogenolysis in the liver.
