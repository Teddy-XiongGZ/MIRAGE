    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cohesion-tension theory explains the ascent of water in the xylem. According to this theory, the evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column, which pulls water from the roots to the leaves. This tension is created by the cohesion of water molecules, which allows them to stick together and form a continuous column of water in the xylem. Therefore, the correct statement about the cohesion-tension theory is that the evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
