    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can determine the answer by analyzing the information related to the structure of DNA and its interaction with proteins. Document [15] mentions that the smallest units of chromatin structure are macromolecular complexes of DNA and histones called nucleosomes. Document [30] also states that nucleosomes are basic units of chromatin structure and consist of 8 histone protein subunits around which DNA is wrapped. Therefore, the correct answer is C. nucleosome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
