    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the accuracy and measurement increments of both mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometers are discussed. Document [1] mentions that manual sphygmomanometers, which include both mercury and aneroid types, are used with a stethoscope and measure blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Document [10] states that the mercury manometer, considered the gold standard, measures the height of a column of mercury, giving an absolute result without need for calibration. Document [18] mentions that aneroid sphygmomanometers have calibration errors of mostly 4 mmHg at pressures above 200 mmHg. Based on this information, it can be inferred that both mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometers measure blood pressure in increments of 2 mmHg, as mentioned in document [21]. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 2 mmHg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
