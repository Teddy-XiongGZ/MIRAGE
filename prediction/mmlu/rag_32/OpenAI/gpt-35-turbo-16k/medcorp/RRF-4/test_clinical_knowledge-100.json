    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the true statement about hypothyroidism, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [1] states that primary hypothyroidism may be clinical, where free T(4) (FT(4)) is decreased and TSH is increased. Document [2] also mentions that primary hypothyroidism is defined as decreased production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland, causing a compensatory increase of TSH. Document [15] confirms that subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by normal serum free thyroxine concentrations with elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. Based on this information, the true statement about hypothyroidism is that it is associated with a raised TSH level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
