    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the process of protein synthesis. Proteins are synthesized based on the information encoded in genes. The process involves transcription, where a gene is transcribed into a primary transcript of mRNA, and translation, where the mRNA is translated into a protein. The primary transcript of mRNA undergoes several modifications, including splicing, before it is translated into a protein. Alternative RNA splicing is a process where different parts of the primary transcript are spliced together in various ways, resulting in different mRNA molecules. These different mRNA molecules can then be translated into different proteins. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
