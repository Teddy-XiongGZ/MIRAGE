    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that polychaetes, which are a type of annelid, have completely segmented bodies. Document [4] mentions that annelids used to be grouped with arthropods under the super-group Articulata, as segmentation is obvious in most members of both phyla. Document [5] supports the idea that annelids and arthropods are each other's closest relatives due to similarities in their segmented body plans. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is A. Annelids and arthropods have segmented bodies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
