    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, dental plaque is more likely to accumulate on surfaces that are not easily accessible and are not effectively cleaned by regular brushing. The documents mention that plaque accumulates on hard non-shedding surfaces such as teeth, dentures, and orthodontic appliances. Plaque formation starts with the attachment of bacteria to the acquired pellicle on the tooth surface. The plaque then grows and matures, leading to oral diseases. The documents also mention that plaque is commonly found between the teeth, on the front of teeth, behind teeth, on chewing surfaces, along the gumline (supragingival), or below the gumline cervical margins (subgingival). Considering this information, the surfaces of the teeth that are more likely to accumulate plaque in a patient with poor oral hygiene would be the surfaces that are harder to reach and clean, such as the lingual surfaces (inside surfaces) of the lower incisors and the palatal surfaces (inside surfaces) of the upper molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
