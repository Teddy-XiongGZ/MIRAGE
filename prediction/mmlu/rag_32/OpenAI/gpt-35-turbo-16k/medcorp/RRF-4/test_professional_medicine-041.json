    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 77-year-old female presenting with a syncopal event while walking. The cardiac examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, heard best at the right upper sternal border with radiation into the neck. Based on these findings, the most likely valvular abnormality causing this episode is aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is characterized by a systolic murmur that is typically heard best at the right upper sternal border and may radiate into the neck. It is commonly associated with syncope, especially during exertion, due to decreased cardiac output. Mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis would not typically cause a systolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal border. Aortic insufficiency would cause a diastolic murmur, not a systolic murmur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
