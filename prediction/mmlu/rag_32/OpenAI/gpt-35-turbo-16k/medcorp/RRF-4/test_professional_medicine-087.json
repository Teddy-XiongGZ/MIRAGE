    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 75-year-old woman with band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back. Physical examination reveals no abdominal tenderness to palpation. Ultrasonography of the gallbladder is normal and serum amylase concentration is within the reference range. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic relapsing pancreatitis. Acalculous cholecystitis would typically present with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, which is not seen in this patient. Diverticulitis of the cecum would present with lower abdominal pain, not the band-like, burning pain described by the patient. Herpes zoster would typically present with a unilateral rash and would not explain the abdominal pain. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Chronic relapsing pancreatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
