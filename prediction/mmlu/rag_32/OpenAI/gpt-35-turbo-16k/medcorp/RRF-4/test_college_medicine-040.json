    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The teacher's reward system involves giving stickers to students who show up on time each day and to students who get above a 90% on three quizzes in a row each week. The observation is that performance on quizzes has increased significantly but tardiness has only decreased slightly. From the given information, it can be inferred that the reward system for showing up on time is a continuous reinforcement schedule, as students receive a sticker every day. On the other hand, the reward system for getting above a 90% on three quizzes in a row is a fixed-ratio schedule, as students have to achieve a specific number of quizzes in order to receive a sticker. Based on this, the best explanation for the teacher's observation is that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to the fixed-ratio schedule (quizzes) than it was to the continuous reinforcement schedule (showing up on time). This is because variable ratio schedules (choice A) and variable interval schedules (choice D) were not mentioned in the given information. Intrinsic motivation (choice B) is not directly addressed in the given information either. Therefore, the answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
