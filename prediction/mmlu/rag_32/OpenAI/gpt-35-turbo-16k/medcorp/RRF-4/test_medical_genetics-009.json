    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exon skipping is a process in which one or more exons are skipped during mRNA splicing, resulting in the production of a truncated but functional protein. Exon skipping is typically associated with mutations that disrupt the reading frame of the gene, such as out-of-frame deletions or insertions. These mutations can lead to severe genetic disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is A. nonsense mutations, as they can result in exon skipping and the production of a partially functional protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
