    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of translation involves the synthesis of proteins from mRNA. It requires the presence of mRNA, ribosomes, and tRNA. mRNA carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes, ribosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, and tRNA brings the amino acids to the ribosomes based on the codons on the mRNA. Therefore, the correct answer is A. mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
