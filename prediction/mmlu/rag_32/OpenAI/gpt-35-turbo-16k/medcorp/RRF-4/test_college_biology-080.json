    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, cancer cells grown in culture are different from normal cells grown in culture. Cancer cells have the ability to divide indefinitely, which is a characteristic of their transformed phenotype. On the other hand, normal cells have a limited lifespan and undergo senescence after a certain number of population doublings. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Cancer cells also do not display contact inhibition, meaning they can continue to divide even if held in suspension, while normal cells require attachment to a surface for growth. This makes option B incorrect. Additionally, both cancer cells and normal cells require a surface or substrate for attachment in order to form an adherent culture, so option C is incorrect. Finally, the documents do not provide information about the specific cell density at which cancer cells and normal cells proliferate, so option D cannot be determined. Therefore, the correct answer is B. do not display contact inhibition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
