    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the two xylem plant cell types that provide support and conduct water and minerals. To answer this, we need to identify the cell types that are involved in water and mineral transport in xylem. From the relevant documents, we can see that tracheids and vessel elements are the two cell types involved in water and mineral conduction in xylem. Tracheids and vessel elements are long, hollow cells that transport water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. Therefore, the correct answer is C. tracheids and vessel elements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
