    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has expressed her wish to die at home and has signed an addendum to her advance directive stating that she would rather die than be intubated again. It is important to respect the patient's autonomy and honor her wishes. Admitting her to the hospital against her wishes would not be appropriate.
