    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the correct order of the bones in the middle finger. Document [6] states that the index finger (which is the second digit) has three phalanges. Document [3] mentions that the fingers each consist of three phalanx bones: proximal, middle, and distal. Therefore, the correct order of the bones in the middle finger is proximal phalanx, middle phalanx, distal phalanx. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Proximal phalynx, middle phalynx, distal phalynx.\"}"
