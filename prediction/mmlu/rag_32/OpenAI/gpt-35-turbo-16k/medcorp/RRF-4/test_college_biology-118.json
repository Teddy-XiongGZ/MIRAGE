    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document (Document [0]) describes an experiment in which mouse cells were artificially fused with human cells to produce hybrid cells (heterokaryons). This experiment provided the first direct evidence that some plasma membrane proteins are mobile in the plane of the membrane. Therefore, the most likely cell culture technique employed to yield these results is producing a heterokaryon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
