    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, fast-twitch fibers are characterized by a higher ATPase activity and a reliance on anaerobic glycolysis for energy transfer. They contract and develop tension at a faster rate compared to slow-twitch fibers. However, there is no specific mention of the number of mitochondria in fast-twitch fibers. Therefore, we cannot determine whether they have a relatively large or small number of mitochondria. The correct answer choice cannot be determined based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
