    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency, we need to consider the factors that affect the shift. The Doppler shift depends on the relative motion between the sound source and the detector. The speed of sound in the medium is a crucial factor in determining the Doppler shift. Additionally, the frequency of the emitted sound is also necessary to calculate the shift. The time of interaction between the sound source and the detector and the distance between the source and the detector are not directly related to the Doppler shift. Therefore, the variables that must be known to determine the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency are the speed of sound in the medium (I) and the frequency of the emitted sound (IV). Hence, the answer is D. I and IV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
