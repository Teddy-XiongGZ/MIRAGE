    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A dental panoramic radiograph is a two-dimensional view of a half-circle from ear to ear, showing structures over a large area in their relative location. The sharpness of detail is much less compared to other types of radiographs, and overlap of structures occurs in different areas of the image. Based on the information provided in the documents, the structures that should be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph are the mandibular canal and maxillary sinus. The hard palate and zygomatic arch may not be clearly visible due to the limitations of panoramic radiography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
