    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metabolism is determined by the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material. The genetic material, which is DNA, contains the instructions for the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are the key molecules involved in metabolic reactions and pathways. They act as enzymes, which catalyze the chemical reactions of metabolism. Therefore, the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material play a crucial role in determining metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
