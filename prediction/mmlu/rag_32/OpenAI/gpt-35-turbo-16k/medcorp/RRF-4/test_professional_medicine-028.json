    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 3-year-old girl has a positive PPD skin test with 10 mm of induration. Given her history of living in a homeless shelter and her parents' history of nonreactive skin tests, it is important to consider the possibility of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The most appropriate next step is to order a chest x-ray to evaluate for active tuberculosis disease. This is because a positive PPD skin test in a child with a low risk of exposure to tuberculosis is more likely to indicate active disease rather than LTBI. Ordering a test for HIV antibody (choice C) may be considered if there are other risk factors for HIV infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Calling her previous physician (choice A) may provide additional history, but it is not necessary for the immediate management of this positive PPD skin test. Repeating the PPD skin test (choice D) is not necessary as the initial test was already positive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
