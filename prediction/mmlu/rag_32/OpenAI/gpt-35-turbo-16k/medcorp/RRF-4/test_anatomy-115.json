    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon typically occurs in the fallopian tube. The fallopian tube is the structure where the released ovum (secondary oocyte) is captured and where fertilization takes place when a spermatozoon successfully enters the ovum. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina and does not play a direct role in fertilization. The ovary is the site of ovum production but fertilization does not occur within the ovary. The uterus is the organ where the fertilized ovum implants and develops into an embryo, but fertilization itself occurs before the ovum reaches the uterus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
