    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with acute onset of rotatory vertigo, imbalance, decreased hearing, tinnitus, and a sense of fullness of the right ear, which are characteristic symptoms of Meniere's disease. The episodes last for 12 hours, which is consistent with the duration of Meniere's disease attacks. The mild hearing loss of the right ear further supports the diagnosis. Acoustic neuroma typically presents with gradual hearing loss and vestibular symptoms, while benign positional vertigo is characterized by brief episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position.
