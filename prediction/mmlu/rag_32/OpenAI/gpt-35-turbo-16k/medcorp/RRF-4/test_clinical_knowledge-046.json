    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the answer by considering the structure and composition of DNA. DNA is composed of nucleotides, which consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous bases in DNA can be classified into two groups: purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine). The base pairing rules state that adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine. This means that the number of purines in a DNA molecule will be equal to the number of pyrimidines. Therefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is always 1:1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. always 1:1.\"}"
