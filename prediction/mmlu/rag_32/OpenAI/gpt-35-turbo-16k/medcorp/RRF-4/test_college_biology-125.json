    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which adaptations would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that 'specific 'anti-bee' adaptations have been important in shaping hummingbird-flowers.' Document [3] states that 'hummingbird pollination is much more efficient in self-incompatible populations because hummingbirds waste less pollen and provide higher outcrossing rates.' Document [9] suggests that 'acquisition of floral traits that resemble those of hummingbird-pollination enables Penstemon plant species to deter bumblebee visits.' Based on this information, it can be inferred that adaptations that limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination include 'anti-bee' adaptations, self-incompatibility, and floral traits that resemble those of hummingbird-pollination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Patterns of ultraviolet color on the petals\"}"
