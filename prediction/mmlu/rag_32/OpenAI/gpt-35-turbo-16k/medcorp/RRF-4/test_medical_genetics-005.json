    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions the need for high resolution maps of all chromosomes for functional analysis and identification of gene sequences. Document [2] discusses the construction of integrated maps at all levels of resolution to facilitate determination of the DNA sequence and gene content of the human genome. Document [3] describes the construction of a genetic map of human chromosome 16. Document [7] mentions the comprehensive physical mapping of chromosome 21. Document [9] discusses the mapping of the human Y chromosome. Based on this information, it can be concluded that mapping of human chromosomes has proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available. Therefore, the answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
