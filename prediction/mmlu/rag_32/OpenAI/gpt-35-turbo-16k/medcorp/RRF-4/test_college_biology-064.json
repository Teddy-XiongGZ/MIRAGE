    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the mammalian cardiac cycle, a volume of blood equivalent to ventricular stroke volume is transferred from the more compliant venous side to the less compliant arterial side of the circulation. This transfer results in an increase in venous pressure and an equal but opposite decrease in arterial pressure. This is because the venous side of the circulation is more compliant, meaning it can expand and accommodate the increased volume of blood, leading to an increase in venous pressure. On the other hand, the arterial side of the circulation is less compliant, so it cannot expand as easily, resulting in a decrease in arterial pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
