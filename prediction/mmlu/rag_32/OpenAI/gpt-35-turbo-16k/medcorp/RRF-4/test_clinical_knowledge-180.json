    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A change in blood pressure is detected by the baroreceptors. Baroreceptors are high-pressure receptors located in the walls of the aortic arch and carotid sinus. They monitor the arterial blood pressure and detect changes in pressure by sensing the stretching of the arterial walls. When the blood pressure increases, the baroreceptors send signals to the cardiovascular center in the brainstem, which then initiates appropriate responses to regulate blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
