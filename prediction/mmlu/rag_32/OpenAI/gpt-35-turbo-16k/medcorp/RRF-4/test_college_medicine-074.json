    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MERRF is caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that is maternally inherited. This means that affected males cannot pass on the disease to their offspring. However, affected females have a 50% chance of passing on the mutated mtDNA to their offspring. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring would depend on the genotype of the mother. If the mother is affected and carries the mutated mtDNA, then half of the males and half of the females will be affected. If the mother is unaffected and does not carry the mutated mtDNA, then none of the offspring will be affected. Therefore, the answer is C. Half of males and half of females will be affected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
