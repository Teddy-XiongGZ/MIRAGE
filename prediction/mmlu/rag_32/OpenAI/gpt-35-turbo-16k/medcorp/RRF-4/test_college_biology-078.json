    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If the activity of an enzyme is constant over a broad range of pH values, it suggests that the enzyme is not sensitive to changes in pH. This means that the ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate are not participating in the reaction, as changes in pH would typically affect the ionization state of these groups and therefore impact enzyme activity. Therefore, the correct answer is C. ionizing groups on both the enzyme and substrate participate in the reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
