    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From an evolutionary perspective, the optimality theory suggests that traits will be favored if they provide a net benefit to the organism. This means that the benefits gained from the trait should exceed the costs associated with the trait. Therefore, the best representation of the optimality theory is option A, which states that if the benefits gained from the trait exceed the cost of the trait to the animal performing them, that trait will persist in the genome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
