    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Surfactant is a lipoprotein complex that lines the alveoli and decreases the surface tension to prevent lung atelectasis. A deficiency of surfactant leads to inadequate production of surfactant, which results in the collapse of the alveoli and compromised oxygen diffusion. Therefore, surfactant plays a role in maintaining alveoli in an open state, which facilitates oxygen diffusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
