    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the coding sequences of genes are called exons. Exons are the segments of DNA or RNA that contain the coding information for the production of proteins. They are the parts of the gene that are transcribed into mRNA and eventually translated into amino acids to form proteins. Introns, on the other hand, are non-coding sequences that are interspersed between exons and are removed during mRNA processing. Codons, on the other hand, are sets of three nucleotides that specify a particular amino acid during translation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. exons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
