    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. The next step in evaluation should be to perform a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule. FNA is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test for evaluating thyroid nodules and can help determine if the nodule is benign or malignant. Other imaging tests such as CT scan or radionuclide thyroid scan may be considered if the FNA results are inconclusive or if there are additional concerning features on physical examination or ultrasound. Thyroidectomy would be reserved for cases where the FNA results indicate malignancy or if there are other high-risk features.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
