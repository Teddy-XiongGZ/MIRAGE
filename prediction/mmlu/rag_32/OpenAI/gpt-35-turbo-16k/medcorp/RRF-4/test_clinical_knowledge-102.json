    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the solution that should be used to complete the bladder washout, we need to consider the relevant information from the documents. Document [20] mentions a study that compared three bladder washout treatments - saline, Suby G, and Solution R. However, it states that there was no significant reduction in crystals in the neutral (saline) washout. Document [30] also mentions a study comparing epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) solution with normal saline for postoperative bladder irrigation, but it does not show a significant advantage of EACA over normal saline. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that normal saline would be an appropriate solution for completing the bladder washout in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
