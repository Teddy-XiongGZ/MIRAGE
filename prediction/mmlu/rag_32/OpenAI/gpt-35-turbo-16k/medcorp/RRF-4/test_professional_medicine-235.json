    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history of intentional self-mutilation and the clinical presentation of a burn with signs of infection (fluctuance, erythema, red streaks, fever), the most appropriate next step would be incision and drainage of the burn sites. This is necessary to remove the purulent material and alleviate the symptoms of infection. Psychiatric consultation may be warranted in the long term, but immediate management should focus on treating the infection. Topical silver sulfadiazine may be used as an adjunctive treatment after incision and drainage, but it is not the primary intervention. Transfer to a burn center may be considered if the infection is severe or if there are complications, but it is not the initial step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
