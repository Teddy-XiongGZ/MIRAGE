    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During cell division, the section of the chromosome that serves as the site of attachment by the mitotic spindle is called the kinetochore. The kinetochore is a protein complex assembled at each centromere, which is a chromosomal locus. The kinetochore attaches to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle and generates forces to power chromosome movement. Therefore, the correct answer is C. kinetochore.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
