    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the estimated number of human protein-coding genes is around 19,000-20,000. Document [1] states that the total number of protein-coding genes was revised down to ~20,000. Document [2] mentions that the Ensembl human protein-coding gene number is 22,184, a decrease of 1862 since the first release. Document [5] also confirms that the count of recognized protein-coding genes dropped to 19,000-20,000. Therefore, the answer choice is B. 19,000\u201320,000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 19,000\u201320,000\"}"
