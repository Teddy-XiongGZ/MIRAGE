    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient and her mother have the same single nucleotide change in the FBN1 gene. However, the patient has clinical features consistent with Marfan syndrome, while the mother does not. Additionally, the same nucleotide change is found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Based on this information, it is most likely that the single nucleotide change is a polymorphism, rather than a disease-causing mutation. Polymorphisms are common genetic variations that are found in a population and do not cause disease. In this case, the single nucleotide change does not change the amino acid at that locus and is also found in individuals without Marfan syndrome, suggesting that it is a benign variant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
