    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Leaching and cycling of nutrients in soils are influenced by factors such as climate, soil properties, and vegetation. From the provided documents, we can gather that the soils in tropical rainforests have a high rate of leaching and cycling of nutrients. Document [0] mentions that the warm and humid climate in tropical rainforests allows for a rapid decomposition rate, leading to nutrients being absorbed by the biota quickly. Additionally, the heavy rainfall in these regions contributes to regular leaching of solutes and minerals from the soil. Therefore, the answer is A. Tropical rain forest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
