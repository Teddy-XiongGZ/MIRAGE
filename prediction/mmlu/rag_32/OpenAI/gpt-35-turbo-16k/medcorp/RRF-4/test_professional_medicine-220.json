    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Changing the alpha level from 0.05 to 0.01 means that the threshold for statistical significance is stricter. This means that the study will require stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis and find a statistically significant result. Therefore, the most likely result is that there is a decreased likelihood of a Type I error, which is the incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis. This means that option C, 'There is a decreased likelihood of a Type II error,' is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
