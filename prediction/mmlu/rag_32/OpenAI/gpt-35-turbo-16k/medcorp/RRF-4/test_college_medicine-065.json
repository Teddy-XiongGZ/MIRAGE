    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. The documents state that purines (adenine and guanine) always pair with pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine) through hydrogen bonding. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (three hydrogen bonds). This complementary base pairing is a fundamental feature of DNA structure. Therefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is always 1:1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. always 1:1.\"}"
