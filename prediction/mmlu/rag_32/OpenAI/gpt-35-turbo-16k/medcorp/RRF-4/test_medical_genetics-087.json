    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that causes achondroplasia results in a gain-of-function effect. Document [0] states that the mutation causes gain of FGFR3 function, affecting many tissues, particularly the cartilaginous growth plate. Document [1] also mentions that the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active. Additionally, Document [14] states that the point mutation in the gene coding for the transmembrane portion of FGFR3 results in achondroplasia. Therefore, the correct answer is B. gain-of-function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
