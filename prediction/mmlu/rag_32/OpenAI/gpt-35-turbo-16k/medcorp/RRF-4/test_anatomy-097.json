    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information can be found in Document [3] (Title: Histology, Oral Mucosa -- Structure -- Oral Epithelium) and Document [4] (Title: Mucogingival junction). According to Document [3], the oral mucosa can be classified into three types: lining mucosa, masticatory mucosa, and specialized mucosa. The lining mucosa is found on the soft palate, cheeks, lips, alveolar mucosa, the floor of the mouth, and vestibular fornix. It is a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. According to Document [4], the mucogingival junction is the area where the mucosa of the cheeks and floor of the mouth meets the mucosa around the teeth and on the palate. In a normal healthy mouth, the mucosa covering the alveolar process supporting the mandibular teeth would be part of the lining mucosa, which is non-keratinized. Therefore, the correct answer is B. light pink below the mucogingival junction and red above it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
