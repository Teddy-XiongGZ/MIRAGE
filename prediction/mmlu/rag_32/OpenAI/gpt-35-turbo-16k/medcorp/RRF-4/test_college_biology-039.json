    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents that discuss embryonic development. Document [3] provides information on the main stages of animal embryonic development, including the formation of organs. Document [4] explains that embryonic development starts with the fertilization of an egg cell and the formation of a zygote. Document [15] describes the early stage of embryonic development, starting from the zygote and continuing through the formation of body structures. Document [19] discusses the major events occurring during the first month of human embryonic development. Based on these documents, we can conclude that an embryologist studying the development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus would observe the formation of body structures and the development of organs, but there is no evidence to support the specific conclusions mentioned in the answer choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
