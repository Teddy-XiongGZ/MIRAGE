    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis, along with thick nasal secretions and salty sweat. These symptoms are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). Genetic testing shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that two mutations in the CFTR gene are typically required for the clinical phenotype. However, there are some CFTR mutations, such as G551D, that can cause CF even when present in only one allele. Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's clinical phenotype is that only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
