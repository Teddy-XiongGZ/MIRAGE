    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mammals are known to be homeostatic, which means they have mechanisms to maintain a stable internal environment. To determine which of the given options mammals are not homeostatic for, we need to review the information in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that homeostatic mechanisms in humans and other mammals keep the composition of the extracellular fluid constant, including the concentrations of sodium, potassium, glucose, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. Document [4] states that maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain and that the basic principle of homeostasis is negative feedback. Document [8] provides an example of a homeostatic failure in type 1 diabetes mellitus, where blood sugar regulation is unable to function due to the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas. Based on this information, we can conclude that mammals are homeostatic for body temperature, blood glucose concentration, and blood pH. Therefore, the correct answer is D. metabolic rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
