    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During all-out exercise such as sprinting, the first fiber types to fatigue are typically the fast-twitch fibers, specifically the Type IIa and Type IIX fibers. These fibers have a higher contraction velocity and are more prone to fatigue compared to the slow-twitch Type I fibers. While Type I fibers may also contribute to fatigue during prolonged or repeated sprints, they are generally more resistant to fatigue and are recruited at lower intensities of exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Type IIa fibres.\"}"
