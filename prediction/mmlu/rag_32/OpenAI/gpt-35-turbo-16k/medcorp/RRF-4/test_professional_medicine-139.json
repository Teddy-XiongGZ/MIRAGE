    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, and agitation, along with vital signs indicating hypotension and poor perfusion. The delayed capillary refill, cool extremities, and low oxyhemoglobin saturation in a central vein suggest poor tissue perfusion. Given the history of diarrhea, the most likely cause of shock in this patient is hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is a significant loss of intravascular volume, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hypovolemic\"}"
