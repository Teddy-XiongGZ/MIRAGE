    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modification in the RNA sequence results in a single nucleotide change from U to C at position 24. This change leads to a change in the codon from UAC (tyrosine) to CAC (histidine). Therefore, the modified RNA strand will produce a different amino acid sequence, leading to a different protein. Since the modification results in a change in the amino acid sequence, it is likely that the modified protein will be different from the original protein. Therefore, the most likely outcome of this modification is the production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
