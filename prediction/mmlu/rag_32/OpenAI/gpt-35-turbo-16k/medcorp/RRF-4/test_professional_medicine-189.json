Physical examination shows normal female body habitus, normal breast development, and normal appearing external genitalia. She has no axillary or pubic hair. The most likely explanation for this clinical presentation is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). AIS is a disorder of sex development characterized by complete or partial resistance to the biological actions of androgens in individuals who are genetically male (XY) with normally developed testes. This results in the development of female external genitalia and breast development, but absence or sparse pubic and axillary hair.
