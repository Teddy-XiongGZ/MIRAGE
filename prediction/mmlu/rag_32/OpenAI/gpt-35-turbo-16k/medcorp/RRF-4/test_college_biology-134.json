    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that mtDNA is useful for assessing genetic relationships among individuals or groups within a species and for identifying and quantifying the phylogeny among different species. It also mentions that mtDNA is inherited from the mother and does not undergo recombination. Document [2] supports this by stating that mtDNA is easier to type from highly decomposed and processed tissue compared to nuclear DNA. Document [16] mentions that mtDNA is used to determine maternal lineages. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is B. mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
