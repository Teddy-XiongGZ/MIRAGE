    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement about embryonic cleavage is NOT true, we need to evaluate each statement based on the information provided in the relevant documents. \\n\\nA. The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage: According to Document [12], cleavage can be either holoblastic (total) or meroblastic (partial), and meroblastic cleavage occurs in animals whose eggs have more yolk. This suggests that the presence of yolk does not inhibit cleavage, so statement A is NOT true. \\n\\nB. Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage: According to Document [12], meroblastic cleavage occurs in animals whose eggs have more yolk, such as birds and reptiles. Telolecithal eggs have a large amount of yolk concentrated at one end, so it is likely that they undergo meroblastic cleavage. Therefore, statement B is likely true. \\n\\nC. The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole: There is no specific information in the documents that directly addresses this statement. Therefore, we cannot determine if statement C is true or not. \\n\\nD. The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres: According to Document [9], cleavage is the period of rapid mitotic cell divisions that occur after fertilization, and it results in the production of blastomeres. This suggests that the rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres, so statement D is likely true. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is NOT true is statement A, which states that the presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
