    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old male with a painful swelling over the sacral prominence that began after a fall. The examination reveals an erythematous, fluctuant, elevated mass with midline pores. Rectal examination is normal. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pilonidal abscess. Pilonidal abscesses typically occur in the sacrococcygeal region and are characterized by a painful, erythematous, fluctuant mass with midline pores. They are commonly seen in young males and can be precipitated by trauma or prolonged sitting. Anocutaneous fistula is unlikely as there are no signs of induration or pain on rectal examination. Coccygodynia refers to pain in the coccyx and does not present with an erythematous, fluctuant mass. Hidradenitis suppurativa typically presents with recurrent painful nodules in the axillary, inguinal, or anogenital regions, and does not typically involve the sacral prominence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
