    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with early awakening at night, which is a form of insomnia. The first step in managing insomnia is to identify and address any underlying causes or contributing factors. In this case, the patient's early awakening may be related to his alcohol consumption before bedtime. Alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to early morning awakenings. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient's insomnia would be to advise him to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol (choice A). This may help improve his sleep quality and prevent early awakenings. The other options, such as reading and snacking in bed (choice B) or prescribing a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen (choice C), are not supported by evidence and may not address the underlying cause of the patient's insomnia. Prescribing sertraline (choice D) is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of depression or other psychiatric conditions that would warrant the use of an antidepressant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
