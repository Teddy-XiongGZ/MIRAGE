    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Plasmid vectors are commonly used for cloning purposes. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. can generally accommodate larger inserts than phage vectors can: The documents mention that plasmid vectors can clone DNA inserts of up to 15 kb in size, while phage vectors are used to clone longer lengths of DNA. Therefore, option A is not correct.\\n\\nB. grow within bacteria, and are present in bacterial colonies on an agar plate: The documents mention that plasmid vectors are introduced into bacteria by transformation and can be grown in large amounts within bacteria. Therefore, option B is correct.\\n\\nC. can accommodate inserts of over 100 kilobases: The documents mention that plasmid vectors can clone DNA inserts of up to 15 kb in size. Therefore, option C is not correct.\\n\\nD. include centromeres to allow propagation in yeast: The documents do not mention the inclusion of centromeres in plasmid vectors for propagation in yeast. Therefore, option D is not correct.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. grow within bacteria, and are present in bacterial colonies on an agar plate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
