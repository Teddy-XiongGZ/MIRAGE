    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why the genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings remain in the gene pool of the population. To answer this, we need to consider the fitness consequences for both the host bird and the cuckoo. Option A suggests that the host birds' response allows them to efficiently rear their own young by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry. Option B suggests that the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when it rears an interloper of another species. Option C suggests that on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own. Option D suggests that if the genes that allow the host bird to be duped were to reduce the fitness of the cuckoo, then the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would be reduced. Let's evaluate each option. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
