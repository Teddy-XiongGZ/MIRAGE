    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is NOT true regarding the function of neurons, we need to analyze each statement one by one. \\n\\nA. Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire. This statement is true. After an action potential, the neuron undergoes a refractory period during which it is less likely to fire another action potential.\\n\\nB. The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential. This statement is true. During the depolarization phase of an action potential, sodium ions flow into the neuron, causing the membrane potential to become more positive.\\n\\nC. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites. This statement is NOT true. Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals of the transmitting neuron, not from its dendrites.\\n\\nD. An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential. This statement is true. The axon hillock is the region of the neuron where action potentials are initiated when the membrane potential reaches the threshold potential.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
