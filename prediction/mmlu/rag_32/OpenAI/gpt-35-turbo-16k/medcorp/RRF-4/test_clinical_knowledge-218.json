    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When an action potential arrives at the motor endplate, it causes the release of acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction. This is supported by multiple documents that mention the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal of the motor neuron. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, leading to muscle cell depolarization and the initiation of muscle contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is A. acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
