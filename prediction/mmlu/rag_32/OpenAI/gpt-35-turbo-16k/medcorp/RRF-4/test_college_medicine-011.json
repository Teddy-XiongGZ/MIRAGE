    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The major product of the reaction is 2-butene, which suggests that the reaction involves an elimination reaction. In elimination reactions, a leaving group is removed from a molecule, resulting in the formation of a double bond. In this case, the leaving group is likely the bromine atom. The fact that 2-butene is the major product suggests that the bromine atom is located on the second carbon atom of the starting compound. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Carbon 3 has less hydrogen atoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
