    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the characteristic that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that angiosperms differ from other seed plants in several ways, including the fact that their seeds are enclosed within an ovary. Document [1] also mentions that angiosperms enclose their seeds behind the stigma, while gymnosperms have seeds that are not enclosed within an ovary.
