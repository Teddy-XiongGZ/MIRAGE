    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement identifies a chemically based sensory system, we need to understand the nature of each system. The gustatory system is responsible for the sense of taste, which involves the detection of chemical stimuli in the form of taste molecules. The auditory system, on the other hand, is responsible for the sense of hearing and does not involve the detection of chemical stimuli. The olfactory system is responsible for the sense of smell, which also involves the detection of chemical stimuli in the form of odor molecules. Based on this information, statement I (Gustatory system) and statement III (Olfactory system) both identify chemically based sensory systems. Therefore, the correct answer is D. I and III only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
