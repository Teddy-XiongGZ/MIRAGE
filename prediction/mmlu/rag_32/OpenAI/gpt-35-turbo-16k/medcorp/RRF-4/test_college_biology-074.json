    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following statements is true of air as compared to water, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that water is tasteless, odorless, and a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. It also states that water has weak absorption bands at wavelengths of around 750 nm, which cause it to appear blue. Document [28] discusses the formation of rain and mentions that air contains water vapor. Document [30] mentions that air is one of the four classical elements along with water, earth, and fire.
