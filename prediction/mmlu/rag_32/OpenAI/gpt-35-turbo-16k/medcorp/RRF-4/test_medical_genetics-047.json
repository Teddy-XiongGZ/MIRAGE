    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine why Arabidopsis is advantageous for plant genetic research, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [4] states that Arabidopsis has a small genome size, making it easier to sequence and study. Document [7] mentions that Arabidopsis is a small plant with a short life cycle, which makes it convenient for cultivation in a small space and allows for rapid experimentation. Document [14] highlights that Arabidopsis has been extensively used for reverse genetic studies, thanks to the availability of large collections of mutant lines. Based on this information, we can conclude that Arabidopsis is advantageous for plant genetic research because it is a small plant with a small genome size, which can be raised inexpensively.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
