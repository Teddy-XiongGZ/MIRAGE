    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The original DNA sequence is 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019. A point mutation involves a change in a single nucleotide. Let's assume that the point mutation changes the second nucleotide from A to T. So, the mutated sequence would be 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019. Now, let's consider a deletion. If a deletion occurs, a segment of DNA is removed. Let's assume that the deletion removes the third nucleotide, which is A. So, the final sequence after both the point mutation and deletion would be 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
