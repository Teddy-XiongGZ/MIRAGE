    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Both meiosis and mitosis are processes of cell division. In meiosis, there are two rounds of cell division (meiosis I and meiosis II), while in mitosis, there is only one round of cell division. The phases of the cell cycle that are common to both meiosis and mitosis are G2 phase and S phase. G0 phase is a resting phase and is not involved in cell division. Therefore, the correct answer is C. II and III only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
