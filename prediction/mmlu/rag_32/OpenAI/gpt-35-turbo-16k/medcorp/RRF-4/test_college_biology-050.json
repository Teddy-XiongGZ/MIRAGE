    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chemosynthetic bacteria are able to produce their own food without the need for photon-absorbing pigments. This is because they derive energy by either oxidizing or reducing inorganic substances. Option A and B both involve the oxidation or reduction of inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen. Option C involves the oxidation of organic compounds, which is not the primary source of energy for chemosynthetic bacteria. Option D, transducing light energy into chemical energy, is not applicable to chemosynthetic bacteria as they do not have photon-absorbing pigments. Therefore, the correct answer is either A or B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
