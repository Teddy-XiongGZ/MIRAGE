    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement corresponds most accurately with strong acids, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [3] states that a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water, yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A-. This means that strong acids have stable conjugate bases. Therefore, the correct answer is C. They have stable conjugate bases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
