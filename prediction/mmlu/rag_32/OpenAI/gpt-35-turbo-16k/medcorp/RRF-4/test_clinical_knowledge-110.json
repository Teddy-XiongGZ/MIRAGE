    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information about the auscultatory gap can be found in Document [1]. According to this document, the auscultatory gap is a period of diminished or absent Korotkoff sounds during the manual measurement of blood pressure. It is associated with reduced peripheral blood flow caused by changes in the pulse wave. The improper interpretation of this gap may lead to blood pressure monitoring errors, such as an underestimation of systolic blood pressure and/or an overestimation of diastolic blood pressure. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. when the Korotkoff sounds disappear then return during phase 2 as the bladder is deflated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
