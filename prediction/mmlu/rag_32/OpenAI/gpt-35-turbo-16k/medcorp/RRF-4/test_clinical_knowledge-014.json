    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle are actin and myosin. Document [0] mentions that skeletal muscle is composed of two fiber types: Type I slow-twitch and Type II fast-twitch muscle. Document [2] states that actin and myosin are the two important regulatory proteins associated with muscle contraction. Document [8] also mentions that actin and myosin filaments are the two protein filaments of myofibrils in muscle cells. Therefore, the correct answer is B. actin and myosin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
