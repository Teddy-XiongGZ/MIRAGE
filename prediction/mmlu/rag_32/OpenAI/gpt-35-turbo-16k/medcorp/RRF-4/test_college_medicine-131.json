    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"For very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, the initial energy source is likely to come from the ATP stores in the muscle. This is because ATP is the immediate source of energy for muscle contractions. Glycolysis and creatine phosphorylation are also involved in energy production during muscle contractions, but they are not the initial sources of energy for very high force contractions. Phosphocreatine stores can be used to replenish ATP during high-intensity exercise, but they are not the initial energy source.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. ATP stores.\"}"
