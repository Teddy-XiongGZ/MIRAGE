    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, it is mentioned that the first lungs were developed in vertebrates, specifically in lungless salamanders and in the embryos of oviparous species. It is also mentioned that mammalian embryos do not use their lungs during the prenatal period and gas exchange is performed via the maternal respiratory apparatus. Therefore, the first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs would be the oviparous species, which include amphibians and reptiles. Therefore, the correct answer is either A. amphibians or B. reptiles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
