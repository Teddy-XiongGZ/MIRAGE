    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the active pool of carbon that is the largest on Earth and contributes the most to carbon cycling. To determine the answer, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth. Document [1] mentions that marine organisms play a significant role in linking the carbon cycle.
