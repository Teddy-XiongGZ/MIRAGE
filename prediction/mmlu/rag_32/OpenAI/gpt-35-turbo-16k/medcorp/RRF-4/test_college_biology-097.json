    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antibiotics that affect bacterial cells can interfere with various cellular processes. Peptidoglycan synthesis is targeted by antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins. Protein synthesis is targeted by antibiotics such as macrolides and tetracyclines. DNA synthesis can be targeted by antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones. However, reverse transcriptase is not a process that occurs in bacterial cells, but rather in retroviruses. Therefore, antibiotics do not interfere with reverse transcriptase. Therefore, the correct answer is D. reverse transcriptase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
