    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a bloody nose that has been dripping for the past 2 hours. The examination reveals that the bleeding is coming from the septal mucosa of the right naris. The patient also has a blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg. Given the history and examination findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to control the bleeding by applying direct pressure to the nares. Pinching the nares together for 5 minutes is a simple and effective method to control anterior epistaxis. This can be done by instructing the patient to pinch the soft part of the nose (the nares) together with their thumb and index finger for 5 minutes. This maneuver helps to compress the bleeding vessels and promote clot formation. It is important to note that the patient's elevated blood pressure may contribute to the bleeding, so controlling the blood pressure may also be necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
