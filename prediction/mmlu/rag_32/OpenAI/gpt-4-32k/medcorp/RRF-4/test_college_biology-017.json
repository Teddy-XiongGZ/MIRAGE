    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that when a young male bird is reared in isolation and hears only the song of a different bird species, he develops an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This suggests that the bird does not instinctively know the song of its own species, otherwise it would have been able to produce it even in isolation. Therefore, the song is not entirely instinctive. On the other hand, the fact that the bird develops a song that is different from its own species when exposed to the song of a different species suggests that the bird is capable of learning songs. Therefore, the song is not entirely learned either, as the bird fails to produce the song of its own species in isolation. This leads to the conclusion that the song of the bird is both instinctive and learned.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
