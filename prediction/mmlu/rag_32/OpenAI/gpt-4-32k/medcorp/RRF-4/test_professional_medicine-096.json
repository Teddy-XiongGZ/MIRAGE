    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of progressive weakness, inability to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself, along with the skin findings of a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles, are indicative of a condition affecting both the skin and muscles. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy typically presents earlier in childhood and does not involve skin changes. Eczema does not cause muscle weakness. Lyme disease can cause muscle weakness but would not typically cause the specific skin findings seen in this patient. Dermatomyositis, however, is a condition that affects both the skin and muscles, causing a characteristic rash and progressive muscle weakness. The rash often involves the face, knuckles, elbows, knees, and chest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
