    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The comparison group in this study is shipyard workers who were not diagnosed with mesothelioma but had chest x-rays. The reason for selecting this group is to ensure that the comparison is fair and accurate. If the comparison group did not have chest x-rays, it could be possible that some of them actually had mesothelioma but it was not diagnosed, which would lead to ascertainment bias. Ascertainment bias occurs when the disease status is not accurately determined in the study groups. By ensuring that all subjects in the study had chest x-rays, the researchers are minimizing the risk of this bias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
