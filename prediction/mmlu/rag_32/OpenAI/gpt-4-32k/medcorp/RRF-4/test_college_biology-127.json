    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Homeotic genes are responsible for the proper formation and arrangement of body parts in an organism. When these genes are mutated, they can cause a body part to form in the wrong place, a phenomenon known as homeosis. This is evident in Document [0], which mentions that unusual disturbances were found in the organization of the adult fly, resulting in misplaced limbs. Document [18] also supports this, stating that mutations in homeotic selector genes do not lead to elimination of a segment or pattern, but instead cause the segment to develop incorrectly. Therefore, the correct answer is that mutation of homeotic cluster genes often results in the transformation of one segment into another.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
