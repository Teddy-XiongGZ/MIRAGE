    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, it's important to understand that blood clots can form in catheters due to various reasons such as trauma to the vein during placement or due to certain conditions like cancer. Document [0] and [2] provide this information. Document [18] and [24] suggest that Alteplase, a thrombolytic medication, can be used to clear blood clots that obstruct a catheter. However, the question asks what should be done if blood clots are 'repeatedly' blocking a catheter. In such a case, it might be necessary to consider removing the catheter and recatheterizing, as the current catheter might be contributing to the formation of clots. Therefore, the answer would be D. Remove the catheter and recatheterize.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
