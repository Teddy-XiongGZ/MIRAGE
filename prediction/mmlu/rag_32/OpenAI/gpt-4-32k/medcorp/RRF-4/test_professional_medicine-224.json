    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sore throat, fever, voice changes, and difficulty swallowing, along with physical examination findings of erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate, uvula deviation to the left, and a white exudate on the right tonsil, are suggestive of peritonsillar abscess. This condition is a complication of tonsillitis and is most commonly caused by group A Streptococcus. Trismus, or difficulty opening the mouth, is a common finding in peritonsillar abscess due to inflammation and spasm of the muscles of mastication. The most appropriate management of peritonsillar abscess is drainage of the abscess in addition to antibiotic therapy. Incision and drainage or needle aspiration can be used to drain the abscess. Corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are not typically used in the management of peritonsillar abscess. Nystatin is an antifungal medication and would not be appropriate in this case as the cause is likely bacterial. Salt water gargle may provide some symptomatic relief but would not address the underlying abscess.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
