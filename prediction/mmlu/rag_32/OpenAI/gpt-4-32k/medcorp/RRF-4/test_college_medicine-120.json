    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that blood lactate was 6.0+/-0.4 and 5.0+/-0.4 mM during the first and second halves, respectively. This indicates that blood lactate concentration decreases in the second half of the game. Document [12] also states that blood lactate concentration is lowered during the second half of the game. Document [19] states that blood lactate concentration was 4-5 mmol/L during the game, which is higher than 3 mM. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Document [22] states that blood lactate concentration increased to 4.4 mmol/L after the game, which indicates that blood lactate concentration can increase as the game progresses. Therefore, option D is incorrect. Based on these documents, the blood lactate concentration is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
