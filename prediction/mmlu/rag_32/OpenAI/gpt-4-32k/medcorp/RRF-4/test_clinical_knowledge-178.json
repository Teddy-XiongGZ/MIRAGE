    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that enzyme activity can be affected by changes in pH, temperature, and substrate concentration. Document [2] also mentions that an enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH. Document [16] mentions that several factors affect the activity of enzymes including temperature, pH, and concentration of enzyme. Therefore, both temperature and pH can affect enzyme activity. Document [24] mentions that the activity of the enzyme forms was also differentially stimulated by monovalent cations, K(+) being the most effective activator. This suggests that the presence of certain metal ions can also affect enzyme activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above.\"}"
