    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where a female fruit fly with gray body and normal wings mates with a male fruit fly with black body and vestigial wings. The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny indicates that there has been a recombination of the parental traits. This recombination of traits from different chromosomes is a result of crossing over, a process that occurs during meiosis where homologous chromosomes exchange segments and therefore genetic material. Independent assortment, segregation of alleles, and penetrance do not explain the recombination of traits in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
