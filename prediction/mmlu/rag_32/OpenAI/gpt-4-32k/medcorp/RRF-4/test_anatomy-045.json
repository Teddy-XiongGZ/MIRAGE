    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The viscerocranium refers to the facial skeleton. According to Document [1], the bones of the viscerocranium are formed either by intramembranous ossification or endochondral ossification. However, Document [5] specifies that the viscerocranium undergoes intramembranous ossification. This process involves the direct mineralization of mesenchymal connective tissue without the need for a transitional cartilaginous component. As for the growth pattern, Document [2] and Document [9] suggest that the viscerocranium follows a different growth pattern than the neurocranium, growing to more than twice its size and undergoing greater changes. This suggests that the viscerocranium does not follow the neural growth pattern. Therefore, the answer should be that the bones of the viscerocranium develop initially by intramembranous ossification and follow the somatic growth pattern.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
