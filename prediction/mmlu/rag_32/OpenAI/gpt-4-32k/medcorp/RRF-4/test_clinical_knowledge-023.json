    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide any information about 50% of over 65s providing informal care, so option A is not correct. Similarly, there is no information about the majority of informal carers being fit and active, so option D is not correct. The documents also do not suggest that informal carers should not be included in discharge planning, so option C is not correct. However, Document [16] does mention that the number of informal caregivers is increasing, and Document [20] suggests that the prevalence of informal caregiving is increasing, especially among those over the age of 60. This information aligns with option B, suggesting that one in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
