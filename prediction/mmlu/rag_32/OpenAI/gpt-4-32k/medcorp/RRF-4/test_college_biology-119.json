    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gene flow refers to the transfer of genetic material from one population to another. This process can occur through various mechanisms such as migration, where individuals move from one population to another, or through the exchange of pollen in plant species. When gene flow occurs, it can lead to a reduction in the genetic differentiation between the two populations, thereby increasing genetic homogeneity. This is because the genes that are being transferred are being mixed into the gene pool of the other population, which can lead to a more uniform distribution of genetic traits. Therefore, gene flow does not increase the rate of deleterious mutations, nor does it disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. While gene flow can slow down the process of speciation by reducing genetic differences between populations, it does not necessarily increase the likelihood of speciation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
