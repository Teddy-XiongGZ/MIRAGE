    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. Document [0] mentions that the ATP turnover rate was initially high and decreased during the later stages of contraction. It also mentions that the phosphocreatine (PCr) store decreased exponentially during contraction and was practically depleted at 50 s. This suggests that phosphocreatine is used as an initial energy source during high force contractions. Document [2] also supports this, mentioning that ATP turnover was determined from the change in high energy phosphates and lactate production, suggesting that phosphocreatine is used initially.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. phosphocreatine stores.\"}"
