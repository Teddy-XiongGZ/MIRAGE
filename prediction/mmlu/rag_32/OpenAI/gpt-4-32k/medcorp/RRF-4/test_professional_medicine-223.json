    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of rotatory vertigo, imbalance, decreased hearing, tinnitus, a sense of fullness of the right ear, and vomiting are indicative of an inner ear problem. Acoustic neuroma usually presents with unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, but vertigo is not a common symptom. Benign positional vertigo typically presents with brief episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position, which is not the case here.
