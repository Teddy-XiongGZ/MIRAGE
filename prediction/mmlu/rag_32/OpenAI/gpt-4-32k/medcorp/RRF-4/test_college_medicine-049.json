    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to balance the chemical equation for the combustion of ethane. The balanced equation is: C2H6 + 7/2 O2 -> 2 CO2 + 3 H2O. From this equation, we can see that 1 mole of ethane (C2H6) produces 2 moles of carbon dioxide (CO2). The molar mass of ethane is (2*12) + (6*1) = 30 g/mol. So, 84g of ethane is 84/30 = 2.8 moles. Since 1 mole of ethane produces 2 moles of CO2, 2.8 moles of ethane will produce 2.8*2 = 5.6 moles of CO2. The molar mass of CO2 is (12) + (2*16) = 44 g/mol. Therefore, 5.6 moles of CO2 is 5.6*44 = 246.4g. So, the closest answer is 264g.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
