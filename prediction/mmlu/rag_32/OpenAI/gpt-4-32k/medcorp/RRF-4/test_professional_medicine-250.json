    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is worried about becoming addicted to the morphine she is receiving for pain management after her surgery. It's important to note that the patient has no history of substance use disorder and her alcohol consumption is moderate. The patient is in severe pain due to multiple surgeries and injuries, and morphine is an appropriate medication for managing this level of pain. The risk of addiction in such cases is low, especially when the medication is used as directed by a physician. Administering naloxone is not appropriate as this is used to treat opioid overdose and the patient is not showing signs of this. Switching to oral acetaminophen may not provide the level of pain relief needed after such extensive surgery. Using lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, would not be appropriate for pain management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
