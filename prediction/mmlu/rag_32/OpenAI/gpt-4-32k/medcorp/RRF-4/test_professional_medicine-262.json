    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with greenish discharge from her nipple, which is not associated with any other symptoms such as fever or trauma. She is not currently using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, which can sometimes cause nipple discharge. Her last pregnancy was 20 years ago, so this is unlikely to be related to lactation. Looking at the options, breast cancer usually presents with a lump and the discharge is often bloody, not green. Pituitary adenoma would likely present with other symptoms related to hormonal imbalance, which this patient does not have. Fibrocystic disease usually presents with breast pain and lumps, which this patient does not report. Mammary duct ectasia, on the other hand, can cause green or black nipple discharge and often occurs in women nearing or post-menopause, which fits this patient's age group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
