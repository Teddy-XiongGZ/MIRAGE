    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transcriptional activator proteins are involved in the process of transcription, not translation, so options B and D can be eliminated. They are not specifically produced during a bacterial infection by a phage, so option C can also be eliminated. According to the documents, transcriptional activator proteins bind to regions near a gene and facilitate the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, enabling the transcription of the gene. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
