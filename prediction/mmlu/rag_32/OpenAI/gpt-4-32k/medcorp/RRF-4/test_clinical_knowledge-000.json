    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The size of the cannula used for a rapid blood transfusion is important because it affects the flow rate of the transfusion. According to Document [2], catheters with a larger diameter and shorter length yield the highest flow rates. This is crucial in a massive transfusion where rapid blood replacement is imperative. The document suggests that large-bore catheters, typically ranging from 14 to 18 gauge, are used in most patients undergoing a massive transfusion. Document [11] also supports this, stating that short, large-diameter catheters provided the greatest infusion rates of massive transfusion blood products for the least pressure. Therefore, for a rapid blood transfusion, a larger gauge cannula would be more appropriate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
