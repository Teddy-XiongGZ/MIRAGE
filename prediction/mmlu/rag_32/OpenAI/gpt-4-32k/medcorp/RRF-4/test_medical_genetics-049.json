    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the gene that is not a tumour suppressor gene. From my knowledge and the documents provided, APC, NF1, and RB1 are all known tumour suppressor genes. RET, on the other hand, is a proto-oncogene, which means it has the potential to cause cancer when it is mutated or expressed at high levels. Therefore, RET is not a tumour suppressor gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
