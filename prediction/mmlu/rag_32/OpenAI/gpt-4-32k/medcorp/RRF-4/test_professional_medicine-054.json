    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects. The key point here is that the efficacy among African American subjects was determined through a post hoc analysis, which means it was not the primary outcome measure of the study. This is important because when a study is designed, it is typically powered to detect a difference in the primary outcome measure. If the efficacy among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure, the study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in this subgroup. Therefore, the results of the post hoc analysis should be interpreted with caution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure\"}"
