    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Net primary productivity refers to the rate at which plants in an ecosystem produce useful chemical energy. To answer this question, I need to find information on the factors that influence net primary productivity in different regions, particularly in the tropics. Document [0] mentions that global changes in climate have eased several critical climatic constraints to plant growth, such that net primary productivity increased globally, with the largest increase in tropical ecosystems. This is attributed to decreased cloud cover and the resulting increase in solar radiation. Document [1] discusses the relationship between photosynthesis, net primary productivity, and growth in forest ecosystems. It mentions that gross primary productivity has a simple relationship with seasonal water deficit. Document [2] suggests that the relatively high temperatures in the tropics generate and maintain high diversity because 'the Red Queen runs faster when she is hot'. Document [13] suggests that the amount of available energy sets limits to the richness of the system. Thus, increased solar energy (with an abundance of water) at low latitudes causes increased net primary productivity (or photosynthesis). This hypothesis proposes the higher the net primary productivity the more individuals can be supported, and the more species there will be in an area. Based on these documents, it seems that the availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis, which in turn increases net primary productivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
