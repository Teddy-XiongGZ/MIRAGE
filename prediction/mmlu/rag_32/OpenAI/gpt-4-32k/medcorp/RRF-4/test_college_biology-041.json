    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Centrifugation is a process that uses centrifugal force to separate particles from a solution based on their size, shape, density, and viscosity. Low-speed centrifugation is typically used to pellet large particles or cells, while smaller particles remain in the supernatant. According to Document [7], the smaller the subcellular component, the greater is the centrifugal force required to sediment it. Therefore, we need to find the pair where one component is significantly larger than the other. Nuclei are larger than secretory vesicles, so they could be separated by low-speed centrifugation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
