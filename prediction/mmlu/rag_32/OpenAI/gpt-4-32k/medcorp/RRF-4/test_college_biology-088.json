    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tissue in a plant that would have the highest rate of oxygen production during photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments. During this process, oxygen is produced as a byproduct. This process primarily occurs in the mesophyll cells of leaves, which contain chloroplasts, the organelles where photosynthesis takes place. Among the options provided, the palisade mesophyll is a layer of cells in the leaves of plants where most photosynthesis occurs due to its high chloroplast content. Therefore, it would have the highest rate of oxygen production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
