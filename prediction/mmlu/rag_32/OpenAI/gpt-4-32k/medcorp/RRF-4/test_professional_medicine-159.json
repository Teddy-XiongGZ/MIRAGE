    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relative risk is calculated by dividing the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group by the probability of the event occurring in the non-exposed group. In this case, the event is death from a particular type of cancer. The exposed group is the individuals who took Drug X and the non-exposed group is the individuals who did not take Drug X. The probability of death from this type of cancer in the exposed group is 100/200 = 0.5. The probability of death from this type of cancer in the non-exposed group is 100/400 = 0.25. Therefore, the relative risk is 0.5/0.25 = 2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
