    "First, I need to understand what happens when electrons flow cyclically through the electron transport chain associated with photosystem I in eukaryotic photosynthetic cells. From Document [7], I learned that cyclic electron transport or Cyclic photophosphorylation produces only ATP. The noncyclic variety involves the participation of both photosystems, while the cyclic electron flow is dependent on only photosystem I. This information directly answers the question. So, the answer is \"Synthesis of ATP\". The JSON output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I need to understand what happens when electrons flow cyclically through the electron transport chain associated with photosystem I in eukaryotic photosynthetic cells.
