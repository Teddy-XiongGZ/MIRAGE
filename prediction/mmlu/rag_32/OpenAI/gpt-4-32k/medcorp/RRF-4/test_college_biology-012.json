    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we know that the red fox is a major predator of hares. Therefore, if the fox population decreases due to the mange mite, there would be less predation pressure on the hares. This would likely lead to an increase in the hare population. On the other hand, if the mange mite population increases, it would negatively affect the fox population, leading to a decrease in their numbers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.\"}"
