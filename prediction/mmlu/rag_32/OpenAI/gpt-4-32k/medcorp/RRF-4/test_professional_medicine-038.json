    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism that maintains serum glucose concentration in a fasting state, which is 12 hours after a meal. The body maintains blood glucose levels through a process called glycogenolysis, where the liver breaks down glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream. This process is crucial during fasting states, such as sleep, when glucose is not being supplied by food. Gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal (Choice A) is not the correct answer because absorption of nutrients from a meal typically occurs within a few hours. Glucose release from skeletal muscle (Choice B) is also incorrect because skeletal muscle lacks the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is necessary for the release of glucose into the bloodstream. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues (Choice D) is not the correct answer because leptin is a hormone that regulates energy balance by inhibiting hunger, not by directly influencing blood glucose levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
