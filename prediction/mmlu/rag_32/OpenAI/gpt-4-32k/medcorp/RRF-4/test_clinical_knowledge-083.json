    "First, we need to calculate the total amount of dopamine the person will receive per minute. This is done by multiplying the rate of dopamine (4 micrograms/kg/min) by the person's weight (65 kg). This gives us 260 micrograms/min. Next, we need to convert this rate to an hourly rate. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the per minute rate by 60. This gives us 15600 micrograms/hour. Finally, we need to convert micrograms to milligrams. Since there are 1000 micrograms in a milligram, we divide the total micrograms by 1000. This gives us 15.6 milligrams/hour. So, a 65 kg person receiving dopamine at a rate of 4 micrograms/kg/min will receive 15.6 milligrams in an hour. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 15.6. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I calculated the total amount of dopamine the person will receive per minute by multiplying the rate of dopamine by the person's weight.
