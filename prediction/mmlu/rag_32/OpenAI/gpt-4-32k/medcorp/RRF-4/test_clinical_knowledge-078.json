    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that insulin binding, glucose transporters, glucose uptake, and glycogenesis are greater in ST than in FT muscles. Document [1] also mentions that glucose uptake was greater for both insulin-stimulated treatments. Document [2] mentions that glucose uptake by muscle requires three steps: delivery of glucose from the blood to the muscle, transport of glucose across the muscle membrane, and phosphorylation of glucose, processes affected by glycaemia and insulinaemia. Document [3] mentions that during exercise, despite decreased insulin concentrations, muscle increases GLUT4 translocation of and glucose uptake. Document [14] mentions that insulin optimizes glycolysis in muscle by catalyzing the glycolytic pathway by increasing hexokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase activity. Document [11] mentions that leucine can facilitate the insulin-induced insulin signaling and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. Document [30] mentions that the presence of glucose in the bloodstream triggers the production and release of insulin from the pancreas' beta islet cells. The main function of insulin is to increase the rate of transport of glucose from the bloodstream into certain cells of the body, such as striated muscles, fibroblasts, and fat cells. It also is necessary for transport of amino acids. All these documents suggest that insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
