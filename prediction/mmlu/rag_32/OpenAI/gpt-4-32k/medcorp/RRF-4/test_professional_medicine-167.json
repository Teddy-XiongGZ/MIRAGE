    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 10-month-old boy with a history of fever, cough, and rapid breathing. His symptoms began with a low-grade fever and clear nasal discharge, which then progressed to a moist, nonproductive cough and rapid breathing. He also has physical signs of respiratory distress, including nasal flaring and intercostal retractions. His chest examination reveals bilateral, diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi. These symptoms are suggestive of a lower respiratory tract infection, likely bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is most commonly caused by the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), which is an RNA virus. Therefore, the infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has a single-stranded RNA genome, which is not an option here. However, RSV does mediate cell entry via a fusion protein, which is a characteristic of some RNA viruses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
