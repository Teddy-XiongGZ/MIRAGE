    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a single nucleotide change in the FBN1 gene that does not change the amino acid at that locus. This means it is a synonymous mutation, which usually does not affect the protein function. Furthermore, the same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome, suggesting that this change is not unique to individuals with the disease. Therefore, it is unlikely to be a disease-causing mutation. The fact that it is found in a significant proportion of the healthy population suggests that it is a common variation in the gene, also known as a polymorphism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. It is a polymorphism\"}"
