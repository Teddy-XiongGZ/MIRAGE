    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The internal capsule is a white matter structure situated in the inferomedial part of each cerebral hemisphere of the brain. It carries information past the basal ganglia, going to the thalamus, from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex, and from the cerebral cortex to the brain stem and spinal cord. The corticospinal tract, which originates from the primary motor cortex and premotor areas, is located in the anterior half of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. This tract is responsible for voluntary motor control of the body and limbs. A cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or stroke, in the area of the left internal capsule would disrupt these motor signals to the right leg. This would result in paralysis of the right leg. However, because the corticospinal tract is an upper motor neuron, the type of paralysis would be spastic rather than flaccid. Spastic paralysis is characterized by hypertonia, or increased muscle tone, and hyperreflexia, or overactive reflexes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
