    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first brachial arch, also known as the mandibular arch, gives rise to certain muscles in the body. According to Document [27], all of the pharyngeal muscles that come from the first pharyngeal arch are innervated by the mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve. These muscles include all the muscles of mastication, the anterior belly of the digastric, the mylohyoid, tensor tympani, and tensor veli palatini.
