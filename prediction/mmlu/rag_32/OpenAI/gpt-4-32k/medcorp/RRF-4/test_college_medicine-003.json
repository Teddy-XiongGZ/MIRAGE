    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resynthesis of phosphocreatine after high-intensity exercise is mentioned in several documents. Document [4] states that full creatine stores are regenerated within five minutes. Document [28] mentions that the half-time for phosphocreatine resynthesis is 56.6 seconds, which suggests that full resynthesis would take more than a minute. Document [30] also mentions that the resynthesis of creatine phosphate occurs rapidly but is totally inhibited if the local circulation to the muscle is occluded, suggesting it takes some time. Based on these documents, it seems that the resynthesis of phosphocreatine takes more than a minute but less than five minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. about 4 minutes.\"}"
