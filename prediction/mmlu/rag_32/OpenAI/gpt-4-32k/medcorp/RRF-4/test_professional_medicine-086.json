    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard along the upper left sternal border, S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration, and a soft mid-diastolic murmur heard along the lower left sternal border. According to Document [24], an atrial septal defect will present with a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border due to increased volume going through the pulmonary valve, and is associated with a fixed, split S2 and a right ventricular heave. This matches the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an atrial septal defect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
