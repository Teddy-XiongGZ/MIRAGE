    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the strategies employed by C4 and CAM plants to reduce photorespiration. From Document [1], I learned that C4 plants spatially separate the processes of carbon fixation and the Calvin cycle. Carbon fixation occurs in the mesophyll cells, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the bundle sheath cells. From Document [2], I learned that CAM plants temporally separate these processes. They fix carbon dioxide at night and carry out the Calvin cycle during the day, both within the same cells. Now, I will compare this information with the answer choices. Choice A is incorrect because both C4 and CAM plants fix CO2 as the 4-carbon acid oxaloacetate, not as stated. Choice B is correct because it accurately describes the spatial separation in C4 plants and the temporal separation in CAM plants. Choice C is incorrect because it reverses the locations of the processes in C4 plants. Choice D is incorrect because neither C4 nor CAM plants store CO2 as phosphoglycolate or oxaloacetate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
