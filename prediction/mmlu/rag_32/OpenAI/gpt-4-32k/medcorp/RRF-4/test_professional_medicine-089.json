    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's acne is characterized by open and closed comedones, which are typical features of acne vulgaris. Acne vulgaris is a common condition during adolescence and is primarily driven by hormonal changes. The sebaceous glands, which produce sebum, are particularly sensitive to androgens. Increased androgen levels during puberty stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum. When sebum mixes with dead skin cells, it can clog the pores and lead to the formation of comedones, the primary lesions in acne. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne is the stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
