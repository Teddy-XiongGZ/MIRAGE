    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's murmur is described as a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, heard best at the right upper sternal border with radiation into the neck. This description matches the typical presentation of aortic stenosis, which is often characterized by a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border and radiating to the neck. Aortic insufficiency typically presents as a diastolic decrescendo murmur, not a systolic one. Mitral regurgitation typically presents as a holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating to the axilla, not the neck. Mitral stenosis typically presents as a diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex in the left lateral decubitus position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
