    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The statement 'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' is a theory proposed by Ernst Haeckel, which suggests that an organism's developmental stages (ontogeny) repeat the evolutionary stages of its ancestors (phylogeny). However, this theory has been largely discredited (as mentioned in Document 24). The statement 'Early embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species' is not entirely accurate. While early embryos of different species do share some similarities, they are not identical and begin to show species-specific characteristics as development progresses (as mentioned in Document 9). The statement 'A human embryo displays features of adult fish and birds in the course of its development' is also incorrect. While there are similarities in the early stages of development across different species, a human embryo does not display features of adult fish and birds (as mentioned in Document 23). The statement 'An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos' is the most accurate. As mentioned in several documents (e.g., Document 15, Document 1), early stages of embryonic development are similar across different species, including humans, fish, and birds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
