    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phalloidin is a toxin that binds to actin subunits. Actin is a protein that forms microfilaments, one of the three main components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Therefore, the structure that would be most directly affected by phalloidin would be microfilaments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Microfilaments\"}"
