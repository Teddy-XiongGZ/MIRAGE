    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the physiological changes that occur with an increasing number of sprints. Document [2] mentions that with an increase in the number of sprint repetitions, there is a significant increase in blood lactate concentration. This suggests that as the number of sprints increases, the body is relying more on anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactate as a byproduct. This aligns with choice D, which suggests that the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases with an increasing number of sprints. The other options do not seem to be directly supported by the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
