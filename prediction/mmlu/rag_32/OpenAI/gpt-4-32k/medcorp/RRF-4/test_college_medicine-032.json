    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The velocity of a sound wave changes when it moves from one medium to another, as the speed of sound is dependent on the medium through which it is traveling (Document [24]). The intensity of a sound wave can also change when it moves from one medium to another, as the intensity of a wave is dependent on the medium's properties (Document [5]). The wavelength of a sound wave can change when it moves from one medium to another, as the wavelength is dependent on the speed of sound in the medium (Document [29]). However, the frequency of a sound wave does not change when it moves from one medium to another. The frequency of a wave is determined by the source of the wave and is not affected by the medium through which the wave travels (Document [17]).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. frequency\"}"
