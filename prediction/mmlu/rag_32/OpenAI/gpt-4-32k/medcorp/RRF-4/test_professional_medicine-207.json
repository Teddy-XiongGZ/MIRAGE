    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the body undergoes several physiological changes to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients in the working muscles. One of these changes is an increase in heart rate, which is reflected in the scenario where the average pulse of the men increases to 175/min. This increase in heart rate is accompanied by an increase in stroke volume, the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each beat, to increase cardiac output. This is necessary to deliver more oxygenated blood to the working muscles. Therefore, stroke volume (Choice B) is not likely to decrease during exercise. Similarly, systolic blood pressure (Choice C), the pressure in the arteries during the contraction of the heart muscle, typically increases during exercise to help deliver more blood to the body. Pulse pressure (Choice A), the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, would also not decrease as both systolic and diastolic blood pressures tend to increase with exercise. Total peripheral resistance (Choice D), on the other hand, decreases during exercise. This is because the blood vessels in the working muscles dilate to allow for increased blood flow. This dilation decreases the resistance to blood flow, or total peripheral resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
