    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. Looking at the options, option A suggests a fall in the cell concentration of ADP. However, ADP is a product of ATP breakdown, and its concentration would likely increase, not decrease, during high intensity exercise. Option B suggests inhibition of ATP production. While this could contribute to fatigue, it is not the primary cause. ATP production may slow down, but it does not typically stop completely during high intensity exercise. Option D suggests lack of skill. While skill can affect performance, it is not a fundamental cause of physiological fatigue. Option C suggests failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. This aligns with the information in the documents, which suggest that during high intensity exercise, the demand for ATP (the body's main source of energy) exceeds the supply, leading to fatigue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
