    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spastic paraplegia is a form of paraplegia defined by spasticity of the affected muscles, rather than flaccid paralysis, as stated in Document [0] and Document [2]. This rules out option D. Document [22] mentions that balance impairments are common in patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia, which could suggest proprioceptive loss, making option B a possibility. Document [18] mentions that spastic paraplegia can be caused by multiple sclerosis, making option A a possibility. However, coordination in the legs being affected is not explicitly mentioned in the documents, making option C less likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
