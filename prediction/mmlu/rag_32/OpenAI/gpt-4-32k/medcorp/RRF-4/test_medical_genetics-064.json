    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Male-to-male transmission refers to a trait being passed from father to son. This rules out X-linked inheritance, as males pass their X chromosome to their daughters and their Y chromosome to their sons. Therefore, the trait cannot be X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive. Between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive, both can involve male-to-male transmission. However, the key feature of autosomal dominant inheritance is that the trait can be passed from an affected father to his son, which aligns with the concept of male-to-male transmission.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Autosomal dominant\"}"
