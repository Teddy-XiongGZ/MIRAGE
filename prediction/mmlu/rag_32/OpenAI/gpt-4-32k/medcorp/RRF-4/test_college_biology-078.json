    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The activity of an enzyme is influenced by the pH of the environment. This is because the pH can affect the ionization of the functional groups on the enzyme and substrate, which can in turn affect the enzyme's ability to bind to the substrate and catalyze the reaction. If the activity of an enzyme is constant over a broad range of pH values, it suggests that the ionization of the functional groups on the enzyme and substrate is not significantly affected by changes in pH. This would be the case if there are no ionizing groups on the enzyme or substrate that participate in the reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
