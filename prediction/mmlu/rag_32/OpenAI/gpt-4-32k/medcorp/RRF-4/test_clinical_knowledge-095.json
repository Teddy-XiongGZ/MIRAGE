    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the correct way to assess a patient's breathing. Option A suggests removing dentures, but there is no information in the documents suggesting that dentures should always be removed during a breathing assessment. Option B suggests looking for chest movements and using a mirror to check for exhaled air. While looking for chest movements is a part of the assessment, using a mirror is not mentioned in the documents. Option C suggests looking for chest movements, listening for breath sounds, and feeling for exhaled air on your cheek. This aligns with the information in the documents, particularly Document [4] which mentions evaluating the patient's general appearance, patency of the airway and work of breathing, and includes inspection, palpation, and auscultation. Option D suggests assessing for 30 seconds, but there is no specific time frame mentioned in the documents. Therefore, option C seems to be the most comprehensive and accurate method for assessing a patient's breathing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
