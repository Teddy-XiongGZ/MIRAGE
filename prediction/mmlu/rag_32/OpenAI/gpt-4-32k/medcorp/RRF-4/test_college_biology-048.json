    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a marine ecosystem region where solar radiation can penetrate and nutrients can upwell. From the documents, we know that solar radiation can only penetrate the upper layers of the ocean, where photosynthesis can occur. This is referred to as the photic or euphotic zone. Upwelling, on the other hand, is a process where nutrients from the deep ocean are brought to the surface. This usually happens along the coastlines or in certain open ocean areas. The neritic zone, which extends from the low tide mark to the edge of the continental shelf, fits this description. It is shallow enough for sunlight to penetrate, allowing photosynthesis to occur, and it is also a region where upwelling can occur, bringing nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
