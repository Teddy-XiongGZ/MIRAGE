    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tricarboxylic acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, is a series of chemical reactions that generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA. According to Document [16], one turn of the cycle produces one GTP, which can be converted to ATP, three NADH, one FADH2, and two CO2. Therefore, one complete turn of the cycle produces 2 CO2 and 1 ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 2CO2 and 1ATP\"}"
