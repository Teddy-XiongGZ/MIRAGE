    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy expenditure can be calculated from the oxygen consumption using the conversion factor of 1 L O2 = 21 kJ. Therefore, if the oxygen consumption is 3.0 L/min for 5 minutes, the total oxygen consumption is 3.0 L/min * 5 min = 15 L. Multiplying this by the conversion factor gives the total energy expenditure: 15 L * 21 kJ/L = 315 kJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
