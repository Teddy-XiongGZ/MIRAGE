    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking which statement about embryonic cleavage is not true. Step 2: Review each choice individually and cross-reference with the provided documents. Choice A: Document [12] mentions that cleavage is impeded in the vegetal pole due to the presence of yolk, which supports the statement that the presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. Choice B: Document [12] also mentions that meroblastic cleavage occurs in animals whose eggs have more yolk, which supports the statement that Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. Choice C: This statement contradicts the information in Document [12], which states that cleavage is impeded in the vegetal pole, suggesting that the animal pole undergoes cleavage more readily. Choice D: Document [17] and [21] mention that the embryo divides every 12 to 24 hours to create smaller individual cells known as blastomeres, which supports the statement that the rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. Step 3: Based on the cross-referencing, Choice C is the statement that is not true according to the provided documents. The output in json will be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each choice individually and cross-referenced with the provided documents. Based on the information in the documents, Choice C contradicts the information provided, making it the statement that is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
