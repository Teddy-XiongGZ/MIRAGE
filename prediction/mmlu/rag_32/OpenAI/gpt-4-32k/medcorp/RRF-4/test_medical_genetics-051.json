    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A restriction enzyme that recognizes a specific 4 base sequence in DNA would be expected to cleave the DNA on average once every 256 base pairs, as stated in Document 0. Therefore, to find out how many fragments would be produced from a 5,000 bp bacteriophage genome, we would divide the total number of base pairs by the average cleavage frequency. So, 5000 divided by 256 equals approximately 19.53. This means that the bacteriophage genome would be cleaved into about 20 fragments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
