    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that the frequency of an X-linked recessive disease in males equals q and in females equals q^2. If the incidence in males is 1 in 100, then q equals 1/100 or 0.01. Therefore, the incidence in females would be (0.01)^2 or 0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1 in 10 000\"}"
