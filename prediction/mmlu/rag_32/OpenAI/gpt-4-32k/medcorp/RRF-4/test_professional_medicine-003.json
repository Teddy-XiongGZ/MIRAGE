    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's physical examination findings of a systolic murmur along the left sternal border, weak femoral pulses, radiofemoral delay, and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG are suggestive of coarctation of the aorta. This is a congenital heart disease characterized by a narrowing of the descending aorta, typically just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The narrowing results in higher pressure proximal to the coarctation (eg, upper extremities) and lower pressure distal to it (eg, lower extremities). Over time, the increased afterload can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and eventually heart failure. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for systemic hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
