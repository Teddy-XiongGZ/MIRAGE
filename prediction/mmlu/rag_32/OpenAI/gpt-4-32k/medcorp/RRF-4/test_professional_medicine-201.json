    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's insomnia is characterized by early morning awakening, which is a common form of insomnia in the elderly. The patient's history does not suggest depression, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, or other specific causes of insomnia. His only medication is a bedtime alcoholic drink. Alcohol can help induce sleep but it often disrupts sleep maintenance, causing early morning awakening. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to advise the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol. Reading and snacking in bed can lead to conditioning that bed is a place for activities other than sleep, which can worsen insomnia. Vigorous exercise should be avoided within 1 hour of bedtime because it can interfere with sleep onset. Sertraline is an antidepressant and there is no indication of depression in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
