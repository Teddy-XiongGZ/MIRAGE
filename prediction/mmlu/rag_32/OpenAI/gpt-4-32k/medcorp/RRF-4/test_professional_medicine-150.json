    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has developed bilateral breast enlargement over the past year. His height and weight are at the 50th percentile, which is normal for his age. His physical examination shows normal penis and testes, and Tanner stage 3 pubic hair development, which is also appropriate for his age. His serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. This rules out conditions such as Leydig cell tumor, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome, which would typically present with abnormal hormone levels. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement is normal development, specifically, pubertal gynecomastia, which is a common and benign condition in adolescent boys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Normal development\"}"
