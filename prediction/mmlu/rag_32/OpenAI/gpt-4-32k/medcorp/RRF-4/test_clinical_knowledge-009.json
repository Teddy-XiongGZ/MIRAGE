    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. However, long-chain fatty acids cannot freely diffuse across the mitochondrial membrane. According to the documents, these fatty acids must first be converted to their CoA derivatives in the cytosol. Then, they are transported into the mitochondria bound to carnitine via the carnitine shuttle system. This process involves the enzymes carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II and a transporter protein called carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. carnitine\"}"
