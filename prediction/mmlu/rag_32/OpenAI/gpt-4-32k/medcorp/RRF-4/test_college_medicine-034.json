    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The body compensates for increased environmental temperature by trying to cool itself down. This can be achieved through various mechanisms. According to Document [4], as external temperature rises, the body primarily cools itself through evaporative dissipation of heat. Document [5] also mentions that heat is lost from the skin to the external environment through evaporation. Document [7] further explains that in a warm environment, sweat production will start and provide evaporative cooling. This process involves water being lost through the skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. increasing water lost through skin\"}"
