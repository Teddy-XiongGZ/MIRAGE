    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the option that would not be expected based on the understanding of the role of ZP3 in mouse fertilization. ZP3 is a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida of mouse eggs that acts as a receptor for sperm, initiating the acrosomal reaction necessary for fertilization. Therefore, any interference with the interaction between ZP3 and sperm would be expected to block fertilization. This means that options A, B, and C, which involve blocking the interaction between ZP3 and sperm, would be expected to block in vitro fertilization. On the other hand, option D involves coating synthetic beads with ZP2, a different glycoprotein. Since ZP2 is not the same as ZP3, it would not be expected to initiate the same reaction in sperm. Therefore, it would not be expected to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
