    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pKb value of a base is a measure of the strength of the base. The higher the pKb value, the weaker the base. The pOH of a solution is a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution. The higher the pOH, the lower the concentration of hydroxide ions, and thus the more acidic (or less basic) the solution is. Therefore, for a very weak base, the pKb would be higher than the pOH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
