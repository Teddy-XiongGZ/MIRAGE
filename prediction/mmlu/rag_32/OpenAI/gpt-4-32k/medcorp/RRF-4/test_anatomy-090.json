    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the process of palatal shelf elevation is complex and involves multiple factors. Document [0] suggests that the tongue and mandible facilitate shelf medial movement/growth during shelf elevation. Document [2] suggests that turgor (due to binding of water to mucopolysaccharides) is the intrinsic force which elevates the shelves. Document [19] suggests that rapid and orderly growth of neural, cervical and facial components of the head and neck is an essential requirement for correct palatal shelf elevation. Therefore, it seems that all three processes mentioned in the options play a role in palatine shelf elevation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
