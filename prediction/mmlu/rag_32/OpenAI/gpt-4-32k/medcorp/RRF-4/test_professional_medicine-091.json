    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The statistical power of a study is the probability that it will correctly reject a false null hypothesis, or in other words, the probability that it will detect a true effect if one exists. In this case, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference in effectiveness between Drug X and the standard therapy. The investigators have set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy (Type I error, or alpha) as 1%, and the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same (Type II error, or beta) as 10%. The power of a study is calculated as 1 - beta, so in this case, the power would be 1 - 0.10 = 0.90, or 90%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
