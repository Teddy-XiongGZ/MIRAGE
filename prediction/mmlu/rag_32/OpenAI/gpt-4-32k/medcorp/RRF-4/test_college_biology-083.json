    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ornithine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that plays a role in the urea cycle. It is regenerated with each turn of the urea cycle. In the citric acid cycle, oxaloacetate is regenerated by the reactions of the cycle. Therefore, oxaloacetate is the participant in the citric acid cycle that is regenerated in a similar manner to ornithine in the urea cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Oxaloacetate\"}"
