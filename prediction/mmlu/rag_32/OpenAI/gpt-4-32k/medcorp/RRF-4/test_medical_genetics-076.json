    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Trinucleotide repeat expansion is a type of mutation where repeats of three nucleotides increase in copy numbers until they cross a threshold above which they become unstable. This can lead to various genetic disorders. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, not by trinucleotide repeat expansion. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, not by trinucleotide repeat expansion. Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, not by trinucleotide repeat expansion. Huntington's disease, however, is known to be caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Huntington disease\"}"
