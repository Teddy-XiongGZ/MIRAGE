    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The deamination of branched chain amino acids in muscle leads to the production of ammonia. According to Document [3], the Cahill cycle describes how skeletal muscle deals with the ammonium ions generated in the breakdown of branch chain amino acids. The ammonium is combined with free \u03b1-ketoglutarate via a transamination reaction in the cell, yielding glutamate and \u03b1-keto acid. Alanine aminotransaminase then converts glutamate back into \u03b1-ketoglutarate, transferring the ammonium to pyruvate resulting from glycolysis, forming free alanine. The alanine amino acid acts as a shuttle - it leaves the cell, entering the blood stream and traveling to hepatocytes in the liver, where the process is reversed. Alanine undergoes a transamination reaction with free \u03b1-ketoglutarate to yield glutamate, which is then deaminated to form pyruvate and, ultimately, free ammonium ion. This suggests that the ammonia produced from the deamination of branched chain amino acids in muscle is mostly converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
