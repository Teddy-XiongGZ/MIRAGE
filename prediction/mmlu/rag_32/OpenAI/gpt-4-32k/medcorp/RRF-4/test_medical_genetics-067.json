    "Step 1: Identify the inheritance pattern of each disorder. Step 2: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder, so it shows X-linked inheritance. Step 3: Haemophilia A and Haemophilia B are both X-linked recessive disorders, so they also show X-linked inheritance. Step 4: Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, not an X-linked disorder. Based on these steps, the disorder that does not show X-linked inheritance is Tay-Sachs disease. The answer is B. Tay-Sachs disease. The JSON output is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Identify the inheritance pattern of each disorder.
