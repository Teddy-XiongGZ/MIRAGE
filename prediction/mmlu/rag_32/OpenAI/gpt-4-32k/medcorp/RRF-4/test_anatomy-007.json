    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The human body has several defense mechanisms against environmental bacteria. Document [0] mentions non-specific defenses such as antibacterial substances, phagocytic cells, and the washing action of fluids such as saliva and urine. Document [1] also mentions both innate and adaptive immune responses that counteract the action of pathogens. Document [4] mentions the skin as a physical barrier preventing pathogens from invading internal tissues and digestive enzymes that destroy microbes that enter the stomach with food. Among the options, hair in the nose can trap particles, including bacteria, but it is not mentioned in the documents. Osteoblasts are cells that synthesize bone, not a defense mechanism against bacteria. Mucous membranes and saliva are both mentioned as part of the body's defense mechanisms. However, mucous membranes are a more comprehensive defense mechanism as they line various parts of the body (such as the nose, mouth, and lungs) and produce mucus which can trap bacteria. Therefore, the best answer is mucous membranes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
