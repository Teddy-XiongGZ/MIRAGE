    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder. The mother is a carrier of the disease as her father had hemophilia. This means she has one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome with the hemophilia mutation. The fetus is male, as indicated by the XY karyotype. Males only have one X chromosome, which they inherit from their mothers. Therefore, the fetus has a 50% chance of inheriting the X chromosome with the hemophilia mutation from his mother. If he inherits this chromosome, he will have hemophilia because he doesn't have a second X chromosome to potentially carry a normal copy of the gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
