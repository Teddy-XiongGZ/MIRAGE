    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Monoclonal antibodies are produced by a single B-cell clone and recognize a single epitope on an antigen, as stated in Document [2] and Document [26]. On the other hand, polyclonal antibodies are produced by multiple B-cell clones and recognize multiple epitopes on an antigen, as mentioned in Document [2] and Document [12]. Therefore, the distinguishing factor between monoclonal and polyclonal antisera is the diversity of B-cell clones that produce the antibodies and the number of epitopes they recognize.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
