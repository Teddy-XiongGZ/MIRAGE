    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Positional cloning is a method of gene identification in which a gene for a specific phenotype is identified only by its approximate chromosomal location. This method uses exact chromosomal location instead of function to guide gene identification. This process is initiated by mapping the responsible gene to its location on a chromosome linked to the disease. Successive cloning of the region results in the isolation of candidate genes. Finally, identification of mutations by mutational analysis points to the correct gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
