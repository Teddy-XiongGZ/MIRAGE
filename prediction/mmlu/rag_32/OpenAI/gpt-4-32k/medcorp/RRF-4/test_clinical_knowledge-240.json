    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy expenditure can be calculated using the conversion factor of 1 L of oxygen uptake equals 21.1 kJ of energy. Therefore, the energy expenditure for 5 minutes of exercise with an oxygen uptake of 3.0 L/min would be 3.0 L/min * 5 min * 21.1 kJ/L = 318 kJ. However, this option is not available in the choices. The closest option is 300 kJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
