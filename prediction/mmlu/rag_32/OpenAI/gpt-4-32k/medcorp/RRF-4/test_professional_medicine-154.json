    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a palpable thyroid nodule that is confirmed by ultrasonography. The size of the nodule is 1 cm. According to Document [2], further evaluation with ultrasound is required for patients less than 35 years old with nodules measuring more than 1 cm in the axial plane. The cutoff size for further evaluation is raised to 1.5 cm for patients more than 35 years old. Since the patient is 40 years old and the nodule is 1 cm, it does not meet the criteria for further evaluation. However, considering the patient's age and the solid nature of the nodule, it would be prudent to perform a fine-needle aspiration to rule out malignancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule\"}"
