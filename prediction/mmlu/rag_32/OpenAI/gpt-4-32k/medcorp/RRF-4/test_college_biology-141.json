    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport in plants involves proton pumps. Proton pumps are a type of protein that use energy to move protons across a membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient is then used to drive various cellular processes. In the case of phloem loading, the proton gradient is used to power the co-transport of sucrose into the phloem. This process is not passive, as it requires energy in the form of ATP to function. It does not directly depend on DNA, although the genes encoding the proteins involved are of course encoded in the plant's DNA. Finally, the process does not involve the translocation of starch, but rather of sucrose, a different type of sugar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
