    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the mapping of human chromosomes in detail. They do not mention any restrictions to the sex chromosomes due to small family sizes, so option A is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect as the number of linkage groups is not mentioned to be twice the number of chromosomes. Option D is not supported by the documents as they do not state that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes. However, option B is supported by the documents. They discuss the use of DNA markers, genetic maps, physical maps, and other techniques to successfully map human chromosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
