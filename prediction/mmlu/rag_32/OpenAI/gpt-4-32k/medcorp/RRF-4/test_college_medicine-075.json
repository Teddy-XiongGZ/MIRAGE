    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are mentioned in several documents. According to Document [0], SARMs are a novel class of androgen receptor ligands that were discovered as an alternative to androgenic-anabolic steroids, aiming to have similar effects but with more selectivity in their action. Document [1] further explains that none of the SARMs developed are truly selective for anabolic effects in muscle or bone tissues without producing any androgenic effects in tissues such as the prostate gland. Document [3] describes SARMs as small molecule drugs that function as either androgen receptor (AR) agonists or antagonists. Document [12] mentions that SARMs are nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators. From these documents, it is clear that SARMs are non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors, mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
