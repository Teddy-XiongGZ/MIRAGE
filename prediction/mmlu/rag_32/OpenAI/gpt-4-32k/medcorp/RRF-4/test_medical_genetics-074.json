    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the advantages of using adenoviruses for gene therapy. Step 2: Review the answer choices. The choices are: long term expression, low risk of insertional mutagenesis, low immunogenecity, and easy assembly. Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the genetic material of adenoviruses is not incorporated into the host cell's genetic material, which suggests a low risk of insertional mutagenesis. Document [1] mentions that adenoviruses are the most efficient gene delivery system in a broad range of cell and tissue types, which could suggest easy assembly. However, it does not mention long term expression or low immunogenecity as advantages. Step 4: Choose the answer that is best supported by the documents. Based on the information in the documents, the best answer is \"low risk of insertional mutagenesis.\" Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the advantages of using adenoviruses for gene therapy.
