    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malonyl-CoA is a key molecule in fatty acid metabolism. According to Document [1], malonyl-CoA is a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), which is responsible for the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. Therefore, an increase in malonyl-CoA concentration would inhibit fatty acid oxidation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
