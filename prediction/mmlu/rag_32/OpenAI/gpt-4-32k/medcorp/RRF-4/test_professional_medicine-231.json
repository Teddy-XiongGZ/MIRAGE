    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a young woman with a history of intravenous drug use, presenting with fever and a systolic heart murmur. These symptoms suggest the possibility of infective endocarditis, a common condition among intravenous drug users. In infective endocarditis, the intensity of the murmur typically increases with expiration, not inspiration. This is because expiration increases the pressure in the left side of the heart, causing more blood to be ejected through the affected valve and thus intensifying the murmur. Therefore, the answer should be the option that mentions an increase in the intensity of the murmur with expiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
