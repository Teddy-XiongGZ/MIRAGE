    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Keystone species are defined as having a disproportionate impact on their community relative to their abundance. They play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological community, affecting many other organisms in an ecosystem. The removal of a keystone species can result in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alter trophic dynamics and other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species. Keystone species can prevent a single species from becoming dominant, thus maintaining biodiversity. Therefore, the answer is that keystone species can prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
