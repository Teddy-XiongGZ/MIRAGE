    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a stillborn male infant with oligohydramnios and absence of a urethral opening, which suggests a urinary tract obstruction. Oligohydramnios is a condition characterized by a deficiency of amniotic fluid. It can occur due to various reasons, one of which is urinary tract obstruction in the fetus, which prevents the normal flow of urine into the amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid is crucial for the normal development of the lungs. Therefore, in cases of oligohydramnios, the lungs do not develop properly, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia. The other options like congenital diaphragmatic hernia, intralobar sequestration, and situs inversus are not typically associated with oligohydramnios and urinary tract obstruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pulmonary hypoplasia\"}"
