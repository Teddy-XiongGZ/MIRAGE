    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a laboratory finding that would support the hypothesis that stress from studying for exams is making students more susceptible to infection. Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to increased cortisol production. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid that has immunosuppressive effects, including decreased activity of immune cells like macrophages. Therefore, a decrease in macrophage activity would be expected in a state of stress and could contribute to increased susceptibility to infection. On the other hand, cortisol does not typically cause a decrease in AM serum cortisol concentration, or an increase in basophil or lymphocyte count.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decreased macrophage activity\"}"
