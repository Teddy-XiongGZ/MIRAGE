    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lateral excursion of the mandible refers to the side-to-side movement of the lower jaw. According to Document [0], the lateral and medial pterygoid muscles are more responsible for lateral excursion than are masseter and temporal muscles. In particular, the contralateral lateral pterygoid muscle plays a major role, followed by the contralateral medial pterygoid muscle. In the context of a right lateral excursion, the contralateral side would be the left, so the left lateral pterygoid muscle would be the most active.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
