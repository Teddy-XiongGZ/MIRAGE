    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a principle in population genetics that describes the genetic variation in a population will remain constant from one generation to the next in the absence of disturbing factors. The assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium include a large population size, random mating, and absence of selection, as stated in documents [3], [17], and [20]. However, genetic drift, which is a random change in allele frequencies that occurs in small populations, is not an assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In fact, genetic drift can cause deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as it can lead to changes in allele frequencies over time, as mentioned in document [12].\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
