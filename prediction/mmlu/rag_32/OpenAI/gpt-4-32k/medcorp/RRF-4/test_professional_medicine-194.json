    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's seizure was terminated by diazepam, but she then developed respiratory insufficiency. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine, can cause respiratory depression by suppressing the central respiratory drive, especially when given in high doses or rapidly. The patient received two doses of diazepam in a short period of time, which could have led to an overdose. Encephalitis and meningitis can cause seizures, but they would not directly cause the acute respiratory depression seen in this patient. Airway occlusion could cause respiratory insufficiency, but there is no indication of this in the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
