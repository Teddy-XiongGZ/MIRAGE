    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [2] states that aerobic energy supply dominates the total energy requirements after approximately 75 seconds of near maximal effort. Document [10] suggests that anaerobic supply was the principal contributor during the initial stage of exercise, but that aerobic supply gradually took over. In 60 seconds anaerobic supply ceased, and aerobic supply became the principal contributor. Both these documents suggest that the transition from anaerobic to aerobic occurs around 60-75 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1 minute\"}"
