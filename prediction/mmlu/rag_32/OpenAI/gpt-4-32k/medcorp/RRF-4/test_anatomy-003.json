    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ectomesenchyme is a type of mesenchyme that arises from neural crest cells. According to Document [0], ectomesenchyme plays a critical role in the formation of the hard and soft tissues of the head and neck such as bones, muscles, teeth and, notably, the pharyngeal arches. Document [1] also mentions that dentin and dental pulp are formed from ectomesenchyme. However, none of the options provided in the question are mentioned in the documents as being derived from ectomesenchyme. Motor neurons and melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells, but not specifically from ectomesenchyme. Skeletal muscles are derived from mesoderm, not ectomesenchyme. Sweat glands are derived from the ectoderm, not ectomesenchyme.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
