    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Recombination is a process that ensures the correct segregation of chromosomes to gametes during meiosis. This process involves the pairing of homologous chromosomes and the exchange of genetic information between them. According to Document [1], the initiation of meiotic recombination is associated with the formation of double-strand DNA breaks. Document [22] also mentions that the meiotic recombination checkpoint ensures that meiotic recombination occurs in every pair of homologs during prophase I. Therefore, recombination occurs in prophase I of meiosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
