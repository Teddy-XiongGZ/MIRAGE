    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of renal calculus with calcium as the primary cation and a 24-hour urine collection shows increased calcium excretion, indicating hypercalciuria. Hypercalciuria is a condition characterized by excessive calcium in the urine, which can lead to the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this condition is a thiazide diuretic, which is a Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor. Thiazide diuretics reduce calcium excretion by increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule, thus reducing the risk of stone formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
