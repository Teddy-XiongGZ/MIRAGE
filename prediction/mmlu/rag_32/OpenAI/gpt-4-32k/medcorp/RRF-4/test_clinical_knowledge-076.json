    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stroke volume is regulated by three main factors. According to Document [1] and Document [4], these factors are preload, contractility, and afterload. Preload is the passive ventricular wall stress at the end of diastole and is proportional to the end-diastolic volume. Contractility is the force of myocyte contraction, referred to as the heart's inotropy. Afterload represents all the factors that contribute to total tension during isotonic systolic contraction. Therefore, the answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
