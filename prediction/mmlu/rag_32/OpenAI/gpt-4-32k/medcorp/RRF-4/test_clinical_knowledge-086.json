    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide a specific frequency for assessing wound drainage. However, it is mentioned that wound drainage systems should be monitored frequently and that the volume of drainage should be measured and recorded every 6-8 hours. This suggests that the assessment should be more frequent than daily, but does not necessarily need to be every hour. The choice of only when the wound dressing is changed seems too infrequent, considering the importance of monitoring the drainage system. Therefore, the most reasonable choice seems to be each time post-operative observations are undertaken, as this would likely be a regular and frequent occurrence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
