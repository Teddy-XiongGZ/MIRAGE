In this case, the engineers are testing whether the pilot can detect the light from a mile away. The light is present (the signal), but the pilot reports that he cannot see it. This means the pilot failed to detect the signal, which in terms of Signal Detection Theory is called a 'miss'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
