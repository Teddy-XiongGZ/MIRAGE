    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in controlling the cell cycle and preventing cancer formation. When DNA damage is detected, the p53 protein halts the cell cycle in the G1 phase to allow for DNA repair. If the damage is irreparable, p53 triggers apoptosis to prevent the propagation of potentially cancerous cells. Therefore, a mutation in the p53 gene that leads to an inactive gene product would most likely result in a defect in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
