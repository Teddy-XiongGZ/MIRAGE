    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, and hypertension following cocaine use is suggestive of cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Cocaine inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin at the presynaptic nerve terminal, leading to an excess of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The excess norepinephrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction. Cocaine also stimulates the release of norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, leading to tachycardia and hypertension. Beta blockers, such as metoprolol and carvedilol, are contraindicated in this setting because they can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation and worsen coronary vasospasm. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is not indicated in this case as the patient does not have signs of fluid overload. Phentolamine, a nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist, can be used to counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phentolamine\"}"
