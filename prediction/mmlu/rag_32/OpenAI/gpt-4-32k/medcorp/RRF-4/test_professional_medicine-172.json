    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman has a single gene deletion, which means she is a silent carrier of alpha-thalassemia. The man has a two-gene deletion in trans, which means he has alpha-thalassemia minor. When a person with a single gene deletion (silent carrier) has a child with a person with a two-gene deletion (alpha-thalassemia minor), there is a 25% chance that their child will inherit the two-gene deletion. This is because each parent contributes one gene to the child, and there is a 50% chance that each parent will pass on the deleted gene. Therefore, the chance that both parents will pass on the deleted gene is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, or 25%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
