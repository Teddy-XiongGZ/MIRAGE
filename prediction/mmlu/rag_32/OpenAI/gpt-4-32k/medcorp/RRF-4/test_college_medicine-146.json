    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ATP store in muscle is small and can only support a few contractions if not replenished. This is mentioned in Document [0]. However, the exact duration is not specified in this document. Document [9] mentions that the ATP restoration only lasts for approximately the first 30 seconds of exercise. This suggests that the ATP store can supply energy for about 30 seconds. However, the question asks for the duration in high intensity exercise. Document [6] mentions that the PCr system, which utilizes ATP, lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity. This suggests that the ATP store can supply energy for about 10 to 30 seconds in high intensity exercise. However, this is a range and does not match the answer choices exactly. Document [14] mentions that the ATP-CP system is used for up to 10 seconds. This suggests that the ATP store can supply energy for about 10 seconds in high intensity exercise. This matches one of the answer choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 10 seconds.\"}"
