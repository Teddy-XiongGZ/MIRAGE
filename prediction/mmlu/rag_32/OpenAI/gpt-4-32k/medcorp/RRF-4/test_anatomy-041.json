    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The muscles of the soft palate include the palatoglossus, palatopharyngeus, tensor veli palatini, musculus uvulae, and levator veli palatini muscles. According to Document [0], the levator veli palatini and palatopharyngeus are innervated by branches of the lesser palatine nerve and pharyngeal plexus, and the musculus uvulae is innervated by only the lesser palatine nerve. Document [2] and Document [3] state that these muscles are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus via the vagus nerve, with the exception of the tensor veli palatini, which is innervated by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Therefore, the muscles of the soft palate are innervated by branches of the trigeminal and vagus nerves.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. trigeminal and vagus nerves.\"}"
