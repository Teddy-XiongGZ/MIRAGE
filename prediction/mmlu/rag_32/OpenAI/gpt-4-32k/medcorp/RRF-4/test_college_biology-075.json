    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The kingdom Protista includes organisms that are eukaryotic, meaning they have cells with a nucleus. This is mentioned in several documents, including Document [1] and Document [3]. Cyanobacteria, on the other hand, are prokaryotic and are not included in the kingdom Protista, as mentioned in Document [13]. Protists can be either heterotrophic (obtaining nutrients from organic sources) or autotrophic (capable of synthesizing their own food), so saying they are heterotrophic is not entirely accurate. Lastly, peptidoglycan is a component of bacterial cell walls, not protist cell walls.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
