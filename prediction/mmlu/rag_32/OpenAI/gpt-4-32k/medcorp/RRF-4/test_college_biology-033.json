    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking for a characteristic that is NOT typical of r-selected species. Step 2: Review the documents for information about r-selected species. Step 3: From Document [0], we learn that r-selected species have high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Step 4: Document [1] describes r-selected species as \"opportunistic\" and able to change population sizes rapidly. Step 5: Document [3] mentions that r-selected species have high fecundity, small body size, early maturity onset, short generation time, and the ability to disperse offspring widely. Step 6: Document [4] states that r-selected species colonize open areas quickly and can dominate landscapes that have been recently cleared by disturbance. Step 7: Document [6] mentions that r-selected species emphasize high growth rates, typically exploit less-crowded ecological niches, and produce many offspring, each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood. Step 8: Document [7] states that r-selected organisms usually mature rapidly, have a relatively short lifespan, have a large number of offspring at a time, and have a high mortality rate and a low offspring survival rate. Step 9: Document [16] mentions that r-selected species exploit empty niches, and produce many offspring, each of whom has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood. Step 10: Document [25] mentions that r-selected traits include large breeds of offspring, short life span, small body structure, low adult investment in rearing offspring, and high dispersal ability. Step 11: From the information gathered, we can see that r-selected species typically have a high reproductive rate (Choice A), small body size (Choice B), and occupy unstable environments (Choice C). Step 12: However, there is no mention of r-selected species having high competitive ability (Choice D). In fact, Document [1] and Document [6] suggest that r-selected species are not strong competitors. Therefore, the answer is Choice D. Final Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first understood the question and then reviewed the documents for information about r-selected species. I found that r-selected species typically have a high reproductive rate, small body size, and occupy unstable environments. However, there is no mention of r-selected species having high competitive ability. In fact, some documents suggest that r-selected species are not strong competitors. Therefore, the answer is Choice D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
