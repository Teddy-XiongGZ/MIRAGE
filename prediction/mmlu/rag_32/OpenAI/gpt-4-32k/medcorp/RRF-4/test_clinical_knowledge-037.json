    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the substance that releases the most energy when completely oxidised in the body. Oxidation is a process that involves the loss of electrons, and in the body, it's often associated with the breakdown of nutrients to produce energy. The substances listed are glucose (a carbohydrate), palmitic acid (a fatty acid), leucine (an amino acid), and alcohol. In general, fats provide more energy per gram than carbohydrates or proteins. Therefore, palmitic acid, a type of fat, should release the most energy when completely oxidised.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
