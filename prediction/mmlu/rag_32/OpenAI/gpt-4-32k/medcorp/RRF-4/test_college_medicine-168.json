    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the blood glucose concentration can both rise and fall during high intensity exercise, but it does not typically fall to hypoglycemic levels. Document [0] suggests that blood glucose levels can decline during high intensity exercise, but also mentions an increase in glucose levels after such exercise. Document [1] also mentions that individuals with Type 1 diabetes can experience hyperglycemia during high intensity exercise. Document [2] suggests that the decline in blood glucose levels is less with high intensity exercise compared to moderate exercise. Document [11] suggests that blood glucose levels can increase after high intensity exercise. Document [18] suggests that high intensity exercise can lead to hyperglycemia. Document [22] suggests that high intensity exercise can lead to an increase in blood glucose levels. Document [29] suggests that high intensity exercise can lead to an increase in blood glucose levels. Therefore, the answer is likely that blood glucose concentration frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
