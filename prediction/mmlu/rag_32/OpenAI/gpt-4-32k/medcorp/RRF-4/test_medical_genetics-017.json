    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that about 20,000 human proteins have been annotated in databases such as Uniprot. Document [1] also mentions that the total number of protein-coding genes was revised down to ~20,000. Document [2] suggests that the available data are converging to a basal protein-coding gene number well below 30,000, which could even be as low as 25,000. Document [5] mentions that the count of recognized protein-coding genes dropped to 19,000-20,000. Therefore, the current estimate of human protein-coding genes is between 19,000 and 20,000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
