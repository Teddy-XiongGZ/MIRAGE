    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Evolution is defined as the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. This means that for evolution to occur, there must be a change in the frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool over successive generations. This change does not occur during an organism's lifetime, but rather from one generation to the next. Therefore, the statement that must be true for evolution to have occurred is that the frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
