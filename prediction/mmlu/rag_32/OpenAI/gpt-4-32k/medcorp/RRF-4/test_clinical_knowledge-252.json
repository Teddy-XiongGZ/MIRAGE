    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is transported into the muscle cell via protein transporters, as mentioned in multiple documents. Document [0] and Document [2] specifically mention GLUT4 as the transporter that moves glucose into the muscle cell. Insulin stimulates this process, but glucose can still be transported into the muscle cell in the absence of insulin, such as during exercise, as mentioned in Document [22]. Therefore, the statement that glucose is transported only in the presence of insulin is incorrect. Hexokinase, mentioned in Document [3], is involved in the phosphorylation of glucose within the muscle, not its transport. Monocarbylic acid transporters are not mentioned in the context of glucose transport into muscle cells in any of the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
