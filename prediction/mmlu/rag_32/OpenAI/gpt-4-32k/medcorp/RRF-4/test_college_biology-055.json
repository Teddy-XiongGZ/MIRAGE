    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The gray crescent in amphibian embryos is a region that is crucial for the establishment of the body axes and the future dorsal side of the embryo. It is typically bisected during the first cleavage, resulting in both blastomeres containing part of the gray crescent. If the first cleavage plane is manipulated so that the gray crescent is contained in only one of the two blastomeres, and the two blastomeres are then separated, the blastomere with the gray crescent should still be able to develop normally because it contains the necessary components for body axis formation. The blastomere without the gray crescent, however, may not be able to form a complete embryo because it lacks these crucial components.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
