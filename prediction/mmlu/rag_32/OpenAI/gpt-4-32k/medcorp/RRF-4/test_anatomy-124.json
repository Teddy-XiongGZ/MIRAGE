    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking about the location from which parasympathetic preganglionic axons exit the central nervous system (CNS). Step 2: Review the relevant documents. Document [4] states that the preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system leave the CNS in the third, seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves as well as the second and third sacral nerves. Document [10] also mentions that the preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system come from the sacral spinal cord (specifically S2-S4). Document [17] also mentions that in the parasympathetic portion of the ANS, preganglionic cells originate in the craniosacral system, which includes S2 to S4 of the sacral spinal cord. Step 3: Choose the correct answer. Based on the information from the documents, the parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the CNS with the sacral spinal nerves. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location from which parasympathetic preganglionic axons exit the central nervous system (CNS).
