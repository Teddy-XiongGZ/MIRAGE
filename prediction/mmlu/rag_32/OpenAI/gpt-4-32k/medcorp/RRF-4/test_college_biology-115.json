    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A competitive inhibitor works by competing with the substrate for the same binding site on the enzyme. This means that the inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time. This type of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of the substrate. Therefore, the competitive inhibitor does not irreversibly form covalent links with the enzyme or irreversibly modify the enzyme's active site. It also does not bind to a different site than the substrate. The competitive inhibitor does not decrease the number of enzyme molecules available to bind substrates, but it does decrease the number of enzyme molecules that are able to bind substrates due to the competition for the binding site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
