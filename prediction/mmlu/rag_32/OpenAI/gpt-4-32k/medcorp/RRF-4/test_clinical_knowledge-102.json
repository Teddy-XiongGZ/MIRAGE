    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the solution to be used for bladder washout in case of a blocked catheter post-transurethral resection of the prostate. Document [17] suggests that postoperative irrigation fluid should be with normal saline, particularly after monopolar surgery. Document [28] also mentions maintaining the irrigation fluid at the minimum height necessary to provide adequate visualization. Document [30] conducted a study comparing epsilon aminocaproic acid and normal saline for postoperative bladder irrigation following transurethral resection of the prostate and found no significant advantage for the epsilon aminocaproic acid solution over normal saline irrigation in measured postoperative blood loss, irrigant volume, hours of catheterization, or length of hospital stay. Therefore, normal saline seems to be the most appropriate solution for bladder washout.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
