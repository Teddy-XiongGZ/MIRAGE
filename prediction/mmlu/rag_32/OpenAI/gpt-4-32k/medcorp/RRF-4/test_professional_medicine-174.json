    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of recurrent injuries, chest pain with exertion, and joint hypermobility, along with a family history of aortic aneurysm, suggests a connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by abnormalities in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. Skeletal manifestations include tall stature, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, and scoliosis. Ocular manifestations include myopia and lens dislocation. Cardiovascular manifestations include mitral valve prolapse, which can cause a midsystolic click, and aortic root dilatation, which can lead to aortic dissection and rupture. Given the patient's symptoms and family history, it is crucial to evaluate her for cardiovascular involvement, which is the most serious complication of Marfan syndrome and can be life-threatening. Therefore, echocardiography, which can assess for mitral valve prolapse and aortic root dilatation, is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
