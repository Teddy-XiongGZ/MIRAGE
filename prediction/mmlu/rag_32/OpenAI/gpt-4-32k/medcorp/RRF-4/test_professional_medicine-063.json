    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of frequent respiratory infections, daily purulent sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, and infertility suggest a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. This is a genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems, including the respiratory and reproductive systems. The physical examination findings of wheezing and rhonchi, along with the chest x-ray showing hyperinflation and spirometry showing a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio, are consistent with obstructive lung disease, which is common in cystic fibrosis due to thick, sticky mucus blocking the airways. The most definitive diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis is a sweat chloride test, which measures the amount of chloride in the sweat. People with cystic fibrosis have higher than normal levels of chloride in their sweat.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
