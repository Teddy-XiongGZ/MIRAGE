    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema after receiving the influenza vaccine suggest an anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen. Influenza vaccines are produced using egg-based technology, meaning they contain a small amount of egg proteins. Therefore, individuals with a severe egg allergy may have an allergic reaction to the vaccine. If the physician had inquired about an egg allergy prior to administering the vaccine, they could have chosen an egg-free vaccine if available or taken other precautions to prevent this reaction. The other options (B, C, D) are not directly related to preventing an allergic reaction to the influenza vaccine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
