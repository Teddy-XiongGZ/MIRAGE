His physical examination findings of delayed capillary refill and cool extremities indicate poor peripheral perfusion, which is a sign of shock. His low blood pressure and tachycardia are also consistent with shock. The low central venous oxygen saturation suggests inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues, which is another characteristic of shock.
