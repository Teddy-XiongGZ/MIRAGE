    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of low external pH on ATP production in mitochondria. From Document [0], we know that the mitochondrial matrix has an internal pH of around 8.0, which is higher than that of the intermembrane space. This pH discrepancy is necessary to create a gradient across the membrane, which allows for the generation of ATP. Therefore, a low external pH would increase the proton (H+) gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, promoting the diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix. This diffusion is a key part of the process of oxidative phosphorylation, which generates ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
