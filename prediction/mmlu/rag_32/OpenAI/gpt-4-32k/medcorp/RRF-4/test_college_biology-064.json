    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the effect of the transfer of blood from the venous side to the arterial side during the cardiac cycle. The venous side is more compliant, meaning it can expand more easily to accommodate blood, while the arterial side is less compliant. When blood is transferred from the venous side to the arterial side, the venous pressure would decrease due to the reduction in blood volume. On the other hand, the arterial pressure would increase due to the addition of blood volume. However, because the arterial side is less compliant, the increase in pressure would be larger than the decrease in venous pressure. Therefore, the transfer of blood results in little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
