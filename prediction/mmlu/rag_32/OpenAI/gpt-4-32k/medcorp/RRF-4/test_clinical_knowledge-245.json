    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that the anti-diuretic hormones vasopressin (ADH) and aldosterone play a major role in fluid regulation. If the body is becoming fluid-deficient, there will be an increase in the secretion of these hormones, causing fluid to be retained by the kidneys and urine output to be reduced. Document [2] also mentions that antidiuretic hormone, also called arginine vasopressin, regulates the amount of water excreted by the kidneys. Document [5] also mentions that vasopressin, a hormone which causes the retention of water in the kidneys, is released in response to low blood pressure. Therefore, the hormone primarily responsible for fluid regulation is the antidiuretic hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
