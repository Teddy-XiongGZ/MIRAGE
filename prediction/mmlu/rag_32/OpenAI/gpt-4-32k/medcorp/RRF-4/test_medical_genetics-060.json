    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inbreeding coefficient, F, is a measure of the probability of two alleles at any locus in an individual being identical by descent from the common ancestor(s) of the two parents. An increase in the inbreeding coefficient would mean a higher probability of identical alleles, which would result in a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population. The other options do not directly relate to the concept of inbreeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
