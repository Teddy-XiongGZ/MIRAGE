    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle relaxation occurs when the muscle fibers return to a low-tension state. This happens when the nerve stimulus is removed, causing the muscle to stop contracting and start relaxing. The other options do not directly lead to muscle relaxation. A too forceful nerve stimulus would likely cause a stronger contraction, not relaxation. The uncovering or saturation of actin binding sites are related to muscle contraction, not relaxation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
