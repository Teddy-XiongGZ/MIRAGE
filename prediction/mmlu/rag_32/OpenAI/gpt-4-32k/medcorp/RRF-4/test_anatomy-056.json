    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve. This is stated in Document [0]. The infraorbital nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin and mucous membranes around the middle of the face. It does not provide motor supply to any muscles, as stated in Document [4]. Therefore, it does not innervate the inferior part of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The infraorbital nerve is not a branch of the maxillary branch of the facial nerve, and it does not carry parasympathetic secretomotor neurons to the lacrimal gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
