    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retrotransposons are a type of genetic component that copy and paste themselves into different genomic locations. They do this by converting RNA back into DNA through the process of reverse transcription using an RNA transposition intermediate. This process is described in Document [13]. Therefore, the most accurate description of a retrotransposon is a DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
