    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a peripheral motor nerve is cut, it loses its ability to send signals to the muscles it innervates. This means that the muscles will no longer receive the electrical impulses they need to contract and function. Over time, without these signals, the muscles will begin to waste away or atrophy. This is different from spastic paralysis, which is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, and contracture, which is a permanent shortening of a muscle or joint. Flaccid paralysis is a condition characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone, which can be a result of the nerve damage, but the most prominent sign after about 6 months would be muscle atrophy due to lack of use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
