    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tricarboxylic acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, is a series of chemical reactions that generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA. According to Document [16], the products of one turn of the cycle are one GTP (or ATP), three NADH, one FADH2 and two CO2. Therefore, during one complete turn of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 2 molecules of CO2 and 1 molecule of ATP are formed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 2CO2 and 1ATP\"}"
