    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The acceleration of an object on an inclined plane with friction is given by the component of gravity acting down the slope (g sin ?) minus the force of friction. The force of friction is the normal force (which is the component of the object's weight acting perpendicular to the slope, mg cos ?) times the coefficient of friction (\u00b5). Therefore, the acceleration of the object is the gravitational force down the slope minus the force of friction, which simplifies to g (sin ? \u2013 \u00b5 cos ?).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
