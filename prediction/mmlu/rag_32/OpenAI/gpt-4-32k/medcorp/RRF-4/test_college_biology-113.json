    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the point at which the rate of the reaction catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase reaches its maximum. This is the point of saturation, where all the enzyme's active sites are occupied by substrate molecules. In this case, the substrate is acetaldehyde. Therefore, at the maximal rate of reaction, nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
