    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A pleural friction rub is a non-musical, short explosive sound, described as creaking or grating and likened to walking on fresh snow. It is usually localized to a small area of the chest, and may be accentuated by increasing the pressure on the stethoscope. The sound does not change after a bout of coughing. This is in contrast to crackles, which can alter with coughing. Therefore, the feature that suggests a crackling sound is more likely due to a pleural friction rub than crackles is that it does not alter with coughing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
