    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the processes that are not used to modify protein structure after translation. From the documents, we know that lipidation, glycosylation, and phosphorylation are all post-translational modifications that can occur to proteins. Lipidation is mentioned in Document [27], glycosylation in Document [1], and phosphorylation in Document [12]. However, the attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is a process that occurs during translation, not after. This is mentioned in Document [10], which states that the basic process of protein production is the addition of one amino acid at a time to the end of a protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
