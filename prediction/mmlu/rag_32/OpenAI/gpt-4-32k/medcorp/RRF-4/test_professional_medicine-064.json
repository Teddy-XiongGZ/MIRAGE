    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a condition characterized by increased blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It can be a complication of pulmonary embolism. The physical examination findings in pulmonary arterial hypertension are related to the increased pressure in the right side of the heart, which pumps blood into the lungs. The most specific sign of pulmonary arterial hypertension is a loud P2, which is the second heart sound produced by the closure of the pulmonary valve. Increased jugular venous pressure and peripheral edema are signs of right heart failure, which can occur as a result of pulmonary arterial hypertension, but they are not specific to this condition. The presence of an S3 is a sign of left ventricular dysfunction, not specifically pulmonary arterial hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
