    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of recurrent severe infections, including osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and pneumonia, along with the current presentation of a liver abscess caused by Staphylococcus aureus, suggests an underlying immunodeficiency. The additional information that the patient's neutrophils fail to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus is key. The oxidative burst is a crucial part of the immune response, in which reactive oxygen species are produced to kill ingested microorganisms. Therefore, the patient's increased susceptibility to infection is due to the inability of his leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
