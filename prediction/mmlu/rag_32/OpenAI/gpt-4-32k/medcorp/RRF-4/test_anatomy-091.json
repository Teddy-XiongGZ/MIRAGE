    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental plaque is a biofilm that attaches to tooth surfaces. It is commonly found between the teeth, on the front of teeth, behind teeth, on chewing surfaces, along the gumline, or below the gumline. According to Document [10], irrespective of gender, subject or arch, anterior teeth harbored lower mean amounts of plaque than posterior teeth. Lingual and molar surfaces consistently harbored large densities of plaque and represented areas with the least plaque removal after toothbrushing. This suggests that plaque is more likely to accumulate on the posterior teeth, particularly the molars, and the lingual surfaces. Therefore, the answer should be either A or B. However, Document [1] indicates that the pattern of plaque accumulation was largely symmetrical, with differences in mean P%I between several adjacent tooth surfaces, e.g. for the maxillary buccal and lingual tooth surfaces between the first and second molars. This suggests that plaque is likely to accumulate on both the buccal and lingual surfaces of the molars. Therefore, the answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
