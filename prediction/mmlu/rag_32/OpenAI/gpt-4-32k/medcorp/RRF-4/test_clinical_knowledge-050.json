    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [25] suggests that flushing once every 24 hours appears to have lower complication rates than those flushed 2 or 3 times a day. However, none of the options provided match this frequency. Document [0] mentions a study where cannulae were flushed regularly but does not specify the frequency. Document [1] discusses the importance of flushing after sampling but does not provide a specific frequency. Document [2] emphasizes the importance of flushing to prevent clots but does not provide a specific frequency. Document [3] suggests that intermittent flushing can improve cannula patency but does not provide a specific frequency. Document [4] suggests that regular flushing can maintain cannula patency for 48 hours but does not provide a specific frequency. Document [5] suggests that intermittent flushing is a safe and viable alternative to continuous infusion but does not provide a specific frequency. Document [6] does not provide information on flushing frequency. Document [7] does not provide information on flushing frequency. Document [8] emphasizes the importance of flushing after medication administration and between different medications but does not provide a specific frequency. Document [9] does not provide information on flushing frequency. Document [10] compares continuous infusion to intermittent flushing but does not provide a specific frequency. Document [11] suggests that intermittent flushing results in longer cannula patency compared to continuous infusion but does not provide a specific frequency.

Document [30] does not provide information on flushing frequency. Document [31] does not provide information on flushing frequency. Based on the available documents, none of the options provided match the suggested frequency of once every 24 hours. However, since the options provided are all less than 24 hours, the closest option to the suggested frequency is every 16 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
