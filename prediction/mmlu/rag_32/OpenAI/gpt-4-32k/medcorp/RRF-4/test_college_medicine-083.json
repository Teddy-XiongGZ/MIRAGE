    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities is likely due to metabolic changes in the muscle. Document [2] mentions that limitations in energy supply, including phosphocreatine hydrolysis and the degree of reliance on anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative metabolism, and the intramuscular accumulation of metabolic by-products, such as hydrogen ions, emerge as key factors responsible for fatigue. Document [6] also mentions that limitations in energy supply, which include energy available from phosphocreatine hydrolysis, anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative metabolism, and the intramuscular accumulation of metabolic by-products, such as hydrogen ions, emerge as key factors responsible for fatigue. Inorganic phosphate is a by-product of phosphocreatine hydrolysis and anaerobic glycolysis, so it could accumulate during multiple sprint activities and contribute to peripheral muscle fatigue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
