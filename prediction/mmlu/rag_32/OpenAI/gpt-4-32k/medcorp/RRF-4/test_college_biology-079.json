    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tall violet plant has the genotype DDWw, which means it is homozygous for the tall trait and heterozygous for the violet color. The dwarf white plant must be ddww, which is homozygous recessive for both traits. When these two plants cross, all offspring will receive a D allele and a d allele for the height trait, making them all heterozygous (Dd) and thus tall because D is dominant. For the color trait, half of the offspring will receive a W allele and a w allele, making them heterozygous (Ww) and thus violet because W is dominant. The other half will receive two w alleles, making them homozygous recessive (ww) and thus white. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
