This correlation is not about merit (academic or otherwise), which rules out option B. It's also not about cultural capital, which is more about knowledge, skills, education, and other cultural assets a person has, so option A is not correct. The correlation doesn't indicate a false association, as it's a positive correlation, so option D is not correct. The correlation is about the value of social connections, which is the definition of social capital. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
