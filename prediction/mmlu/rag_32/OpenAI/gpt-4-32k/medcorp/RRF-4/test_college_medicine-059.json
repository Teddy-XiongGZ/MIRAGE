    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endurance training is associated with aerobic exercise, which involves the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. This type of training typically leads to adaptations in the body that enhance the efficiency of the body's energy utilization. According to Document [0], endurance training leads to an increase in oxidative enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) that enable mitochondria to break down nutrients to form ATP. This suggests that endurance training enhances the muscle's capacity to burn fat and carbohydrates, which are the primary sources of ATP. Document [2] also supports this by stating that endurance exercise training improves the oxidative capacity of the muscles. Therefore, the correct answer is C. break down fat and carbohydrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
