    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation that improve after bowel movements, especially during periods of stress such as preparing for examinations, are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. The patient's normal physical examination and laboratory findings, including endoscopies, support a diagnosis of IBS. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with IBS with constipation (IBS-C). Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion, accelerating small bowel and colonic transit, which can help alleviate constipation. Azathioprine and infliximab are immunosuppressive drugs used in inflammatory bowel disease, not IBS. Mesalamine is an anti-inflammatory drug used in inflammatory bowel disease, not IBS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
