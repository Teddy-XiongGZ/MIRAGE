    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the processes that are not used to modify protein structure after translation. From the documents, we know that lipidation, glycosylation, and phosphorylation are all post-translational modifications that can occur to proteins. However, the attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not a post-translational modification. This process occurs during translation, not after.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
