    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endurance events such as marathon races require the body to maintain a steady supply of energy for a prolonged period of time. This involves efficient oxygen supply to the muscles, which is mentioned in multiple documents such as Document [1] and Document [10]. The ability to regulate body temperature is also crucial in endurance events to prevent overheating, as mentioned in Document [5]. The availability of body stores of carbohydrate is important as it provides the necessary energy for prolonged physical activity, as suggested in Document [4]. However, ATP and phosphocreatine are more related to short, high-intensity activities, providing immediate energy. They are not typically associated with endurance events like marathons, which rely more on aerobic metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
