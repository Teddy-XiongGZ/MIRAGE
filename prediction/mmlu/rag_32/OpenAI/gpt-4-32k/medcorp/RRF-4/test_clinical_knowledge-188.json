    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate limiting enzyme of a biochemical pathway is the enzyme that determines the overall rate of the pathway. In glycolysis, there are three main enzymes that are often considered as rate-limiting: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. However, the most commonly accepted rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis is phosphofructokinase, as it is the enzyme that controls the speed of glycolysis and is subject to the most regulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. phosphofructokinase.\"}"
