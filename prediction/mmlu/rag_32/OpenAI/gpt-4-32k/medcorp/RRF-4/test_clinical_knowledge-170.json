    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bronchial breathing is a type of breath sound. To find the characteristics of bronchial breathing, I need to look for documents that describe the features of this type of breath sound. Document [8] provides a clear description of bronchial breath sounds. According to this document, bronchial breath sounds are loud, hollow, and high pitched sounds. They are normally heard over the sternal manubrium and posterior chest wall due to movement of air through the trachea and large airways. This suggests that bronchial breath sounds are characterized by a louder and longer expiratory component.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration\"}"
