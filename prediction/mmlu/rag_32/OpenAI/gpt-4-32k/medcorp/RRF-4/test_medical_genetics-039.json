    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about how the epigenetic inheritance system has been described. From the documents, it is clear that epigenetic inheritance refers to the transmission of information from one generation to the next that affects the traits of offspring without altering the primary structure of DNA. This is different from genetic inheritance which involves changes in the DNA sequence. Document [6] mentions that hard inheritance is a model of heredity that explicitly excludes any acquired characteristics, such as of Lamarckism. It states that characteristics of an organism's offspring will not be affected by the actions that the parental organism performs during its lifetime. This is the opposite of soft inheritance, which includes acquired characteristics. Therefore, the epigenetic inheritance system has been described as soft inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
