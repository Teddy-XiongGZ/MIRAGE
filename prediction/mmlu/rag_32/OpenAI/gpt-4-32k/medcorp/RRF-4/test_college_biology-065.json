    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the correct statement about the Golgi apparatus of a eukaryote. Step 2: Review each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the documents. Choice A: Document [5] mentions that the cis face of the Golgi stack is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This supports the statement in choice A. Choice B: None of the documents mention small secretory vesicles located near the cis face of the Golgi apparatus. Choice C: Document [3] and [19] discuss the idea of cisternal maturation, which suggests that the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are not continuous with one another but rather mature and change over time. Choice D: Document [22] mentions that glycosylation of proteins occurs in the Golgi apparatus, but it does not specify that this occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen. Step 3: Based on the information from the documents, the correct answer is A.
