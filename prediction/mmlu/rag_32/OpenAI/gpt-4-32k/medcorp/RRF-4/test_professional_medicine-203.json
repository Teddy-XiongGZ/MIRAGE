    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a previously healthy 14-year-old girl who has a history of a recent knee injury while playing soccer. She now presents with fever and signs of inflammation in the right knee, including swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema. These symptoms suggest a possible infection or inflammation in the joint. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an arthrocentesis. This procedure involves the removal of fluid from the joint space for analysis, which can help determine whether the cause of the symptoms is infectious (such as septic arthritis) or inflammatory (such as a post-traumatic or autoimmune arthritis). Other options like nuclear scan or MRI of the right knee might be useful for further evaluation, but they are not the immediate next step. Starting antibiotic therapy without confirming an infection could lead to unnecessary use of antibiotics and potential side effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
