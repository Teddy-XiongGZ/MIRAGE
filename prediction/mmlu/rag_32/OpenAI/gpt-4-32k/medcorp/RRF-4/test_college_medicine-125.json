    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism by which H+ ions return to the inside of the mitochondria. This process is facilitated by ATP synthase, which allows H+ ions to move down their electrochemical gradient from the intermembrane space back into the mitochondrial matrix. This movement of ions down their concentration gradient is a form of passive transport, as it does not require the input of energy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Passive transport\"}"
