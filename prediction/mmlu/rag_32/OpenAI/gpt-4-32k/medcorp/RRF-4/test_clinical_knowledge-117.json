    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about an intracellular buffer that can limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. A buffer is a substance that minimizes changes in pH. From the documents, Document [11] mentions that major intracellular buffer systems include those involving proteins or phosphates. Document [30] also talks about calcium buffers that help stabilize the concentration of ions within cells. However, none of these documents mention the specific substances listed in the answer choices. Document [17] mentions carnosine as an anti-glycating agent, which could potentially act as a buffer. The other options, glutamine, glucose, and amylase, are not mentioned in the context of acting as buffers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Carnosine\"}"
