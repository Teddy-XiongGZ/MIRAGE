    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a lump on her neck, specifically in the lower left lobe of the thyroid. She does not have any symptoms of infection such as tenderness or fever, nor does she have symptoms of thyroid dysfunction such as weight loss or fatigue. This suggests that the lump could be a benign thyroid nodule. The most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion would be to visualize it, which can be done through ultrasonography of the thyroid gland. This can help determine the size, shape, and composition of the nodule, which can guide further management. Fine-needle aspiration could be used later if the ultrasound findings suggest that the nodule could be malignant. Nuclear thyroid scan and iodine131 scan are typically used when hyperthyroidism is suspected, which does not seem to be the case here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
