    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The goal is to ensure that a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways when a patient uses an inhaler. According to Document [0], the ideal inhaler should ensure consistency of the emitted dose and require a low inspiratory airflow for activation. Document [1] also mentions that correct inhalation technique deteriorates over time, so instructions should be given repeatedly to achieve and maintain correct inhalation technique. Document [11] suggests that inhalation manoeuvres through a dry powder inhaler (DPI) should start with a gentle exhalation, away from the inhaler, followed by an immediate forceful inhalation that is as fast as possible and continued for as long as the patient can comfortably achieve. This suggests that holding the breath at the end of the inspiration could help ensure that the drug reaches the lower airways.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
