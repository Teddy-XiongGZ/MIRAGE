    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angiosperms are a group of seed-producing plants also known as flowering plants. From the documents, it is clear that they have several unique characteristics that distinguish them from other plant groups. Wind-borne pollen (Choice A) is not unique to angiosperms as it is also found in gymnosperms. A dominant sporophyte life cycle (Choice B) and alteration of generations (Choice C) are common characteristics of all land plants, not just angiosperms. However, double fertilization (Choice D) is a process unique to angiosperms, as mentioned in Document [3]. In this process, one sperm fertilizes the egg cell to form a zygote, while the other sperm combines with two polar nuclei to form a triploid cell, which develops into the endosperm. This process is not found in other plant groups.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
