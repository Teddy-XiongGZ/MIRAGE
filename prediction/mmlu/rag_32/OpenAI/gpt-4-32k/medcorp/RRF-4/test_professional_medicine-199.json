    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a long history of tremor that has recently worsened. The tremor is not present at rest, which makes Parkinson's disease less likely as it typically presents with a resting tremor. The patient has recently started taking fluoxetine, which can cause tremor as a side effect. However, the patient's tremor was present before starting this medication, making it less likely to be the primary cause of her symptoms. The patient has recently increased her alcohol consumption, which can cause a tremor, but it's noted that the alcohol actually reduces her tremor. The patient has recently experienced the death of her husband, and stress can exacerbate a tremor. Given the patient's long history of tremor that worsens with stress and improves with alcohol, it seems most likely that her symptoms are being exacerbated by her bereavement reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
