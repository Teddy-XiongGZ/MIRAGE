    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the correct statement regarding the growth of the mandible. Let's analyze each option: A. The mental symphysis closes at about 1 year postnatally - There is no information in the documents provided that supports this statement. B. The condylar growth cartilage ceases activity at puberty - Document [5] suggests that growth of the mandibular condyle continues beyond puberty, with peak growth rates for males at approximately 14.3 years and for females at approximately 12.2 years. This suggests that the condylar growth cartilage does not cease activity at puberty. C. The ossification centre appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage - There is no information in the documents provided that supports this statement. D. The functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible is the lateral pterygoid muscle - Document [15] suggests that the functional biomechanical vector of force in the condylar-ascending mandibular ramus complex can affect the subsequent pattern of mandibular relocation. This suggests that the functional matrix, which could include muscles such as the lateral pterygoid, can act on the angle of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
