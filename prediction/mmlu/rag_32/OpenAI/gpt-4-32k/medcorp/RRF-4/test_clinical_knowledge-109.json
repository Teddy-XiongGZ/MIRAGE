    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the standard time limit for a unit of blood to be out of a monitored refrigerator is 30 minutes. However, some studies suggest that this limit could be extended to 2 hours without any increased risk to the recipient. If a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit, it should not be used for transfusion as it may pose a risk to the patient. Therefore, it should be returned to the blood bank with an explanation of why it was returned. It should not be disposed of in the sluice area as this could lead to a loss of valuable blood units. Also, it should not be refrigerated for a minimum of 12 hours and then administered as this could potentially increase the risk of bacterial contamination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
