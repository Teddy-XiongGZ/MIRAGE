    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of translation in biology refers to the synthesis of proteins from messenger RNA (mRNA). This process requires the presence of mRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomes. mRNA carries the genetic information copied from DNA in the form of a series of three-base code words, each of which specifies a particular amino acid. tRNA is the adapter molecule that reads the mRNA codons and brings in the appropriate amino acids. Ribosomes are the sites where protein synthesis occurs, bringing together mRNA and tRNA to assemble the protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
