    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, it is clear that the oxidation of one NADH molecule generates enough energy to produce 3 ATP molecules, while the oxidation of one FADH2 molecule generates enough energy to produce 2 ATP molecules. Therefore, a pair of electrons carried in the form of one NADH and one FADH2 molecule collectively contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate 5 ATP molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
