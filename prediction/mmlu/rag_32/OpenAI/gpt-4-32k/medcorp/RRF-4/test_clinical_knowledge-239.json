    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic metabolism refers to the process of generating ATP in the absence of oxygen. This is evident from the term 'anaerobic' which means 'without oxygen'. This process is used by organisms when oxygen availability is low. It involves the breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen, resulting in the production of ATP. This is clearly stated in Document [1], Document [2], and Document [3]. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that mentions the absence of oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. in the absence of available oxygen.\"}"
