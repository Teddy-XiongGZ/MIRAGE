    "The fundamental niche of a species includes the total range of environmental conditions that are suitable for its existence without the influence of competition or predation from other species. The realized niche, on the other hand, is the range of environmental conditions in which a species is really found, considering the limiting factors such as competition and predation. In this case, the bird species is capable of nesting in both treetops and cliff ledges, which represents its fundamental niche. However, due to the presence of a more aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges, they are only able to utilize the treetops for nesting, which represents their realized niche. So, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The bird species is capable of nesting in both treetops and cliff ledges, which represents its fundamental niche. However, due to the presence of a more aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges, they are only able to utilize the treetops for nesting, which represents their realized niche.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. their realistic niche only\"}"
