    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about how the brain detects differences in stimulus intensity. From the documents, it is clear that the intensity of a stimulus is encoded according to the number of sensory receptors that are activated (Document [11]). A stronger stimulus may recruit many similar receptors, leading to greater activity in central sensory neurons, which may be perceived as a stronger stimulus. This suggests that the number of action potentials per second, which would increase with the activation of more sensory receptors, varies with the stimulus intensity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
