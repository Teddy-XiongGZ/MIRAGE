    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The src oncogene is mentioned in several documents. Document [1] states that the cellular proto-oncogene, c-src, encodes a protein, p60c-src, which has the ability to phosphorylate proteins on tyrosine residues. This suggests that the src oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase, which is a type of enzyme that transfers a phosphate group from ATP to a protein in a cell. Therefore, the answer is D. Tyrosine kinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
