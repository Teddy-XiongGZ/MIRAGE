    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is a primary growth cartilage, not a secondary one, so option A is incorrect. Document [0] suggests that the spheno-occipital synchondrosis influences the growth of the maxilla and mandible, which are parts of the viscerocranium, so option B seems correct. Document [1] and [3] indicate that the spheno-occipital synchondrosis does not cease activity at 7 years of age, but rather continues to be active into adolescence and even up to the mid-twenties, so option C is incorrect. There is no information in the documents provided that suggests the spheno-occipital synchondrosis can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly, so option D is also incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
