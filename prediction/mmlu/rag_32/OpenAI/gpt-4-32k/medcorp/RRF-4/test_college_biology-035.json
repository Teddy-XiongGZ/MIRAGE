    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking about the alternation of generations in ferns, specifically the relationship between the sporophyte and gametophyte stages. Step 2: Review the documents. Document [4] states that in ferns, both the sporophyte and the gametophyte are capable of living independently, but the dominant form is the diploid sporophyte. The haploid gametophyte is much smaller and simpler in structure. Step 3: Match the information from the documents to the answer choices. The information from Document [4] matches with answer choice A: a dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte. Step 4: Confirm the answer. Review the other documents to ensure there is no conflicting information. Document [5] also supports that the sporophyte is the dominant form in ferns and the gametophyte is a free-living organism, further confirming answer choice A. Step 5: Finalize the answer. The answer is A: a dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte. Output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Understand the question.
