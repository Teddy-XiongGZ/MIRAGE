    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue, along with the presence of multiple bilateral tender points in specific muscle groups, are characteristic of fibromyalgia. This is further supported by the fact that radiograph findings and laboratory study results are normal, as fibromyalgia is a clinical diagnosis and is not associated with specific radiographic or laboratory abnormalities. Ankylosing spondylitis typically presents with inflammatory back pain and stiffness, and can have radiographic abnormalities.
