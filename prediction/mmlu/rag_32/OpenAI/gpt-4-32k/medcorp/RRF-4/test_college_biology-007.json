    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Respiration is a source of atmospheric carbon as it converts organic carbon into carbon dioxide and methane, which are typically emitted into the atmosphere (Document [1]). Bacterial decomposition can also contribute to atmospheric carbon by degrading organic acids and producing CO2 (Document [24]). The combustion of fossil fuels is a major source of atmospheric carbon, as it releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (Document [0]). However, photosynthesis is not a source of atmospheric carbon. Instead, it is a process that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converts it into organic compounds (Document [1]).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Photosynthesis\"}"
