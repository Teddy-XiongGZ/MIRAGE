    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resynthesis of phosphocreatine after high-intensity exercise is mentioned in several documents. Document [4] states that full creatine stores are regenerated within five minutes. Document [28] mentions that phosphocreatine recovery half-time was 56.6 seconds. Document [30] states that the initial fast phase of CP resynthesis is limited by the availability of oxygen whereas the subsequent slow phase is limited by the hydrogen ion transport out from the muscle. Considering these documents, it seems that the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise takes about 4 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
