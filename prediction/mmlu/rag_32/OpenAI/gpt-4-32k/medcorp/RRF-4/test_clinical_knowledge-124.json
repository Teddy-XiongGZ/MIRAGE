    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that the stoma should be placed in a location that the patient can easily see and manipulate, within the rectus muscle, and below the belt line. It should be located below the umbilicus, within the rectus muscle, away from scars, creases, bony prominences, umbilicus, and belt line, on the summit of the infraumbilical fat mound, and visible to the patient. It should also ideally avoid the costal margin and umbilicus. Therefore, the stoma should not be within an abdominal crease, next to the umbilicus, or in close proximity to the incision site. The best answer is that it should be in the rectus sheath abdominus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
