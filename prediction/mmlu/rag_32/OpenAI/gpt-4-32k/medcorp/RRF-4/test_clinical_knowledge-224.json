    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about the internet usage of people over 65 years old. Document [2] states that only 55.7% of the elderly people were using the Internet in 2014. Document [6] shows that 75% of ages 65-69 and 55% of over 80's access the internet. Document [13] states that older people have a greater amount of trust in a person with whom they are able to actively discuss their health as opposed to a nonliving source, which they have to access or manipulate, such as the Internet. Document [22] shows that older adults' online health information seeking behavior is not adequately investigated. Document [26] states that older adults do not use ICT to a great extent to access information in their everyday lives, with many expressing no interest in learning how to do so. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that while a significant number of older adults do use the internet, there are also many who do not, or who prefer other sources of information. Therefore, providing information solely through the internet could exclude a significant portion of this population.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
