    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence, while a deletion is the removal of one or more nucleotides from a DNA sequence. So, I need to find an option that has one nucleotide changed and one nucleotide missing compared to the original sequence. Option A has one nucleotide changed (G to C) but no nucleotide is missing. Option B has one nucleotide changed (G to T) and one nucleotide missing (T). Option C has one nucleotide changed (A to C) but no nucleotide is missing. Option D has no nucleotide changed but one nucleotide is missing (T). Therefore, the correct answer is option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
