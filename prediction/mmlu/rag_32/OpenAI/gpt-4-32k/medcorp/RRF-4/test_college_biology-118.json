    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question refers to an experiment where mouse cell-surface proteins and human cell-surface proteins were observed to integrate along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. This suggests that the two types of cells were combined in some way. Looking at the options, producing a heterokaryon and producing a hybrid cell both involve combining cells. However, a heterokaryon is a cell that contains two or more nuclei in a common cytoplasm, which is produced by the fusion of cells, while a hybrid cell is produced by the fusion of the nuclei. The experiment described in the question involves the fusion of cells, not nuclei, so producing a heterokaryon is the most likely technique used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
