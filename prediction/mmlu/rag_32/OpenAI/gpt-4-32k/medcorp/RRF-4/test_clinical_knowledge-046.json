    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The structure of DNA is such that a purine always pairs with a pyrimidine. Adenine (a purine) pairs with Thymine (a pyrimidine) and Guanine (a purine) pairs with Cytosine (a pyrimidine). This is known as complementary base pairing. Therefore, in a double-stranded DNA molecule, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is always 1:1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. always 1:1.\"}"
