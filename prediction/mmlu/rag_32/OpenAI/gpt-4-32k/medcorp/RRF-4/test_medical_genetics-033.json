    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a cross between two true breeding lines, one with dark blue flowers and one with bright white flowers, which produces F1 offspring that are light blue. This suggests that neither the dark blue nor the white trait is completely dominant over the other, as the resulting offspring is a blend of the two parent traits. When the F1 progeny are selfed, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. This ratio is typical of a monohybrid cross, where the two alleles of a single gene segregate independently. The fact that the F1 generation shows a blend of the two parental traits, and the F2 generation shows a 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio, suggests that the trait for flower color in this case follows the pattern of incomplete dominance. In incomplete dominance, the phenotype of the heterozygote is intermediate between the phenotypes of the homozygote parents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. incomplete dominance\"}"
