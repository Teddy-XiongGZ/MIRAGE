    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute low back pain, which is a common condition often triggered by physical exertion, such as yard work. The absence of red flag symptoms such as changes in bowel or bladder function, history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, or neurologic deficits suggests a benign, self-limited condition.
