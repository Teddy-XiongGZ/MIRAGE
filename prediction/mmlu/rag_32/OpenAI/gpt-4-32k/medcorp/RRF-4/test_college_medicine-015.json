    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The absolute threshold for hearing is the minimum level of sound that an organism can detect. In this case, the absolute threshold would be the lowest power level at which the mice were able to hear the bell and press the lever. According to the information given, at 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever, indicating that they were able to hear the bell. Therefore, 60% power is the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell in this experiment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 60%\"}"
