    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The alpha-helix is a common secondary structure in proteins. According to Document [28], the alpha-helix is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between atoms of the peptide backbone. This is also supported by Document [17], which states that forming a hydrogen bond on folding contributes to protein stability. Document [11] also mentions that the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds provides another important contribution to protein stability. Therefore, the stabilization of the unique coiled structure of an alpha helix in a protein is primarily attributed to hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
