    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the structure that closes and seals off the lower airway during swallowing. From the documents, it is clear that the epiglottis and the larynx play crucial roles in this process. The epiglottis slopes backward, thereby sealing off the larynx, and the larynx moves up and forward, facilitating the movement of food and fluid over and around the closed larynx and into the esophagus. However, the question specifically asks about the 'sealing' of the lower airway, which is more directly associated with the action of the epiglottis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Epiglottis\"}"
