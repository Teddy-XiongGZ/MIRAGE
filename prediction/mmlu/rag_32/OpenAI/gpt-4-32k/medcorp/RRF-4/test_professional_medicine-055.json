    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The physician's behavior is concerning and could potentially put patients at risk. It is not appropriate to simply ask the physician if he is sober and take his word for it (Choice A), as he may not be in a position to accurately assess his own sobriety. Asking him to submit to a blood sample (Choice B) could be seen as invasive and confrontational, and may not be the best first step. Allowing him to sleep in his office (Choice D) does not address the potential problem of substance abuse. The most appropriate next step would be to relieve the physician of duty and alert the hospital's patient safety officer (Choice C). This ensures patient safety and allows for a thorough investigation into the physician's behavior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
