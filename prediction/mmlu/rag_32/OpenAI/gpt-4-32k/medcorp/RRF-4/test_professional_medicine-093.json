    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a persistent nonproductive cough and is taking enalapril for hypertension. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors are known to cause cough as a side effect. This is due to the accumulation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator peptide, in the respiratory tract. Normally, ACE breaks down bradykinin, but when ACE is inhibited, bradykinin accumulates and can cause cough.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\"}"
