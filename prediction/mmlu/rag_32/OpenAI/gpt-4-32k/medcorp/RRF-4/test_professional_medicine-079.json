    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's behavior of berating the nurses and other staff, and expressing disgust towards one of his children, suggests a psychological defense mechanism. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable feelings or thoughts to others. Projective identification is a form of projection where an individual induces feelings or impulses which are conceived as dangerous in another person. Reaction formation involves behaving in a way that is exactly opposite of one's true feelings. Splitting, however, is a defense mechanism where a person cannot integrate the good and bad aspects of self or others, and instead divides people into 'all good' or 'all bad'. In this case, the patient is polite to the physician (seeing them as 'all good') but berates the nurses and other staff (seeing them as 'all bad'). He also splits his children into 'good' and 'worthless'. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior is splitting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
