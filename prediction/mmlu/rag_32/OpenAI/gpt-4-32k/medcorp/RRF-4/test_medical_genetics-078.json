    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The initial transcript in eukaryotes undergoes several modifications before it is ready for translation. These modifications include the addition of a 5' cap and a 3' poly A tail, and the removal of introns. The ribosome binding site is not a component of the transcribed RNA, but rather a site on the mRNA where the ribosome binds during translation. Therefore, the component that is present in the initial transcript but is removed before translation is the intron.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
