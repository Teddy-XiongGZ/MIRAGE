    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate a Staphylococcus aureus infection, which is a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections. The mecA gene detected in the organism indicates methicillin resistance, meaning the bacteria are resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and ciprofloxacin. Rifampin is typically used in combination with other antibiotics to treat staphylococcal infections and is not usually used alone due to the rapid development of resistance. Therefore, vancomycin, which is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
