    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Looking at the documents, it is clear that water is commonly used for oral hygiene practices such as rinsing the mouth and cleaning oral hygiene tools like toothbrushes and tongue scrapers (Documents 0, 5, 15, 16). Hydrogen peroxide is mentioned in Document 16, but it is recommended for wound healing, not specifically for cleaning the mouth. Lemon and glycerine swabs are not mentioned in any of the documents.
