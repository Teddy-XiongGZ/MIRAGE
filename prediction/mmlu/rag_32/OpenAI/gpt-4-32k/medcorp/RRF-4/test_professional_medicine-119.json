The patient's symptoms of 'drop attacks' characterized by episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes, along with incontinence during one of these episodes, suggest a neurological issue. Given her history of rheumatoid arthritis, atlanto-axial instability is a possible cause. Atlanto-axial instability is a condition in which there is excessive movement at the junction between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2) vertebrae in the neck. This can occur as a result of rheumatoid arthritis and can lead to compression of the spinal cord, causing symptoms such as weakness, numbness, and loss of bladder control.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
