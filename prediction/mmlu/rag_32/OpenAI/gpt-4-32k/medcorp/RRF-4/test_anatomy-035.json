    "Step 1: The auditory tube, also known as the Eustachian tube, is mentioned in several documents. I need to find information that matches the answer choices. Step 2: Document [5] states that the auditory tube links the nasopharynx to the middle ear, not the inner ear. So, option A is incorrect. Step 3: Document [26] mentions that the Eustachian tube is derived from the first pharyngeal pouch and second endodermal pouch, not the second pharyngeal pouch. So, option B is incorrect. Step 4: Document [25] states that the only active muscle that opens the Eustachian tube is the tensor veli palatini, not the levator veli palatini. So, option C is incorrect. Step 5: There is no information in the documents suggesting that the tensor veli palatini closes the Eustachian tube. So, option D is also incorrect. However, since we need to choose an answer, and the tensor veli palatini is indeed involved in the functioning of the Eustachian tube (as per Document [25]), option D seems to be the least incorrect. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The auditory tube links the nasopharynx to the middle ear, not the inner ear, so option A is incorrect.
