    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the target of digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers by DNase. DNase is an enzyme that cuts DNA. Nucleosomes are the basic unit of DNA packaging and are composed of a segment of DNA wound around eight histone protein cores. This structure is known as the nucleosome core. The DNA that links these cores is known as linker DNA. From the documents, it is clear that DNase targets the linker DNA between nucleosomes, not the nucleosome core or the histones. Therefore, the answer is D. Linker DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
