    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The right atrioventricular valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. It is not a semilunar valve, so option A is incorrect. The valve is indeed prevented from everting by the papillary muscles, which makes option B correct. The right atrioventricular valve is closed during systole to prevent backflow of blood into the right atrium, so option C is incorrect. Lastly, the right atrioventricular valve does not prevent blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes, this is the function of the pulmonary valve, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
