    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the reason for the negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water. This is related to the density of solid water (ice) compared to liquid water. Document [0] states that the unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water. Document [4] also confirms that ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water. This is due to the extensive network of hydrogen bonding which requires a greater separation of water molecules. Therefore, the answer should be the one that states that solid water has a lower density than liquid water and this is due to the hydrogen bonds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
