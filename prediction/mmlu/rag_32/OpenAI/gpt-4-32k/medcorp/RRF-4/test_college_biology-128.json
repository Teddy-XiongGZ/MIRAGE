    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Root pressure is a phenomenon in plant physiology that causes water to move from the soil into plant roots. This process is driven by the difference in water potential between the soil and the root cells. When the water potential of the root cells is more negative than that of the soil, usually due to high concentrations of solute, water can move by osmosis into the root from the soil. Therefore, the process by which water enters the roots due to root pressure is osmosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. osmosis\"}"
