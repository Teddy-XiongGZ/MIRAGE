    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peripheral neuropathy is a condition that affects the peripheral nerves, which are responsible for transmitting signals from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. According to Document [1], damage to these nerves can impair sensation, movement, gland, or organ function depending on which nerves are affected. This means that sensory loss, which is one of the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, would likely follow the distribution of the affected nerves. In many cases, this follows a 'stocking' or 'glove and stocking' distribution, which means that the areas most distal (farthest from the center of the body) are affected first and most severely. This is supported by Document [4] which mentions the distribution of weakness as a key question in diagnosing peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, option A seems to be the most accurate. Options B, C, and D describe symptoms more commonly associated with central nervous system disorders, such as increased tone and brisk reflexes, or a pattern of weakness that is more marked proximally than distally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
