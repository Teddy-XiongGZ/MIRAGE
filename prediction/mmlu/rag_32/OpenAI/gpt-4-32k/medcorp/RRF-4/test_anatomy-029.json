    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The atrioventricular bundle, also known as the bundle of His, is part of the electrical conduction system of the heart. It is not formed of autonomic nerve processes, but rather specialized cardiac muscle fibers, known as Purkinje fibers, as mentioned in Document [21]. This rules out options A and C. The atrioventricular bundle is indeed an important electrical connection between the atria and ventricles, but it is not the only one. Document [22] mentions that there are at least four locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium, including Bachmann's bundle, the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus. This means that the atrioventricular bundle forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles, which leads us to option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
