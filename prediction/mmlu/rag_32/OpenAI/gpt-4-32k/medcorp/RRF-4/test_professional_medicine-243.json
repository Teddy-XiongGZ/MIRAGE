    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is on multiple medications for the same. He has just undergone a knee replacement surgery. The question is asking for the best prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in this patient. Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices (Choice A) can be used as a mechanical method to prevent DVT, but it might not be sufficient for this patient given his cardiac history and recent surgery. Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin (Choice B) could be an option, but it requires close monitoring and might increase the risk of bleeding. Oral warfarin (Choice C) is also an anticoagulant that could prevent DVT, but it takes several days to reach a therapeutic level and might interact with the patient's other medications. Subcutaneous enoxaparin (Choice D) is a low molecular weight heparin that is often used for DVT prophylaxis after surgery. It has a predictable anticoagulant response and does not require close monitoring like intravenous heparin. Therefore, it seems to be the most beneficial choice for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
