    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a 2-year history of progressive memory loss, repetition, and forgetfulness. Her Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30, which indicates cognitive impairment. Her laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12, thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits, which rules out vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid disease as causes of her symptoms. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss, which is consistent with atrophy seen in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a cholinesterase inhibitor, which is used to treat symptoms of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
