    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds. From Document [0], it is mentioned that the phosphocreatine (PCr) store decreased exponentially during contraction and was practically depleted at 50 s. This suggests that phosphocreatine is used as an energy source during muscle contraction. Also, glycolysis began within 5 s after initiation of contraction, which means it is not the initial source of energy. ATP and creatine phosphorylation are also sources of energy, but the question is asking for the initial source, which according to the document is phosphocreatine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. phosphocreatine stores.\"}"
