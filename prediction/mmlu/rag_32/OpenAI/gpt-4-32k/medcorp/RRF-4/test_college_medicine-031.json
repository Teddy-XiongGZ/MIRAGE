    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The second scientist's argument is based on the idea that advantageous traits randomly occur and when they prove beneficial, they lead to rapid population growth in a short evolutionary time. This is essentially a description of punctuated equilibrium, where long periods of little evolutionary change are interrupted by brief periods of rapid change. Therefore, any evidence that supports this pattern of evolution would strengthen the second scientist's argument. Looking at the options, option B describes a pattern of long periods of stagnant growth followed by short bursts of massive evolution, which aligns with the second scientist's argument.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
