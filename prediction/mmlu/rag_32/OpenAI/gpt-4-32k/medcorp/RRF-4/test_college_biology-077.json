    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thigmotropism is a directional growth movement which occurs as a mechanosensory response to a touch stimulus. This is seen in climbing plants such as vines that grow around a surface, such as a trellis. Phototropism is the growth of organisms in response to a light stimulus. Gravitropism (or geotropism) is a turning or growth movement by a plant or fungus in response to gravity. Negative gravitropism is the growth of plant parts against the force of gravity. In this case, the question is about a plant growing along a trellis, which is a response to touch, not light or gravity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
