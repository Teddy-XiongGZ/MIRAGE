    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has systemic sclerosis, which is known to cause lung involvement. The most common lung manifestations of systemic sclerosis are interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient's symptoms of progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough, along with the physical examination finding of crackles in both lower lung fields, are suggestive of interstitial lung disease. This is further supported by the pulmonary function test results, which show a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, a common finding in interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is characterized histologically by diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Therefore, this is the most likely finding on lung biopsy in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
