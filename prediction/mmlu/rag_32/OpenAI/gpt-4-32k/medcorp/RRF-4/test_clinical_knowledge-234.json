    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sensory assessment of the arm. Let's go through the options one by one. Option A suggests using a venepuncture needle to test pain. This is not typically done in a clinical setting due to the invasive nature of the procedure and potential for harm. Option B suggests that proprioception and light touch are appreciated via the same tracts. This is incorrect as proprioception is mediated by the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, while light touch is mediated by both the dorsal columns and the spinothalamic tract. Option C suggests using a 256 Hz tuning fork to test vibration sense. This is correct as a 256 Hz tuning fork is commonly used in clinical settings to assess vibration sense. Option D suggests that impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns. This is incorrect as pain and temperature sensations are carried by the spinothalamic tract, not the dorsal columns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
