    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process in which a rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte causes the release of proteolytic enzymes to prevent polyspermy. From the documents, it is clear that this process is referred to as the cortical reaction. The cortical reaction is a process initiated during fertilization upon the activation of a sea urchin egg, leading to changes in the egg's cortical region to prevent further sperm from entering the egg. The zona reaction is not applicable here as it is a term used in mammalian fertilization. The acrosomal reaction refers to the reaction that occurs in the sperm, not the egg. The fertilization reaction is a broader term that encompasses all the reactions that occur during fertilization, not specifically the one described in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. cortical reaction\"}"
