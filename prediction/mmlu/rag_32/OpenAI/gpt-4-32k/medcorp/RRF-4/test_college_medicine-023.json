    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osmosis is the process where water molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration across a semi-permeable membrane. Passive transport is the movement of substances across the membrane without the expenditure of cellular energy. Active transport is the movement of ions or molecules across a cell membrane into a region of higher concentration, assisted by enzymes and requiring energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport in which a cell transports molecules into the cell by engulfing them in an energy-using process. The question asks for a process that uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane, which is the definition of passive transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
