    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phosphocreatine is a molecule that serves as a rapidly mobilizable reserve of high-energy phosphates in skeletal muscle, myocardium and the brain to recycle adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of the cell. According to Document [0], phosphocreatine is produced in the mitochondria and then diffuses to myofibrils. Document [3] also mentions that phosphocreatine serves as an energy reservoir for the rapid buffering and regeneration of ATP in various tissues and cells, including skeletal muscle. However, it does not specify that phosphocreatine is exclusively located in the mitochondria. Therefore, it can be inferred that phosphocreatine is not confined to a single subcellular compartment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. all subcellular compartments.\"}"
