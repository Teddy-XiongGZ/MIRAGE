    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A type I error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis, meaning we get a false positive. The probability of making a type I error is denoted by alpha. In this case, the alpha value is set at 0.05, which means there is a 5% chance of making a type I error. This value is set by the researchers and is not affected by the sample size. A type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis, meaning we get a false negative. The probability of making a type II error is denoted by beta. In this case, the beta value is set at 0.20, which means there is a 20% chance of making a type II error. The power of a study is the probability that it will correctly reject a false null hypothesis, or 1 - beta. The power of the study is directly related to the sample size: the larger the sample size, the greater the power of the study. Therefore, if the sample size decreases, the power of the study will also decrease, and the chance of making a type II error (beta) will increase. Sensitivity is a measure of how well a test correctly identifies true positives. It is not directly related to the sample size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
