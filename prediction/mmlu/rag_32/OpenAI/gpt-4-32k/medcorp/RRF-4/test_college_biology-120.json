    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the term that describes a subunit of DNA and protein consisting of 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA surrounding a protein octomer. Document [15] describes that nucleosomes are macromolecular complexes of DNA and histones, and that two loops of DNA (approximately 146 nucleotide pairs) are wrapped around the core octomer. This description closely matches the question, so the answer is likely 'nucleosome'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
