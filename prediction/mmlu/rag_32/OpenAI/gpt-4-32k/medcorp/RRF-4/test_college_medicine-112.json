    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. However, in the human circulatory system, the heart supplies the needed energy gradients for blood flow, and gravity does not hinder uphill flow nor does it cause downhill flow, because gravity acts equally on the ascending and descending limbs of the circuit. This is because the circulatory system is a closed system, as stated in Document [6]. Therefore, the pressure in a capillary in the neck should be the same as the pressure in a capillary in the knee, assuming they have equal cross-sectional areas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
