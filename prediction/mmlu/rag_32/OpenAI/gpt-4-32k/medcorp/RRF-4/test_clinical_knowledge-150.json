    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Early Warning Score (EWS) is a tool used to quickly determine the degree of illness of a patient based on vital signs. It is not limited to a specific age group, as indicated in option A. It is also not limited to patients admitted to the Emergency Department (option B) or those who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit (option C). According to Document [3], it is used to identify in-hospital deterioration and cardiac arrest, which can occur in any patient, not just those in the emergency department or ICU. Document [27] also mentions that EWS is used in patients with acute pancreatitis, which can occur post-operatively. Therefore, option D seems to be the most accurate as it includes any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
