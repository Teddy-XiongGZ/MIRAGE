    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Marine birds drink seawater, which is hyperosmotic, meaning it has a higher concentration of salts than their body fluids. To maintain their internal osmolarity, they need to get rid of the excess salts while conserving water. Document [15] explains that oceanic birds have salt glands that help excrete excess salt from the body through the nasal openings. This mechanism allows them to maintain their internal osmolarity despite drinking seawater. The document does not mention the production of large volumes of urine, which would lead to water loss, nor the absorption of salts, which would increase their internal osmolarity. Therefore, the best answer is that marine birds excrete salts through specialized salt-exchange glands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
