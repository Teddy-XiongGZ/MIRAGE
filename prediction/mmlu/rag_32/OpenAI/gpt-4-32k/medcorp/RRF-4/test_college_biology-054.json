    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking which factor does not promote linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium refers to the non-random association of alleles at different loci in a given population. Step 2: Review the documents. Document [3] mentions that linkage disequilibrium is influenced by many factors, including selection, the rate of genetic recombination, mutation rate, genetic drift, the system of mating, population structure, and genetic linkage. Step 3: Analyze the choices. A. Asexual reproduction: Document [2] mentions that linkage disequilibrium in asexual populations can be defined in a similar way in terms of population allele frequencies. This implies that asexual reproduction can promote linkage disequilibrium. B. Coadapted gene complexes: Document [30] mentions that linkage disequilibrium can help understand the joint evolution of linked sets of genes, which could include coadapted gene complexes. This implies that coadapted gene complexes can promote linkage disequilibrium. C. Epistasis: Document [24] mentions that stable or quasistable linkage disequilibrium can be maintained even with free recombination, provided that there is a strong enough epistatic interaction. This implies that epistasis can promote linkage disequilibrium. D. Random mating: Document [7] mentions that in the absence of evolutionary forces other than random mating, Mendelian segregation, random chromosomal assortment, and chromosomal crossover, the linkage disequilibrium measure converges to zero along the time axis at a rate depending on the magnitude of the recombination rate between the two loci. This implies that random mating does not promote linkage disequilibrium, but rather, it reduces it. Step 4: Choose the correct answer. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Random mating.
