    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transmembrane proteins span the entirety of the cell membrane and are usually highly hydrophobic. This is because the interior of the lipid bilayer is hydrophobic. Therefore, the amino acids in the transmembrane domains are often hydrophobic. Among the given amino acids, glycine, tyrosine, arginine, and isoleucine, isoleucine is a hydrophobic amino acid. Therefore, it is most likely to be inside the transmembrane domain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Isoleucine\"}"
