    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rational choice theory is based on the idea that individuals make decisions based on their own benefit, taking into account the costs and benefits of each option. This theory assumes that individuals have complete information, that their preferences are transitive (if they prefer A over B and B over C, they will prefer A over C), and that their choices are independent of irrelevant alternatives. None of the options provided (Hierarchical, Patriarchal, Matriarchal, Oligarchic) directly relate to these principles. However, if we consider the structure of decision-making in rational choice theory, it could be seen as a form of hierarchy, where options are ranked based on their perceived benefit to the individual.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
