    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the requirement of two different signal peptides for protein targeting. From the documents, it is clear that proteins are targeted to different locations within the cell using signal peptides. However, the requirement of two different signal peptides is not common. Document [5] mentions that the mitochondrial targeting signal, also known as presequence, can contain additional signals that subsequently target the protein to different regions of the mitochondria. This suggests that mitochondria might require two different signal peptides, but mitochondria is not an option in the question. Document [30] mentions a '2A-Like' signal sequence that functions both as a signal sequence and as a translational recoding element, resulting in two forms of nascent polypeptide being synthesized and targeted to different locations. However, this doesn't seem to be specific to any of the options provided in the question. The only document that mentions chloroplasts in the context of signal peptides is Document [10], which states that an N-terminal signal targets to the plastid in a similar manner as the mitochondrial targeting signal. However, it doesn't mention the requirement of two different signal peptides. Therefore, none of the documents provide clear evidence that two different signal peptides are required for targeting to the plasma membrane, lysosome, cytosol, or chloroplast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
