    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Codeine is a prodrug that requires conversion to morphine by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 to produce an analgesic effect. Some individuals are poor metabolizers of codeine due to genetic polymorphisms resulting in decreased CYP2D6 activity. These patients experience inadequate pain control because they cannot convert codeine to its active metabolite, morphine. The fact that other family members also have poor pain control with codeine suggests a genetic cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\"}"
