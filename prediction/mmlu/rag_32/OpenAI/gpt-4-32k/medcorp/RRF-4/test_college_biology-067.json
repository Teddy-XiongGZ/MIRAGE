    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental process in the life cycle of a plant. It is involved in the development, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis of the plant. According to Document [8], one of the two long-distance transport systems in vascular plants, xylem, consists of several cell types 'the differentiation of which involves deposition of elaborate cell-wall thickenings and programmed cell death.' This suggests that xylem vessel members undergo PCD to become functional.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Xylem vessel member\"}"
