    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about Moshe Szyf's work. Document [16] provides a brief overview of Szyf's work, stating that he has studied the epigenetic effects of stressors ranging from early life experience to obesity. However, it does not provide a specific label for his work. Document [5] also discusses Szyf's work, focusing on his research on the relationship between maternal care and stress response in rat pups. Again, no specific label is given for his work. Finally, Document [25] mentions Szyf's work in the context of a study on the relationship between prenatal exposure to maternal mood and genetic expression, which results in increased reactivity to stress in offspring. This suggests that his work could be described as 'social epigenetics', as it involves the study of how social and environmental factors can influence genetic expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
