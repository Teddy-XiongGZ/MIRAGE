This is not a counterculture, as that term refers to a group that actively opposes the dominant culture. It's also not a culture lag, which refers to the delay in cultural adjustments to changing social conditions. A microculture refers to the smallest units of culture, such as individuals or small groups, which doesn't quite fit the scenario described.
