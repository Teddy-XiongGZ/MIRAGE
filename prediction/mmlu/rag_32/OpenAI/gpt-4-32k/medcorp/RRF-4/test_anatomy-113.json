    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gas exchange in the lungs occurs primarily in the alveoli, as stated in Document [0]. The alveoli are the primary site of gas exchange where diffusion of gases into the arterioles occurs. The bronchi and bronchioles are part of the airway system that delivers air to the alveoli, but they do not directly participate in gas exchange. Capillaries are involved in the process as they carry the blood to and from the alveoli, but the actual exchange of gases occurs in the alveoli.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
