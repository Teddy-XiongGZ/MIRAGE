    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles of the heart. This defect allows blood to flow from the left ventricle (which pumps oxygenated blood to the body) to the right ventricle (which pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs). Therefore, the right ventricle would have a higher percentage of oxygenated blood than normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
