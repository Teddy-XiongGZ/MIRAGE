    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gastrulation is a stage in embryonic development where the embryo is reorganized into a multilayered structure known as the gastrula. This process generates the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm as stated in Document [2]. Neurulation is a process that follows gastrulation and involves the formation of the neural tube from the ectoderm layer. Therefore, gastrulation involves the formation of the mesoderm and occurs before neurulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
