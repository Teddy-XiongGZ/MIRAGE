    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sensitivity is a measure of how well a test correctly identifies a condition. In this case, it's how well the blood test identifies prostate cancer. To calculate sensitivity, we need to know the number of true positive results (men who have prostate cancer and the test correctly identifies them as such) and the number of false negatives (men who have prostate cancer but the test incorrectly identifies them as not having it). The question tells us that 90 men were correctly identified as having prostate cancer (true positives), but we don't know how many men had prostate cancer but were not correctly identified by the test (false negatives). This information would be obtained from prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
