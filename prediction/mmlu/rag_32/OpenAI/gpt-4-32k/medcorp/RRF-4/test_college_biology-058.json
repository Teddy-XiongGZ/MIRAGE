    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first group of animals that developed lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs. From the documents, it is clear that the evolution of lungs occurred in stages, with different groups of animals developing different types of lungs.
