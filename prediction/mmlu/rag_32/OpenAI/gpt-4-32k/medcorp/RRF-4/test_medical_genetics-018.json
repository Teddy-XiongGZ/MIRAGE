    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"HLA haplotypes are inherited from parents, so an individual would share a haplotype with both their mother and father. However, the question asks for the relative with whom an individual is most likely to share a common HLA haplotype. According to Document [0], siblings have a 25% chance of having received the same haplotypes from both parents, a 50% chance of sharing just one haplotype, and a 25% chance of sharing neither. This suggests that siblings have a higher likelihood of sharing a common HLA haplotype compared to an individual's offspring (son), who would only inherit half of the individual's HLA haplotypes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Sister\"}"
