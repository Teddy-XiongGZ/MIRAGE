Therefore, the head of the sixth rib would articulate with the body of the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6) and the body of the fifth thoracic vertebra (T5). The superior facet of the head of the rib articulates with the inferior costal facet on the body of the vertebra above, and the inferior facet of the head of the rib articulates with the superior costal facet of its own vertebra. This is stated in Document [1]. Therefore, the head of the sixth rib would articulate with the inferior costal facet of T5 and the superior costal facet of T6.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
