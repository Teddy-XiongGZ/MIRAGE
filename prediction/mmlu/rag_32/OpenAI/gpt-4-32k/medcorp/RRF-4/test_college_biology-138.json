    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, as described in the documents, involves several key elements. These include the overproduction of offspring (Document 1), competition for limited resources (Document 22), and differential survival and reproductive success (Document 3). These elements lead to the survival and reproduction of the fittest individuals, or those best adapted to their environment. However, Darwin's theory does not specifically mention the inheritance of both 'fit' and 'unfit' genes. While it is true that all genes, including those that may be considered 'unfit', can be passed on to the next generation, this is not a specific condition of natural selection as proposed by Darwin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
