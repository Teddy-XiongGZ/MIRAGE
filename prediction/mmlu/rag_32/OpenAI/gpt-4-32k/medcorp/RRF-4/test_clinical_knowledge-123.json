    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it's asking. The question is asking about the characteristics of the creatine kinase reaction. Step 2: Review the documents and find relevant information. Document [10] states that \"creatine kinase catalyzes the reversible reaction of creatine and ATP forming phosphocreatine and ADP.\" This indicates that the reaction is not irreversible, which eliminates option A. Step 3: Continue reviewing the documents for more information. Document [27] mentions that \"the creatine kinase reaction was not the rate-limiting step\" and \"the creatine kinase reaction was continuously in the state of quasi-equilibrium.\" This suggests that the reaction is not slow compared to glycolysis, which eliminates option B. Step 4: Keep reviewing the documents. Document [16] states that \"CK uses creatine to \"buffer\" the ATP/ADP ratio.\" This suggests that the reaction does not wait until all the ATP has been used up, which eliminates option C. Step 5: By process of elimination, the answer must be option D. However, to confirm, review the documents for any information about the reaction being inhibited by low pH in the muscle. Document [10] mentions that \"Depending on the pH, the enzyme operates by a random or an ordered bimolecular mechanism, with the equilibrium lying towards phosphocreatine production.\" This suggests that the reaction can indeed be affected by pH levels. Based on this step-by-step thinking, the answer is D. The creatine kinase reaction is inhibited by low pH in the muscle.
