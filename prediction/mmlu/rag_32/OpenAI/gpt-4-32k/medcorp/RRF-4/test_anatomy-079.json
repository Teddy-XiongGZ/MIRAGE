    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noradrenaline, also known as norepinephrine, is a neurotransmitter that is released by neurons in the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as heart rate and blood pressure. In the sympathetic nervous system, the pre-ganglionic neurons release acetylcholine, which then binds to receptors on the post-ganglionic neurons. These post-ganglionic neurons then release noradrenaline, which binds to receptors on the target organs. Therefore, noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter between sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
