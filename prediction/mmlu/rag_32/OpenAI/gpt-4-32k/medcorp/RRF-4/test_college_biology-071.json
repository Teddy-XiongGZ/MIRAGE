    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the movement of a fluorescent molecule of 1,000 daltons from one cell to another. From Document [0], we learn that molecules up to 874 dalton can pass from cell to cell, suggesting that a molecule of 1,000 daltons might also be able to do so. Document [17] further supports this by stating that molecules with a molecular weight of less than about 1,000 daltons can pass into another cell through gap junctions. Therefore, the answer is likely to be a gap junction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
