    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. ADP, or adenosine diphosphate, is a molecule involved in energy transfer in cells. When it is broken down, it can produce various products. Looking at the documents, Document 26 discusses the degradation of adenine nucleotides during intense exercise, mentioning that hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid increase in the blood. Document 5 also mentions that ADP degradation leads to an increase in plasma ammonia. Therefore, the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports are ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
