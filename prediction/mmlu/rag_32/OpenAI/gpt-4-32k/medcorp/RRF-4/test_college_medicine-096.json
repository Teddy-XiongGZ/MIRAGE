    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noncompetitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme, regardless of whether the substrate is present or not. This means that increasing the substrate concentration will not affect the impact of a noncompetitive inhibitor, as it does not compete with the substrate for the active site. On the other hand, uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex, meaning they only bind once the substrate is already attached to the enzyme. Therefore, increasing the substrate concentration would increase the number of enzyme-substrate complexes, providing more opportunities for the uncompetitive inhibitor to bind and exert its effect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increasing impact of uncompetitive inhibitor\"}"
