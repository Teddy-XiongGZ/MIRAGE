    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactate is produced in the muscles during exercise and then enters the circulation. According to Document [0], skeletal muscle plays an important role in lactate clearance and lactate oxidation. Document [1] also mentions that the two primary fates of lactate in skeletal muscle are oxidation and glycogen synthesis. Document [2] further supports this by stating that lactate released from working muscle is the primary fuel source for the heart. Document [8] also mentions that most of the lactate formed during sustained, steady-rate exercise is removed by oxidation. Therefore, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is not conversion to urea in the liver (option A), conversion to glucose in the heart (option B), or excretion via the kidneys (option C), but uptake and oxidation by other tissues (option D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
