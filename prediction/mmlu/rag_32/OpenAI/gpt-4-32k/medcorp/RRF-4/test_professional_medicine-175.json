    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of postprandial right upper quadrant and epigastric pain radiating to the right scapula are classic for biliary colic, a symptom of gallstones. Biliary colic occurs when a gallstone temporarily obstructs the cystic duct, leading to increased pressure in the gallbladder and subsequent pain. The pain is often severe and steady, and it peaks over 20 to 60 minutes. It then either resolves or plateaus for 1 to several hours. The pain can also radiate to the right scapula or back. Risk factors for gallstones include the four F's: Fat, Female, Fertile, and Forty. This patient has three of these risk factors (obesity, female sex, and age over 40). The most appropriate next step in management is to perform an abdominal ultrasonography, which is the best initial test for suspected gallstones due to its high sensitivity and specificity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
