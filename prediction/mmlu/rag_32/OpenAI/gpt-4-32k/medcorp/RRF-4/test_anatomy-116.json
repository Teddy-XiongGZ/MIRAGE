    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ectoderm is one of the three primary germ layers formed in early embryonic development. According to Document [0], the ectoderm differentiates to form the neural tube, neural crest cells and the epidermis. The neural tube cells give rise to the central nervous system. Document [11] states that tooth enamel is formed from the surface ectoderm. Therefore, the ectoderm gives rise to both the neural tube and dental enamel. However, there is no mention in the documents about the ectoderm giving rise to ectomesenchymal cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. all three structures.\"}"
