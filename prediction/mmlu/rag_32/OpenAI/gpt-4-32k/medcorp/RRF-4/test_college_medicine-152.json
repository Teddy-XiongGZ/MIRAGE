    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) is the primary source of energy for muscle contraction. It is mentioned in multiple documents such as Document [2], Document [3], Document [4], Document [5], Document [6], Document [7], Document [17], Document [19], Document [22], Document [23], Document [26], Document [28], Document [30]. Although ADP, phosphocreatine, and oxidative phosphorylation are involved in the energy supply process, they are part of the ATP regeneration process or energy storage, not the direct energy source for muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
