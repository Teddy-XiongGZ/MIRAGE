    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype by altering the sequence of DNA, which in turn can change the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide. This can lead to the production of a different protein, which can result in a new phenotype. This process does not involve a change in the polarity of tRNA or the direction in which the gene is read. While methylation of nucleic acids can affect gene expression, it is not a direct result of mutations in DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
