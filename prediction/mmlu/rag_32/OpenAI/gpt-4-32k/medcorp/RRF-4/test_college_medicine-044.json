    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The DNA polymerase creates a new DNA strand by adding complimentary nucleotides to the template strand. In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) and vice versa. Therefore, if the template strand has a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases, the newly synthesized complimentary strand of DNA will have a ratio of 2:3 of A:T bases because the adenine in the template strand will pair with thymine in the new strand and the thymine in the template strand will pair with adenine in the new strand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 2:03\"}"
