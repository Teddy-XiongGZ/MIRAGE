    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the acceptable range of variation between three readings when recording peak flow results. None of the documents provided seem to directly address this specific question. However, Document [23] mentions a mean difference of 21 L/min between unobserved and encouraged PEF readings, and Document [21] mentions a mean difference of 15 L/min between two different peak flow meters. These values suggest that a variation of 20-30 L/min might be expected in normal use. However, without a direct statement in the documents, it's hard to definitively choose an answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unable to determine from the provided documents.\"}"
