    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what cytochalasin B does to the growth cone of a neuron. According to Document [2], cytochalasin B causes rounding up of growth cones, retraction of microspikes, and cessation of axon elongation. This effect correlates with an ultrastructural alteration in the filamentous network of growth cones and microspikes. No other organelle appears to be affected by the drug. Removal of cytochalasin allows reinitiation of growth cone-microspike activity, and elongation begins anew. This suggests that the effect of cytochalasin B is reversible. Now, I need to determine whether it affects microtubules or microfilaments. According to Document [13], cytochalasin B causes retraction of microspikes, rounding-up of growth cones, and cessation of axon elongation. These experiments indicate that both structural integrity of the axon and continuing function of its motile tip are essential elements in axonal elongation. This suggests that cytochalasin B affects the microfilaments in the microspike, not the microtubules in the axon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
