    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endurance training is associated with aerobic exercise, which primarily uses oxygen to generate energy. This type of training leads to adaptations in the muscle that enhance its ability to utilize fat and carbohydrates as fuel sources. This is achieved through an increase in oxidative enzymes and mitochondrial content in the muscle fibers, as mentioned in Document [0], Document [2], and Document [21]. On the other hand, endurance training does not primarily focus on increasing the speed of muscle contractions, which is more associated with strength or power training. The breakdown of phosphocreatine is more related to anaerobic energy production, which is not the primary focus of endurance training. Lastly, endurance training is not primarily focused on generating energy anaerobically, but rather it enhances the muscle's capacity to generate energy aerobically.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
