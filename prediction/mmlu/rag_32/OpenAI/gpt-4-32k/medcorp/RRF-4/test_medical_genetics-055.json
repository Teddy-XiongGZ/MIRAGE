    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lac operon in E. coli is responsible for the metabolism of lactose. It is regulated by a repressor protein that binds to the operator region of the operon, preventing transcription of the genes when lactose is not present. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator, thus allowing transcription of the genes. If a mutation prevents the repressor from binding to lactose, the repressor will remain bound to the operator, preventing transcription of the genes regardless of the presence of lactose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
