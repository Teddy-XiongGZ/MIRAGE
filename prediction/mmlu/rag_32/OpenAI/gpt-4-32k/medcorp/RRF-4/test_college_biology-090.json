    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that hybrids between some related species of plants are sterile due to the parent plants having different chromosome numbers. However, when the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously, it can regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes can pair normally. This is because the doubled chromosome number allows for orderly meiosis, leading to viable seed production. Therefore, the descendants of these plants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
