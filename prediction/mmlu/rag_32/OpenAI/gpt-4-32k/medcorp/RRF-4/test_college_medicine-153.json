    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking how a single gene can produce multiple proteins. The process of transcription is not selective, it transcribes the entire gene, so option A is incorrect. Doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule does not necessarily lead to different proteins, so option B is incorrect. The process of alternative RNA splicing involves the removal of introns and rejoining of exons in different combinations, which can lead to different proteins being produced from the same gene, so option C seems correct. Splicing of the mRNA molecule after it has been formed from the primary transcript is essentially describing the process of alternative RNA splicing, so option D is also correct. However, option C is more specific and directly answers the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
