    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for a true statement about Paget's Disease. Step 2: Review the answer choices. The choices are about the symptoms and complications of Paget's Disease. Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [4] mentions that Paget's disease is characterized by an abnormal increase of osteoclast and, hence, osteoblast activity, which results in the formation of unhealthy and fragile bone. This could potentially lead to fractures, which contradicts choice D. Step 4: Document [20] mentions that the affected bones in Paget's disease show signs of dysregulated bone remodeling at the microscopic level, specifically excessive bone breakdown and subsequent disorganized new bone formation. These structural changes cause the bone to weaken, which may result in deformity, pain, fracture or arthritis of associated joints. This could potentially lead to bowing of a long bone, which supports choice A. Step 5: Document [25] mentions that the most common reason for patients' pain is osteoarthritis, either directly or indirectly induced by Paget's disease. This does not mention spinal cord compression or heart failure, which neither supports nor contradicts choices B and C. Based on the information from the documents, the most supported choice is A.
