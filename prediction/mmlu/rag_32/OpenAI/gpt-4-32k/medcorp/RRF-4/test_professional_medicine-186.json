    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of leg swelling and weight gain, along with physical findings of periorbital edema, bulging flanks, shifting dullness to percussion, and pitting edema in the lower extremities, suggest fluid retention and possible kidney dysfunction. The patient's history of taking ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is notable because NSAIDs can cause nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder that leads to the excretion of excessive amounts of protein in the urine. Nephrotic syndrome can cause edema and weight gain due to fluid retention. Therefore, a test that measures urine protein concentration would likely show abnormal results in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Urine protein concentration\"}"
