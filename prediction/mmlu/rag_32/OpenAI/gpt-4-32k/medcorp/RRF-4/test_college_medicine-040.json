    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The teacher's reward system involves two types of reinforcement schedules. The first one, where she gives a sticker to each student who showed up on time, is a continuous reinforcement schedule because the reward follows every instance of the behavior. The second one, where she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row, is a fixed-ratio schedule because the reward follows a set number of instances of the behavior. The question asks why the students' behavior change was stronger in response to the quizzes (fixed-ratio schedule) than to showing up on time (continuous reinforcement schedule). This suggests that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
