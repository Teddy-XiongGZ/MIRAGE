    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 75-year-old female who presents with fatigue and has a leukocyte count of 25.0 x 103/mcL, which is above the reference range of 4.5-11.0 x 103/mcL. The peripheral blood smear shows 97% mature-appearing lymphocytes, which are of B-cell origin. This suggests a lymphocytic leukemia, which narrows down the options to either acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, ALL typically presents with immature lymphocytes, or 'blasts', rather than mature-appearing lymphocytes. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is a type of leukemia that typically presents in older adults and is characterized by a high number of mature-appearing lymphocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
