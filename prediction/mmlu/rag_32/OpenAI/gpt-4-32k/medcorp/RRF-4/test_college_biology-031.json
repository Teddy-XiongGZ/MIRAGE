    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Somatic cells are any cells in the body other than sperm and egg cells. They contain the entire genetic information of the organism, which is derived from the original zygote, so option A is incorrect. Somatic cells in humans have a diploid nucleus, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. This includes 44 autosomes, so option C and D are incorrect. However, in males, there is typically one X and one Y chromosome. The inactivated X chromosome, also known as a Barr body, is typically found in female somatic cells, not male. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
