    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a painless swelling in the left testicle that has varied in size over the past several months. The lesion transilluminates well, which suggests that the swelling is likely due to a fluid-filled structure such as a hydrocele or cyst. The absence of trauma and normal testicular scan further support this.

Injection with a sclerosing agent, needle aspiration, and needle biopsy are typically not first-line treatments for this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. surgical repair\"}"
