    "First, I will consider each of the answer choices in relation to the information given in the question. A. Moderate sexual size dimorphism - This refers to a difference in size between males and females of the same species. The question does not provide any information about the size of the males and females in the rodent species. B. High parental investment - This refers to the amount of time and energy parents invest in raising their offspring. The question mentions that the rodents have small litter sizes, which could suggest a higher level of parental investment per offspring. C. Precocial young - This refers to offspring that are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching. The question does not provide any information about the maturity or mobility of the rodent offspring at birth. D. Frequent extrapair matings - This refers to a mating system in which a member of a pair mates with an individual other than their partner. The question does not provide any information about the mating system of the rodent species. Based on the information given in the question, the most likely characteristic for the rodent species to exhibit is high parental investment. The small litter size could suggest that the parents are able to devote more time and resources to each offspring, which is a characteristic of high parental investment. So, the answer is B. High parental investment. Now, I will generate the output in json format. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I considered each of the answer choices in relation to the information given in the question.
