    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the daily dose in grams of Cotrimoxazole, which is prescribed as 960 mg every 12 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the drug is taken twice daily. Therefore, the total daily dose in milligrams is 960 mg * 2 = 1920 mg. To convert milligrams to grams, we divide by 1000 (since there are 1000 milligrams in a gram), so 1920 mg = 1.92 g.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
