    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why the genes that allow host birds to be tricked into raising cuckoo fledglings remain in the gene pool. This means we need to find a reason that this behavior would be beneficial or at least not detrimental to the host birds. Looking at the options, option A suggests that the host birds' response allows them to efficiently rear their own young by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry. This could be a plausible explanation, as it suggests that the behavior is beneficial in terms of energy efficiency. Option B suggests that the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species. This seems unlikely, as raising another species' offspring would likely take resources away from raising their own offspring. Option C suggests that little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own. This also seems unlikely, as raising offspring is generally a costly endeavor in terms of energy. Finally, option D suggests that the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced. This doesn't make sense as the question is about the host bird, not the cuckoo. Therefore, the most plausible answer seems to be option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
