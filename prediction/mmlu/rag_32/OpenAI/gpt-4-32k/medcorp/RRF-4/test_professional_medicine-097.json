    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, malaise, and vulvar pain, along with the physical findings of a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions, and palpable nodes in the inguinal and femoral areas, suggest a sexually transmitted infection. The description of the lesion starting as a pustule that ulcerates and forms satellite lesions is characteristic of chancroid, which is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Chlamydia trachomatis typically causes cervicitis or urethritis, not ulcerative lesions. Neisseria gonorrhoeae can cause disseminated gonococcal infection, which can include skin lesions, but these are typically pustular and not ulcerative. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) can cause various skin and soft tissue infections, but it is not typically sexually transmitted.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Haemophilus ducreyi\"}"
