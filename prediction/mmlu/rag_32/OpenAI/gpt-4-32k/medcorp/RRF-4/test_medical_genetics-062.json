    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker is calculated by multiplying the frequency of each allele. In this case, the frequency of each allele is 0.2. Therefore, the likelihood of an individual carrying both alleles is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
