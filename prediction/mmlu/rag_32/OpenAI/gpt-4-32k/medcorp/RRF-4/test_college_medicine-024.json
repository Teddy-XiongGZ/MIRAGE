    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inner membrane of the mitochondrion is where the electron transport chain takes place. This is mentioned in Document [2], which states that the inner mitochondrial membrane contains proteins that perform the electron transport chain redox reactions. The tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) enzymes are located in the matrix of the mitochondrion, not the inner membrane. Glycogen and triacylglycerol molecules are not mentioned in the context of the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
