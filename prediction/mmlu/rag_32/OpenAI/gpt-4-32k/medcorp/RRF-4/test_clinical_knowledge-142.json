    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The contractile process in skeletal muscles is initiated by an increase in intracellular calcium. This calcium binds to a protein called troponin, which is part of the thin filament in muscle fibers. When calcium binds to troponin, it causes a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin molecules, allowing myosin to bind to actin and initiate muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. calcium binding to troponin.\"}"
