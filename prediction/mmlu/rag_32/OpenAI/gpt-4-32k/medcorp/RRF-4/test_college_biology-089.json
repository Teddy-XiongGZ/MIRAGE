    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The theory suggests that pollen grains, when exposed to water, undergo osmotic shock which leads to the release of starch granules. Osmotic shock occurs when there is a sudden change in the solute concentration around a cell, causing a rapid change in the movement of water across its cell membrane. In this case, if the pollen grains are rupturing and releasing their contents, it means that water is entering the pollen grains. This would happen if the interior of the pollen grains had a higher solute concentration, or was hypertonic, compared to the surrounding environment. This would cause water to move into the pollen grains to try to equalize the concentration, leading to them swelling and eventually rupturing. Therefore, the interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
