    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding, which is defined as any change in the regularity, frequency, heaviness, or duration of menstruation. Given her age and the irregularity of her bleeding, the most likely cause is anovulation, which can be due to perimenopause.
