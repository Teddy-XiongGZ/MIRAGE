    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cuff on a tracheostomy tube is mentioned in several documents. Document [1] states that one of the applications of a cuffed tracheostomy tube is for fixation, positive pressure ventilation, and aspiration prevention. Document [3] also mentions that tracheostomy tubes can be cuffed or uncuffed. Document [14] explains that cuffed tracheostomy tubes have inflatable balloons at the end of the tube to secure them in place. Document [20] mentions that cuffed tracheostomy tubes are used for patients on long-term mechanical ventilation and those at risk for aspiration. Document [30] also mentions that the presence of a cuff and its inflation significantly increases airway pressure. From these documents, it is clear that the purpose of the cuff on a tracheostomy tube is to create an air seal within the trachea and reduce the risk of aspirating saliva or gastric contents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
