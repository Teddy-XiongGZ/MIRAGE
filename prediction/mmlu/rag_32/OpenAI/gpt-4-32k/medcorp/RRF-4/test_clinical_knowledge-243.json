    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the assessment of power in the arms, which is a medical concept related to the strength and function of the muscles in the arms. This is not a statistical concept, so documents discussing statistical power are not relevant. The question is also not asking about legal or political power, so documents discussing those topics are not relevant. The question is asking about specific aspects of muscle function and anatomy, so I need to find a document that discusses these topics. None of the provided documents contain information relevant to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unable to answer based on provided documents\"}"
