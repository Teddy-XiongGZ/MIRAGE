    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, clitoral enlargement, and increased serum testosterone concentration suggests a condition of hyperandrogenism. The normal levels of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids, along with the presence of an ovarian mass, suggest that the source of excess androgens is likely ovarian in origin. Among the given options, a Sertoli-Leydig tumor, a type of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor, is known to produce androgens and can cause virilization, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. Granulosa tumors typically produce estrogens, not androgens. Ovarian carcinoids are rare and typically associated with carcinoid syndrome, not described in this case. Teratomas are germ cell tumors that can contain various types of tissue, but they are not typically associated with hormone production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
