    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate of blood lactate accumulation is influenced by both the production and removal of lactate. Document [0] explains that when exercising at or below the lactate threshold, any lactate produced by the muscles is removed by the body without it building up. However, with an exercise intensity higher than the threshold, the lactate production exceeds the rate at which it can be broken down, leading to an increase in blood lactate concentration. Document [1] also mentions that at rest or low levels of exercise, the rate of lactate production in muscle cells and consumption in muscle or blood cells allows lactate to remain in the body at a certain steady state concentration. If a higher level of exercise is sustained, blood lactose levels will increase before becoming constant, indicating that a new steady state of elevated concentration has been reached. Therefore, the rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by the difference between the rate of lactate appearance and the rate of lactate clearance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
