    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Early-successional plant communities are typically characterized by rapid growth and colonization, often in disturbed or new environments. This is usually achieved by species that are r-selected, meaning they prioritize rapid reproduction and dispersal over competitive ability or longevity. This is opposite to K-selected species, which are typically found in later stages of succession and prioritize competitive ability and longevity over rapid reproduction. Therefore, we can rule out option C. Option A, high niche divergence, is also more characteristic of later stages of succession, when competition for resources drives species to occupy different niches. Therefore, we can rule out option A. Option D, high detrital biomass, is also more characteristic of later stages of succession, when there has been more time for organic matter to accumulate. Therefore, we can rule out option D. This leaves us with option B, high ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass, which is characteristic of early-successional communities. These communities are often dominated by fast-growing, r-selected species that prioritize rapid growth and reproduction, leading to high rates of primary production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
