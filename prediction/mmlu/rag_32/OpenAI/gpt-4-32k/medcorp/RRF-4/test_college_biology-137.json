    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several active pools of carbon, including the atmosphere, terrestrial vegetation, and the oceans. However, Document [0] states that the ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth. Document [15] and Document [23] also confirm that about 95% of the total active pool of carbon at the Earth's surface is stored in the ocean. Therefore, the oceans are the largest active pool of carbon on Earth and contribute the most to carbon cycling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. The oceans\"}"
