    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, which means there is a risk of Rh incompatibility. If fetal Rh-positive blood cells cross into the maternal circulation, the mother's immune system may recognize these cells as foreign and produce antibodies against the RhD antigen, a process known as Rh sensitization. This is not a problem in a first pregnancy, but in subsequent pregnancies, these antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy the baby's red blood cells, leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn. Rho(D) immune globulin is given to Rh-negative mothers to prevent this sensitization by binding to any Rh-positive cells in the maternal circulation before the mother's immune system can produce antibodies against them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
