    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the correct statement about haemorrhoids among the given options. Step 2: Review each option in the context of the provided documents. Option A: Document [13] states that internal haemorrhoids often result in painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating. This suggests that bleeding from haemorrhoids does not lead to melaena (dark, tarry stools due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding), which contradicts option A. Option B: Document [5] and Document [2] mention that haemorrhoids are common in pregnancy. This supports option B. Option C: Document [13] again mentions that internal haemorrhoids often result in painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating. This contradicts option C, which suggests that bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is associated with pain. Option D: Document [15] mentions that internal haemorrhoids can be treated either conservatively or surgically, depending upon their severity. This suggests that second degree haemorrhoids can be returned to the anal canal, which contradicts option D. Step 3: Based on the review of the documents, the correct answer is option B. The final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each option in the context of the provided documents.
