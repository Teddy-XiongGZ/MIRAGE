    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms described in the question, such as fever, chills, tachypnea, sore throat, swollen glands, and severe malaise, are common in many respiratory infections. However, the key information here is the isolation of a gram-positive rod from the respiratory tracts of the patients. This suggests a bacterial infection. Looking at the options, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Haemophilus influenzae are bacteria, while Epstein-Barr virus is a virus. Since a gram-positive rod was isolated, we can rule out Haemophilus influenzae, which is a gram-negative rod. Between Bordetella pertussis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the latter is known to cause respiratory complications and myocardial involvement, which matches the symptoms described in the question. Therefore, Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the most likely cause of the outbreak.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
