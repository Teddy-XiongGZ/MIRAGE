    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatigue in high intensity exercise is related to the energy supply and demand in the body. ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the main source of energy for cells. When the body is engaged in high intensity exercise, the demand for ATP increases. If the supply of ATP cannot keep up with the demand, fatigue occurs. This is supported by Document [0] which states that 'With intense activity, ATP production rates are unable to match ATP utilization rates, and reductions in ATP occur accompanied by accumulation of a range of metabolic by-products such as hydrogen ions, inorganic phosphate, AMP, ADP and IMP. Selective by-products are believed to disturb Na+/K+ balance, Ca2+ cycling and actomyosin interaction, resulting in fatigue.' Therefore, the answer is not a fall in the cell concentration of ADP or inhibition of ATP production. Lack of skill is not a physiological cause of fatigue. Hence, the answer is failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
