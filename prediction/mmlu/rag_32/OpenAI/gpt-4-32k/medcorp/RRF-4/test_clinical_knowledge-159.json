Document [3] suggests that lack of information can contribute to ineffective pain management. Document [5] shows that patients expect more pain than they experience from receiving an epidural block. Document [8] suggests that providing information to patients can enhance their expectations of pain. Document [9] suggests that patients can forecast their postoperative disability and pain. Document [16] suggests that communication between the healthcare provider and the person experiencing pain is a common challenge in pain management. Document [17] suggests that managing the patient's expectations is crucial in the treatment plan.
