    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is unable to eat 6 days after surgery, which means she needs nutritional support. Central hyperalimentation, also known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), provides all the nutrients the body needs and is given through a catheter placed in a large vein. However, TPN is usually reserved for patients who cannot or should not get their nutrition through eating. Feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube could be an option, but it might not be tolerated well by the patient due to her nausea and vomiting. An oral fat-free modular diet might not be suitable because the patient is unable to eat. Peripheral hyperalimentation, also known as peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN), is less concentrated than TPN and is given through a small vein usually located in the arm. PPN is used for patients who have a functioning GI tract but cannot take in enough nutrients by eating or drinking. Given the patient's condition, central hyperalimentation seems to be the most appropriate form of nutritional support.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
