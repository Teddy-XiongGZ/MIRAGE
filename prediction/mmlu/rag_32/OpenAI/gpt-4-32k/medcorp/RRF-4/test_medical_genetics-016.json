    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals. This is a classic Mendelian genetics problem. Each parent can pass on either the dominant or recessive allele for each gene to their offspring. The probability of passing on the dominant allele for each gene (A, B, C) is 1/2. Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities together. So, the probability of an offspring receiving all dominant alleles (AABBCC) from both parents is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
