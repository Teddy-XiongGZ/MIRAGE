    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Barr body is an inactive X chromosome found in female mammalian cells. According to Document [19], the Barr body is formed through processes such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, which help inactivate gene expression on the inactive X-chromosome and bring about its compaction. This compaction of the DNA prevents the expression of most genes, which is a characteristic of heterochromatin. Therefore, the Barr body is an example of heterochromatin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
