    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of a tender, fluctuant mass in the labia suggest a Bartholin duct cyst or abscess. Bartholin glands are located bilaterally at the posterior introitus and drain through ducts that empty into the vestibule at approximately the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions. These glands secrete mucus to provide vulvovaginal moisture and lubrication. Obstruction of the duct can lead to cyst formation. If the fluid within the cyst becomes infected, an abscess can form. Bartholin duct cysts are often asymptomatic, whereas abscesses cause pain that can be severe. On examination, a nontender or tender mass may be palpated in the labia majora. The treatment of a Bartholin abscess is incision and drainage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
