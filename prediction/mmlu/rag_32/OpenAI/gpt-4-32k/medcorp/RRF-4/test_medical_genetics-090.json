    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autozygosity mapping is a method used to identify recessively inherited disease genes. This is often used in small inbred families where there is a higher chance of homozygosity due to the parents sharing a common ancestor. The documents mention that autozygosity mapping has been invaluable for determining the genetic basis of lethal autosomal recessive disorders. Therefore, the pattern of inheritance that autozygosity mapping is used to map is autosomal recessive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Autosomal recessive\"}"
