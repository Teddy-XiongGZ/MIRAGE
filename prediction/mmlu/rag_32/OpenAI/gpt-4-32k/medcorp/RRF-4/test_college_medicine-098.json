    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are involved in the stabilization of microtubules, which are a component of the cytoskeleton and play a central role in cell structure, division, and intracellular transport. In nerve cells, MAPs like MAP2 and tau are particularly important for maintaining the structure and function of neurons. If a mutation leads to reduced function of MAPs, this would likely disrupt the stability of microtubules, affecting the structure and function of neurons. This would not directly affect cardiac muscle contraction, transcription of mRNA from DNA, or the Krebs cycle, as these processes do not rely on the stability of microtubules in nerve cells. However, meiosis, a type of cell division, could be affected as it relies on the proper function of the microtubule network for the separation of chromosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Meiosis\"}"
