    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are known to facilitate chemical reactions, but they do not do this by raising the temperature of the reaction mixture, so option A is incorrect. They also do not alter the equilibrium constant of a reaction, so option B is incorrect. While enzymes can increase the rate of a chemical reaction, they do not directly increase the maximal rate of the reaction (V_max), so option C is incorrect. According to the documents, enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction, which speeds up the conversion of reactants to products. This makes option D the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
