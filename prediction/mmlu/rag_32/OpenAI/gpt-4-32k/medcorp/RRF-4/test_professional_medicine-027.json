    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that her mother is likely a carrier of the disease, as indicated by her elevated creatine kinase levels. However, the patient's creatine kinase levels are normal. While elevated creatine kinase levels can indicate carrier status, normal levels do not necessarily rule it out, as seen in Document 30. Therefore, the patient's carrier status cannot be definitively determined based on her creatine kinase levels alone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation\"}"
