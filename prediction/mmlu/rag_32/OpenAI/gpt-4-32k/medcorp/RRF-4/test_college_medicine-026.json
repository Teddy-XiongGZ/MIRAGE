    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect formula for sound. The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. The formula is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v + vs), where f' is the observed frequency, f is the source frequency, v is the speed of sound (343 m/s), vo is the speed of the observer (camera), and vs is the speed of the source (car). We need to convert the speeds from km/h to m/s: 108 km/h = 30 m/s and 72 km/h = 20 m/s. Substituting these values into the formula, we get f' = 800 * (343 + 20) / (343 + 30).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 924 Hz\"}"
