    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scientist first stimulates the neurons and observes a sharp rise in membrane potential, which is the depolarization phase of an action potential. After this first stimulation, when she tries another stimulation immediately, there is no response. This is because the neurons are in the absolute refractory period, a time during which the neurons cannot generate another action potential regardless of the strength of a second stimulus. However, when she increases the voltage of the second shock, she observes a similar response to the first. This suggests that the neurons have entered the relative refractory period, a time during which a stronger-than-usual stimulus can generate another action potential.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hyperpolarization\"}"
