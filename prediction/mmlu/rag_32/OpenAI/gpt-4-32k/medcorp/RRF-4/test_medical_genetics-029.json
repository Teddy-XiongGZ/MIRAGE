    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autosomal recessive disorders occur when an individual inherits two copies of a mutated gene, one from each parent. If both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder, it means they both have two copies of the mutated gene. Therefore, they can only pass on the mutated gene to their offspring. As a result, each of their children will inherit two copies of the mutated gene and will be affected by the disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
