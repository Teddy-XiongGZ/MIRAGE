    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of cystic fibrosis is a key clue in this case. Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects multiple organ systems, including the lungs and the pancreas. Pancreatic insufficiency can lead to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, which include vitamins A, D, E, and K. Vitamin K is necessary for the synthesis of several clotting factors. Deficiency can lead to bleeding and bruising, as seen in this patient. The knee swelling could be due to a hemarthrosis, or bleeding into the joint space, which can occur with trauma but also spontaneously in severe vitamin K deficiency. None of the documents provided information about cystic fibrosis or vitamin K deficiency leading to bleeding disorders, but based on my medical knowledge, this is the most likely explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
