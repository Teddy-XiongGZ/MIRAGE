    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Western blot hybridization is used to detect specific proteins in a sample, not protein-DNA interactions. Northern blot hybridization is used to study gene expression by detection of RNA (or isolated mRNA) in a sample. Southern blot hybridization is used for detection of a specific DNA sequence in DNA samples. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) is a common affinity electrophoresis technique used to study protein-DNA or protein-RNA interactions. This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA sequence. Therefore, the correct answer is EMSA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
