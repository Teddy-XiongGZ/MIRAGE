    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism that would further increase the patient's blood pressure. Blood pressure is determined by the cardiac output and the peripheral vascular resistance. Cardiac output is the product of heart rate (pulse) and stroke volume. Therefore, a decrease in cardiac output, pulse, or stroke volume would likely lead to a decrease, not an increase, in blood pressure. On the other hand, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance would lead to an increase in blood pressure because the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the constricted vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased peripheral vascular resistance\"}"
