    "The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) is a concept developed by Vygotsky that describes the difference between what a learner can do without help and what he or she can do with help. It is the gap between the \"actual developmental level\" that the child can reach alone, and the \"potential developmental level\" that the child can reach with guidance from a teacher or in collaboration with peers. Looking at the options: A. A baseball player hitting baseballs from a tee to build muscle memory is practicing a skill independently. This does not involve guidance or assistance from a more knowledgeable other, so it does not fit the concept of ZPD. B. A concert flute player falling short of finishing a piece that has a very complex ending without mistakes is struggling with a task, but there is no mention of guidance or assistance from a more knowledgeable other, so this does not fit the concept of ZPD. C. A high school English student submitting a paper for review by his professor is seeking feedback, but this is a one-way interaction and does not necessarily involve guidance or collaboration in the learning process. This does not fully fit the concept of ZPD. D. A high diver taking instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move involves guidance from a more knowledgeable other (the coach) to help the learner (the diver) achieve a higher level of performance. This fits the concept of ZPD. Therefore, the answer is D. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) is a concept developed by Vygotsky that describes the difference between what a learner can do without help and what he or she can do with help.
