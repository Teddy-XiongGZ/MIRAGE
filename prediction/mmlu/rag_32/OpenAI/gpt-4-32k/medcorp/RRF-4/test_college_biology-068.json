    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a characteristic that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms. From the documents, it is clear that both angiosperms and gymnosperms are seed-producing plants. However, a key difference between them is how their seeds are produced and stored. According to Document [1], gymnosperms produce cones and seeds that are not enclosed within an ovary but rather sit on the surface of the plant. In contrast, Document [7] states that angiosperms produce their seeds enclosed within a fruit, which is a characteristic feature of angiosperms. Therefore, the characteristic that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms is that angiosperms have their seeds enclosed in ovaries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
