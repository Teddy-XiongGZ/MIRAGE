    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that in Class 1 hypovolaemic shock, which involves a volume loss of up to 15% of total blood volume, the heart rate is minimally elevated or normal and there is typically no change in blood pressure. This suggests that changes in heart rate and blood pressure may not be noticeable until more than 15% of the total blood volume is lost. Document [6] also supports this, stating that a decrease in systolic pressure in some patients may not become apparent before they have lost up to 30% of their blood volume. Therefore, the answer is likely to be between 15% and 30%. Given the options, the closest is 20%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 20%\"}"
