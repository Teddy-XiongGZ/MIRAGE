    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant's recent history of enteritis and dehydration could have damaged the intestinal mucosa, leading to a transient lactase deficiency. Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. If lactase is deficient, lactose cannot be broken down and absorbed in the small intestine, leading to osmotic diarrhea. The other options are less likely: Fructose intolerance usually presents with symptoms earlier in infancy and is associated with a more severe clinical picture. Magnesium deficiency does not typically cause diarrhea. Regional enteritis, or Crohn's disease, is very rare in infants and would likely present with more systemic symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
