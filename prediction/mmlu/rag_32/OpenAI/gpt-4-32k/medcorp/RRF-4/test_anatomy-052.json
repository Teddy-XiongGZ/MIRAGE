    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The systemic circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system which carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The sequence starts from the left ventricle, then the blood is pumped into the aorta. From the aorta, the blood travels through the arteries and arterioles to reach the capillaries. After the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products in the capillaries, the blood, now deoxygenated, travels through venules into veins and finally returns to the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Left ventricle \u2192 aorta \u2192 arteries \u2192capillaries \u2192 veins\"}"
