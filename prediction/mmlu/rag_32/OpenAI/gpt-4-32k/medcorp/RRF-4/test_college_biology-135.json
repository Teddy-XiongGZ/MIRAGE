    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The quote suggests that when an ecosystem is disturbed by human activities, it tends to become simplified, meaning it loses its complexity and diversity. This simplification disrupts the stabilizing influences of density-dependent regulatory factors, which are natural mechanisms that help keep population levels of species in check. Therefore, in a disturbed ecosystem, we can expect to see larger populations of a smaller number of species, as the natural checks and balances that control population growth are disrupted. This aligns with option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
