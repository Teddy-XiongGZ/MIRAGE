    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cosmopolitan species is one that is found across all or most of the world in appropriate habitats. To achieve such a wide distribution, a species would need to be able to disperse over long distances, either through its own abilities or through other means such as wind or water currents, or human activity. Therefore, the capacity for long-distance dispersal would be a key attribute for a species to become cosmopolitan. In contrast, extreme habitat specialization, a K-selected reproductive rate (which typically involves producing fewer offspring but investing more in their survival), and limited dispersal abilities would all likely limit a species' distribution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
