    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The synthesis of an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template involves the creation of a complementary DNA strand using the RNA as a template. This process is known as reverse transcription and is carried out by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. A primer, which can be either DNA or RNA, is also required to initiate the synthesis of the new DNA strand. Therefore, both a primer and reverse transcriptase are necessary for this process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
