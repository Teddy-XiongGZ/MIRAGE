    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that is caused by a lack of expression of the UBE3A gene, which is located on chromosome 15. This gene is usually only expressed from the maternal chromosome. Therefore, a deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15 would not cause Angelman syndrome, as the gene is not usually expressed from this chromosome. Similarly, a mutation in the SNRPN promoter would not cause Angelman syndrome, as this is not the gene that is implicated in the disorder. Maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) 15 would not cause Angelman syndrome, as this would result in two copies of the maternal chromosome 15, and therefore two copies of the normally functioning UBE3A gene. However, paternal UPD 15 would result in two copies of the paternal chromosome 15, and therefore no expression of the UBE3A gene, which could cause Angelman syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Paternal UPD 15\"}"
