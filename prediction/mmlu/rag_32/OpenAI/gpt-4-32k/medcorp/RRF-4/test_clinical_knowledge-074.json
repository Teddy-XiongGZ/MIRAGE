    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactate is produced in the muscles during exercise, especially during intense exercise. This is a result of the process of glycolysis, where glucose is broken down to produce energy. When the demand for energy in the muscles outpaces the rate of oxygen supply, the body resorts to anaerobic metabolism, where glucose is broken down without the use of oxygen, leading to the production of lactate. Therefore, the activation of glycolysis at the onset of exercise would lead to an increase in muscle lactate production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
