    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the choice that is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive for this goose species. This means that cliff nesting should provide some sort of advantage or benefit to the geese. Choice A doesn't provide any advantage of cliff nesting. Choice C only describes a behavior, but doesn't explain why it might be beneficial. Choice D suggests that more chicks survive the fall than are killed, but it doesn't necessarily mean that cliff nesting is more beneficial than beach nesting. Choice B, however, suggests that cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than beach nesting. This implies that despite the risks, there are benefits to cliff nesting that make it a better choice for the geese, which is consistent with the idea that it's adaptive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
