    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of low back pain radiating down the leg, which started after lifting a heavy object, along with a positive straight-leg raise test and loss of ankle reflex, are indicative of sciatica. Sciatica is most commonly caused by a herniated disc, which occurs when the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc is displaced and impinges on the nerve root. Hypertrophy of the facet joints, osteophyte formation, and spondylolisthesis can also cause back pain, but they are less likely to cause the radicular symptoms seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
