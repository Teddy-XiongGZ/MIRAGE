    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proprioception refers to the body's ability to sense movement within joints and joint position. This ability enables us to know where our limbs are in space without having to look. It is important in all everyday movements but especially so in complicated movements where precise coordination is necessary. From the documents, it is clear that proprioceptive nerve endings are located in the synovial membrane, capsule, and ligaments of the joint. However, the articular cartilage has no nerve supply as stated in Document [0]. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one that includes synovial membrane, capsule, and ligaments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. capsule and ligaments.\"}"
