    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the reason why blood continues to flow through the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle. The contraction of the left ventricle is known as systole, and the relaxation is known as diastole. During systole, the left ventricle contracts and pumps blood into the aorta and other arteries. During diastole, the left ventricle relaxes and fills with blood again. The blood continues to flow through the vessels between contractions because the arteries have elastic recoil. This is mentioned in Document [7] which explains that the reversal of the ventricular-aortic pressure gradient in the presence of continuous flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta is the result of storage of potential energy in the stretched arterial walls. This stored potential energy causes blood flow from the left ventricle into the aorta to decelerate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
