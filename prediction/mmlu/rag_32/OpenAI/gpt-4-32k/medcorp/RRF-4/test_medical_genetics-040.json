    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not mention any specific genetic conditions related to severe anaemia at birth. However, Document [0] mentions that genetically determined abnormalities of haemoglobin are common in the tropics. Both Alpha-thalassaemia and Beta-thalassaemia are genetic disorders that affect the production of haemoglobin, potentially leading to anaemia. Sickle cell disease also affects the haemoglobin, but it is characterized by the production of abnormal sickle-shaped red blood cells, not necessarily severe anaemia at birth. Hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin is a condition where the body continues to produce the type of haemoglobin found in newborns, it does not directly cause severe anaemia at birth. Therefore, without specific information in the documents, both Alpha-thalassaemia and Beta-thalassaemia could be potential answers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
