    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of a persistent headache, photophobia, and neck stiffness with painful flexion are indicative of meningitis. The electric shock sensation when the neck is flexed forward is a positive Lhermitte's sign, which is often associated with disorders of the spinal cord, such as multiple sclerosis, but it can also be seen in other conditions like vitamin B12 deficiency, cervical spondylosis, and even meningitis.

Meningitis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate evaluation and treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Neck stiffness\"}"
