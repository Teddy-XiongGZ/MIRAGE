    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to find a document that provides a conversion factor or relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. Document [1] states that during aerobic activities, oxygen consumption provides an indirect estimate of energy expenditure. However, it does not provide a specific conversion factor. Document [14] provides a conversion factor for resting metabolic rate, but this may not apply to an active training session. Document [28] discusses the prediction of oxygen uptake and energy expenditure based on heart rate, but again, it does not provide a direct conversion factor. Therefore, we need to find a document that provides a direct conversion factor between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure during physical activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
