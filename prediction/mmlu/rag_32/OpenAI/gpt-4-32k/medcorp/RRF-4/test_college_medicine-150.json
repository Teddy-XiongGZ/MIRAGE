    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hypothalamus releases CRF in response to stress, which then triggers the release of ACTH from the pituitary gland. ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol into the bloodstream. Once the stressor is removed or the body has responded adequately to the stressor, cortisol levels in the blood decrease. This decrease in cortisol levels is sensed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which then reduce their release of CRF and ACTH, respectively. This is a classic example of a negative feedback loop, where the product of a process (in this case, cortisol) inhibits its own production by suppressing the activity of its producers (the hypothalamus and pituitary gland).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Negative feedback loop of cortisol.\"}"
