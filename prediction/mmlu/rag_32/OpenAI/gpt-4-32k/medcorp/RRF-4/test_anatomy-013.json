    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except for the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Therefore, if the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged, the cricothyroid muscle would still be functional, but the other muscles, including the interarytenoids, would be weak or paralyzed. This would result in the vocal fold on the injured side being tensed and in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
