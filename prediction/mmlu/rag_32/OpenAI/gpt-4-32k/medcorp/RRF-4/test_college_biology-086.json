    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The crouching behavior of very young birds in response to a predator's shape overhead is not a learned behavior because the birds are too young to have learned it. It is also not a conditioned response because it is not a behavior that has been reinforced or punished. It is not an imprinted behavior because imprinting refers to a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the consequences of behavior. Therefore, the crouching behavior is a fixed action pattern, which is an instinctive behavioral sequence that is indivisible and runs to completion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
