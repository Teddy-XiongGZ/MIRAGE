    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 1-year-old male who has burns on his hands and feet. The distribution of the burns is suspicious because it is in a 'stocking and glove' pattern, which is not typical for accidental burns. This pattern of burns is more consistent with an immersion injury, which is often seen in cases of child abuse. The story provided by the mother is also suspicious because it is unlikely that a 1-year-old child would be able to turn on the hot water in the bathtub. Therefore, it is important to consider the possibility of child abuse in this case. While medical treatment of the burns is important, it is also crucial to ensure the safety of the child. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to contact child protective services.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
