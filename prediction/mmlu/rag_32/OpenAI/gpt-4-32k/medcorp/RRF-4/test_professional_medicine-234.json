    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A killed vaccine is made from a virus or bacteria that has been killed or inactivated. This type of vaccine is unable to replicate and cause disease, which makes it safer for use in people with weakened immune systems or certain health conditions. On the other hand, a live vaccine contains a weakened form of the virus or bacteria that can still replicate, but is not strong enough to cause disease in healthy people. However, there is a risk that the weakened virus or bacteria in a live vaccine could mutate back to its disease-causing form, a process known as reversion to virulence. This is a major concern, especially for new viruses with unknown behavior. Therefore, the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for a newly identified severe respiratory illness would be to avoid the concern for reversion to virulence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
