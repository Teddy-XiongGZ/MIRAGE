    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DFP binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase, which is the same site where the substrate would normally bind. This suggests that DFP is a competitive inhibitor. However, the document also mentions that the binding of DFP to acetylcholinesterase is permanent, meaning that the enzyme cannot be reactivated. This characteristic is typical of irreversible inhibitors. Therefore, DFP is an irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
