    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems, and flowers. High temperature increases the rate of transpiration because it increases the vapor pressure deficit between the leaf and the atmosphere. Wind also increases the rate of transpiration by removing the boundary layer of humid air that surrounds the leaf, thereby increasing the vapor pressure deficit. Low relative humidity means the air is dry, and this also increases the vapor pressure deficit, leading to increased transpiration. However, high relative humidity means the air is already saturated with water vapor, reducing the vapor pressure deficit and thus decreasing the rate of transpiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
