    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Laryngeal oedema is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissues of the larynx. The question is asking why this accumulation is usually confined to the area above the vocal folds. Looking at the options, option B seems the most plausible. The mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues, which could prevent fluid from accumulating in this area. The other options do not seem to provide a logical explanation for why oedema would be confined to the area above the vocal folds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
