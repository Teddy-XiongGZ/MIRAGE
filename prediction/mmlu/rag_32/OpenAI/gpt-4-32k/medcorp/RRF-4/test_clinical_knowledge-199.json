    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fast-twitch fibers are known for their quick response and fatigue. This is due to their high ATPase activity, which allows for rapid ATP breakdown and thus quick energy supply. However, they have a relatively small number of mitochondria, which are the powerhouses of the cell and are responsible for sustained energy production. This is why these fibers fatigue quickly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
