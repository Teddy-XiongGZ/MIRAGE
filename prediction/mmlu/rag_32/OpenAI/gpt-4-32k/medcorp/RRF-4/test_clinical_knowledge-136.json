    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's go through the options one by one. Option A: The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6. This is confirmed by Document 26, which states that the biceps reflex is associated with the C5/C6 nerve roots. Option B: If no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon it is documented as absent. This is supported by Document 2, which explains that a score of 0 on the NINDS Muscle Stretch Reflex Scale indicates an absent reflex. Option C: The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa. This is incorrect according to Document 19, which states that the triceps tendon is struck just above the elbow, not in the antecubital fossa. Option D: Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion. This is not supported by any of the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
