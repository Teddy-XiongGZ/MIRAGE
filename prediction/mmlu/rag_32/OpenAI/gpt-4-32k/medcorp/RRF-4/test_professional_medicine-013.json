    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of pain at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity suggest a problem with a muscle that is involved in shoulder abduction. The supraspinatus muscle originates from the supraspinous fossa of the scapula and inserts into the greater tubercle of the humerus. It is one of the four muscles of the rotator cuff and its main function is to assist in abduction of the arm. The other options, anterior scalene, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis minor, are not primarily involved in shoulder abduction or do not have a direct attachment to the greater tubercle of the humerus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. supraspinatus\"}"
