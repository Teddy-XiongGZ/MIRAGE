    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Simple tandem repeat polymorphisms, also known as short tandem repeats (STRs) or microsatellites, are sequences of DNA that are repeated in a head-to-tail manner. They are highly variable in length among individuals, making them useful for identifying individuals or determining parentage. Document [0] mentions that these repeats are used for personal or parental identification, and their analysis is useful in forensics and DNA fingerprinting. Document [6] also mentions that tandem repeats can be very useful in determining parentage and are used for certain genealogical DNA tests. Therefore, these polymorphisms are most useful for solving criminal and paternity cases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
