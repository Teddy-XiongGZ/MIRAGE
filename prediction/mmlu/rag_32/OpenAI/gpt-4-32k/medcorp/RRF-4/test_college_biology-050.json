    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chemosynthetic bacteria are known for their ability to produce their own food without the need for light. This is because they derive energy from the oxidation of inorganic substances. This process is known as chemosynthesis, where they use energy stored in chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and oxygen to convert carbon dioxide to glucose. They do not need to transduce light energy into chemical energy because they do not rely on light for their energy source. Therefore, they do not oxidize organic compounds or reduce inorganic substances.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
