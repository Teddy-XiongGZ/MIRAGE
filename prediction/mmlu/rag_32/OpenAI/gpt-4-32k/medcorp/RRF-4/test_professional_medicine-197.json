    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are indicative of angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscles. This is usually due to the narrowing of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques. \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents, also known as beta blockers, are often used in the treatment of angina. They work by blocking the effects of the hormone epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. This causes the heart to beat more slowly and with less force, which reduces the workload on the heart and decreases the heart's demand for oxygen. Therefore, the mechanism by which beta blockers improve symptoms in this case is by decreasing myocardial contractility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
