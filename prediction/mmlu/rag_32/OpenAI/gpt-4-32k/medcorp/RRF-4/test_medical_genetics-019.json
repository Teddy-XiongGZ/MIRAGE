    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the gene that conveys susceptibility for polygenic Alzheimer's disease. Polygenic means that multiple genes contribute to the disease. Document [1] mentions that APOE is a major recognized genetic determinant of Alzheimer's disease. Document [3] also mentions that APOE has been established as a partially penetrant genetic risk factor for the more common late-onset form of the disease. Document [6] mentions APOE\u025b4 as a common risk factor associated with a moderate-to-high risk. Document [7] mentions that apolipoprotein E-4 is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Document [13] mentions APOE as the most common high genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Document [17] mentions APOE e4 as the only confirmed genetic risk factor. Document [19] mentions APOE e4 as a major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Document [24] mentions APOE e4 as the most robust risk gene for the development of this form of the disease. Document [27] mentions APOE e4 as the most important genetic factors associated with an increased risk of developing the disease in late onset FAD families. Document [28] mentions APOE e4 as a major contributor to Alzheimer's disease risk. Document [29] mentions APOE region accounts for much of the measurable genetic contribution to Alzheimer's disease. Document [30] mentions APOE as a weaker susceptibility factor. Therefore, the answer is APOE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
