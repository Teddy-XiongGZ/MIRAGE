    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I. The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functions, including behavior inhibitions, planning ahead, determining consequences of action, and differentiating between right and wrong (Document 4). Substance abuse can lead to changes in the prefrontal cortex, impairing inhibitory control and leading to a loss of impulse control (Document 0). Therefore, pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex are likely in this patient. II. Auditory hallucinations are not typically associated with substance abuse and diminished executive functioning. They are more commonly associated with disorders such as schizophrenia (Document 6). Therefore, increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations is not likely in this patient. III. Impulsivity, or reduced behavioral impulse control, is a common symptom of substance abuse (Document 0). Impaired inhibitory control resulting from drug-induced changes in the prefrontal cortex can lead to a loss of impulse control (Document 0). Therefore, reduced behavioral impulse control is likely in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. I and III only\"}"
