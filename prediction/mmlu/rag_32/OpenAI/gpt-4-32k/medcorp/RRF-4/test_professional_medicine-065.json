    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include sudden shortness of breath, cyanosis, loss of consciousness, and bleeding from multiple sites, which occurred during labor. These symptoms are consistent with amniotic fluid embolism, a rare but severe complication of pregnancy. This condition occurs when amniotic fluid, fetal cells, hair, or other debris enter the maternal circulation, causing cardiorespiratory collapse and coagulopathy. Intracerebral hemorrhage would likely present with neurological symptoms, which are not mentioned in the scenario. Myocardial infarction could cause loss of consciousness, but it would not explain the bleeding from multiple sites. Status asthmaticus would cause respiratory distress, but it would not cause the coagulopathy observed in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
