    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inner membrane of the mitochondrion is mentioned in several documents. Document [2] states that the inner mitochondrial membrane contains proteins with three types of functions: Those that perform the electron transport chain redox reactions, ATP synthase, which generates ATP in the matrix, and specific transport proteins that regulate metabolite passage into and out of the mitochondrial matrix. This indicates that the components of the electron transport chain are embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
