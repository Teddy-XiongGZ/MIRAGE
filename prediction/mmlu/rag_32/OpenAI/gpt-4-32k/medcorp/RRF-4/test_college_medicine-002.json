    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The gustatory system is responsible for the sense of taste, which is a chemically based sensory system as it detects chemical compounds in food and drink. The auditory system is responsible for the sense of hearing, which is not chemically based but rather based on the detection of sound waves. The olfactory system is responsible for the sense of smell, which is also a chemically based sensory system as it detects airborne chemical compounds. Therefore, both the gustatory and olfactory systems are chemically based sensory systems, while the auditory system is not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. I and III only\"}"
