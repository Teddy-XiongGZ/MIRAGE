    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Circulatory overload, also known as transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), is characterized by symptoms related to excess fluid in the circulatory system. According to Document [0], it is characterized by acute respiratory distress, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, acute pulmonary edema and/or evidence of positive fluid balance occurring within 6 hours after transfusion. Document [15] also mentions symptoms of TACO as shortness of breath (dyspnea), low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia), leg swelling (peripheral edema), high blood pressure (hypertension), and a high heart rate (tachycardia). Document [19] adds that patients may present with crackles when listening to the lungs, a murmur (S-3 murmur) when listening to the heart, leg swelling, and distended veins in the neck (jugular venous distension). Therefore, the signs and symptoms that match these descriptions are dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
