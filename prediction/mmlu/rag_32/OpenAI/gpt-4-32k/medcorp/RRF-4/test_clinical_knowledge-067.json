    "Step 1: Review the question and the potential choices. The question is asking for a true statement about headaches. Step 2: Review the relevant documents. - Document [1] mentions that headaches can serve as warning signals of more serious disorders, including those related to meningitis, but it does not state that neck stiffness with a headache is always due to meningitis. This makes choice A unlikely. - Document [4] and [5] suggest that severe headaches can be due to a range of causes, not all of which are life-threatening. This makes choice B unlikely. - Document [9] and [10] mention tension headaches as a common cause of headaches, which supports choice D. - None of the documents mention a strong association between temporal arteritis and rheumatoid arthritis, making choice C unlikely. Step 3: Choose the most likely answer based on the information in the documents. The most supported choice is D. The final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first reviewed the question and the potential choices. I then reviewed the relevant documents.
