    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been on glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months for sarcoidosis. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy is a well-known risk factor for avascular necrosis, particularly of the femoral head. This condition often presents with hip or groin pain that is exacerbated by weight-bearing or rotation of the hip. The other options are less likely: Herniated nucleus pulposus usually presents with radicular pain, not hip pain. Narrowing of the hip joint is typically seen in osteoarthritis, which is less likely in this young patient. Osteoporosis could be a side effect of long-term glucocorticoid use, but it would typically present with vertebral compression fractures causing back pain, not hip pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
