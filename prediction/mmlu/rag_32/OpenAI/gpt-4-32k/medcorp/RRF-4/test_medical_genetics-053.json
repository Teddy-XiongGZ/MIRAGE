    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Plasmid vectors are used for cloning and they grow within bacteria, which is mentioned in Document [2]. They can accommodate inserts of up to 15 kilobases as stated in Document [0] and Document [16], which means they cannot accommodate inserts of over 100 kilobases. The comparison between plasmid vectors and phage vectors is not mentioned in the documents, so we cannot determine if plasmid vectors can generally accommodate larger inserts than phage vectors. Lastly, the documents do not mention that plasmid vectors include centromeres to allow propagation in yeast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
