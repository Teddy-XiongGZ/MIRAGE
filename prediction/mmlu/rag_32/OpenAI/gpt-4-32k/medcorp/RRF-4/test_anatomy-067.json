    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The brainstem is responsible for basic vital functions and contains both white and gray matter. The white matter consists of fiber tracts passing down from the cerebral cortex, which are important for voluntary motor function, and up from peripheral nerves and the spinal cord, where somatosensory pathways travel. The motor pathway runs down through the basis, which is located at the most anterior part. All the somatosensory tracts run upward to the thalamus crossing the tegmentum in front of the cranial nerve nuclei. The question is asking about the location of decussation for certain pathways in the brain stem. Decussation refers to the crossing over of nerve tracts from one side of the body to the other. The medial lemniscus is a pathway in the brainstem that is responsible for carrying sensations of fine touch and proprioception to the thalamus. The pyramids are structures found on the ventral aspect of the medulla oblongata and contain the corticospinal tract, which is responsible for carrying motor signals from the brain to the body. Therefore, skilled motor movements decussate in the pyramids, not in the medial lemniscus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
