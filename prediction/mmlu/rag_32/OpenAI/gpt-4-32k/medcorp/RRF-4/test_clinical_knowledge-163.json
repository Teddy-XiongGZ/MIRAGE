    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations are indeed errors in DNA, but they are not always harmful. Some mutations can be neutral or even beneficial, as stated in Document [2]. Mutations do not only occur in the presence of carcinogens. They can occur due to a variety of factors, including errors during DNA replication or repair, as mentioned in Document [1] and Document [17]. While some mutations can increase tumor growth, this is not always the case. Therefore, the statement that mutations increase tumor growth is not universally true. Lastly, mutations do occur spontaneously at a low rate, as mentioned in Document [4] and Document [5]. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
