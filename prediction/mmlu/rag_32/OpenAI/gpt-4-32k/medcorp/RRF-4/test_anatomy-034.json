    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formation of the palate is a complex process that involves the fusion of several embryonic structures. According to Document [3], a cleft palate occurs due to a partial or total failure of fusion of the palatine prominences. Document [17] further explains that a primary cleft palate occurs due to a failure of fusion between the lateral palatine processes and the median palatine process. A secondary cleft palate results from a failure of the lateral palatine processes and the nasal septum to fuse. Therefore, the complete bilateral cleft palate is due to the failure of fusion of the palatine processes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
