    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. ADP, or adenosine diphosphate, is a molecule involved in energy transfer in cells. When it is broken down, it can produce various products. Document [26] mentions that 'Deficiency of myoadenylate deaminase, the muscle isoform of AMP deaminase encoded by the AMPD1 gene, is a common myopathic condition associated with alterations in skeletal muscle energy metabolism.' This suggests that AMP deaminase is involved in the breakdown of ADP. The same document also mentions that 'Maximal physical exercise in the group of trained subjects results not only in a lower post-exercise increase in the concentration of hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid but also in that of uridine.' This suggests that hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid are products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports. Document [1] also mentions that 'Maximal physical exertion is accompanied by increased degradation of purine nucleotides in muscles with the products of purine catabolism accumulating in the plasma.' This further supports the idea that hypoxanthine and uric acid are products of ADP degradation. Document [5] mentions that 'intravascular ADP significantly augments platelet activity during strenuous exercise and these prothrombotic responses are counteracted by concurrent release of soluble nucleotide-inactivating enzymes.' This suggests that ADP degradation products may also include enzymes that inactivate nucleotides. However, the document does not specify which enzymes these are. Based on this information, the answer is likely to be A. Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
