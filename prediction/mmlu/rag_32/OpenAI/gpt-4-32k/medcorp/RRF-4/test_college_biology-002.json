    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the fluid that encases the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates to prevent desiccation and injury. From the documents, it is clear that the amnion is the embryonic membrane that surrounds and protects the embryo, serving as a fluid-filled sac. The amnion aids in osmoregulation and serves as a reservoir. The chorion aids in gas exchange, the allantois collects liquid waste and handles gas exchange, and the yolk sac contains nutrients. Therefore, the amnion is the one that encases the embryo in a fluid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
