    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prosthetic groups, according to Document [0], are involved in the catalytic mechanism and required for activity in enzymes. They are tightly bound to proteins, as stated in Document [3]. They are not loosely bound to enzymes via hydrogen bonds, nor are they sites on the enzyme molecule that permit allosteric modification of enzyme activity. They are not required by all enzymes in the cell, but they are necessary for the activity of the enzymes they are part of.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
