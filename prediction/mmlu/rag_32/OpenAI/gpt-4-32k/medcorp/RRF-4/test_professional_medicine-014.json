    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was hit from behind below the right knee while playing football and now presents with foot drop on the right. This suggests an injury to the peroneal nerve, which is responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot. The peroneal nerve wraps around the fibular head, so a posteriorly deviated fibular head could potentially cause damage to the peroneal nerve and result in foot drop. The other options (anteriorly deviated distal femur, plantar flexed cuboid, and unilateral sacral shear) are not typically associated with foot drop.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. posteriorly deviated fibular head\"}"
