    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration are consistent with hypoglycemia, which is confirmed by a low serum glucose concentration. These symptoms improve with ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks, which contain sugar. The most common cause of hypoglycemia in adults is the use of drugs, such as insulin or sulfonylureas, in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, the patient does not have diabetes and is not taking any medications. Therefore, endogenous hyperinsulinism is a likely cause of her hypoglycemia. Endogenous hyperinsulinism can be due to an insulinoma, a rare tumor that secretes insulin. The diagnosis of an insulinoma is suggested by symptoms of hypoglycemia that are relieved by the ingestion of glucose and is confirmed by demonstrating inappropriately high serum concentrations of insulin and C-peptide during a spontaneous or induced episode of hypoglycemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations\"}"
