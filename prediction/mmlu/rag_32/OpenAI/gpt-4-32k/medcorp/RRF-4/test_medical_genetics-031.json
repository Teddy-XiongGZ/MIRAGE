    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that the frequency of heterozygotes in a population can be calculated using the formula 2pq, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. In this case, p is 0.6 and q is 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
