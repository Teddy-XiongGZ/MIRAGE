    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that ATP and phosphocreatine are the primary sources of energy for high-intensity, short-duration exercise. Document [1] states that the phosphocreatine system, which utilizes ATP and phosphocreatine, lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high-intensity work. Document [4] also mentions that ATP restoration lasts for approximately the first 30 seconds of exercise. Document [21] states that the phosphagen system, which uses ATP and phosphocreatine, can provide energy for exercises lasting up to ten seconds. Considering these pieces of information, the duration of maximal exertion exercise that can be sustained by the energy released from ATP and phosphocreatine breakdown is likely to be between 10 to 30 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 30-40 seconds.\"}"
