    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what an intracellular buffer is. From Document [22], I learned that intracellular buffers are substances that can accept or donate protons to maintain a stable intracellular pH. Next, I need to find out which of the given options can act as an intracellular buffer. From Document [17], I learned that carnosine is an anti-glycating agent that can act as a buffer to maintain intracellular pH. Therefore, carnosine is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
