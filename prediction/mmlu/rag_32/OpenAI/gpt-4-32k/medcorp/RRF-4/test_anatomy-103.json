    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endochondral ossification is the process of forming bone from cartilage. According to Document [22], the bones of the extremities and those parts of the axial skeleton that bear weight (e.g., vertebrae) develop by endochondral ossification. Document [13] also mentions that most bones including axial (vertebral column and ribs) and appendicular (limbs) skeletons, undergo endochondral ossification. However, the clavicle and sternum are not mentioned in these documents as undergoing endochondral ossification. Therefore, the answer should include the ribs and vertebrae, but not the clavicle and sternum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. The ribs\"}"
