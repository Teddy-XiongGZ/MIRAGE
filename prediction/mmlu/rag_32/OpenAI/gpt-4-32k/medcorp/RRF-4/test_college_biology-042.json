    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The diffusion of a gas across the alveolar membrane is influenced by several factors. According to Fick's law of diffusion, as mentioned in Document [6], the diffusion of gas across the alveolar membrane increases with: Increased surface area of the membrane, Increased alveolar pressure gradient, Increased solubility of the gas, and Decreased membrane thickness. Therefore, decreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas (Choice A) or decreasing the solubility of the gas in water (Choice B) would decrease the rate of diffusion. Decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary (Choice D) would also decrease the rate of diffusion because it would reduce the amount of blood available for gas exchange. On the other hand, increasing the total surface area available for diffusion (Choice C) would increase the rate of diffusion because it would provide more space for gas molecules to move across the alveolar membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
