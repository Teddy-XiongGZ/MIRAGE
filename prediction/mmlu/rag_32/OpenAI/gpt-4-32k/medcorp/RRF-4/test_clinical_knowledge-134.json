    "Step 1: The knee is not a ball and socket joint, it is a hinge joint. So, option A is incorrect. Step 2: A Baker's cyst is usually found in the popliteal fossa, which is located at the back of the knee, not anterior to the knee. So, option B is incorrect. Step 3: The patellar tap test, also known as the bulge sign, is indeed used to demonstrate an effusion in the knee joint. So, option C seems to be correct. Step 4: 'Knock knee' deformity, also known as genu valgum, is a condition where the knees angle in and touch each other when the legs are straightened. It is the opposite of genu varum, which is characterized by outward bowing of the legs. So, option D is incorrect. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: The knee is not a ball and socket joint, it is a hinge joint. So, option A is incorrect.
