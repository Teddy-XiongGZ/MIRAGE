    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metabolism refers to the sum of chemical reactions that occur within each cell of a living organism, providing the body with energy. These reactions are mediated by enzymes, which are proteins with specialized functions in anabolism and catabolism. The proteins that mediate these reactions are formed as dictated by the genetic material of the organism. Therefore, the metabolism of an organism is determined by the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material.\"}"
