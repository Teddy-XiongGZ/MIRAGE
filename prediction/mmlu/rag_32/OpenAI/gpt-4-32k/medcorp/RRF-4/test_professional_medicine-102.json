    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include sudden vision loss and pallor of the optic disk, which are characteristic of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is a common manifestation of multiple sclerosis and is caused by demyelination of the optic nerve. The medial longitudinal fasciculus, when demyelinated, would cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which is characterized by impaired horizontal eye movements, not vision loss. Demyelination of the oculomotor nerve would cause symptoms such as ptosis, diplopia, and eye movement abnormalities, which are not present in this patient. The trigeminal nerve is responsible for facial sensation and mastication, not vision.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Optic nerve\"}"
