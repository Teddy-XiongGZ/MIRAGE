    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of sandblasting and smoking, physical examination findings of cyanosis and clubbing, and chest x-ray findings of hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes are consistent with silicosis, a form of pneumoconiosis. Silicosis is a fibrotic lung disease caused by inhalation of free crystalline silicon dioxide or silica. Occupational exposure to silica dust occurs in a variety of industries and occupations due to the wide use of silica in the industrial sector. The patient's severe hypoxemia (oxygen saturation of 70% on room air) is likely due to his underlying lung disease. The most appropriate intervention for this patient is to provide supplemental oxygen. Long-term oxygen therapy improves survival in patients with severe resting hypoxemia (PaO2 \u226455 mm Hg or SpO2 \u226488%).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Continuous humidified oxygen\"}"
