    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about mobile regions of DNA that can insert themselves into an existing genome. Prions are misfolded proteins that can cause disease, so they are not the correct answer. Cistrons are a term used to refer to a gene, which is not what the question is asking about. Introns are non-coding regions of DNA within a gene, but they do not move or insert themselves into the genome. Transposons, also known as 'jumping genes', are segments of DNA that can move from one part of the genome to another. This matches the description in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
