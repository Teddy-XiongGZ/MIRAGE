    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-chromosome inactivation is a process that occurs in female mammals to balance the dosage of X-linked genes between males and females. This is because females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y chromosome. The process involves turning off one of the two X chromosomes in each cell of a female mammal, which aligns with option A. Option B is incorrect because the choice of which X chromosome will be inactivated is random in each cell, not the same across all cells. Option C is incorrect because X-chromosome inactivation does not affect the Y chromosome. Option D is also incorrect because X-chromosome inactivation does occur in mammals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
