    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a pelvic fracture due to a high-energy trauma, which is commonly associated with urethral injuries. The urethra is divided into four parts: the intramural (or pre-prostatic), prostatic, membranous, and spongy urethra. The membranous urethra, which is the shortest, least distensible part of the urethra that passes through the urogenital diaphragm, is the most susceptible to injury. This is because it is fixed in position and thus vulnerable to shearing forces, especially in the setting of a pelvic fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Membranous\"}"
