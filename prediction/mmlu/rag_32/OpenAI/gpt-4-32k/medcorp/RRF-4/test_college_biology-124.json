    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A fixed action pattern is an instinctive behavioral sequence that is highly stereotyped and species-characteristic. It is produced by the innate releasing mechanism, a 'hard-wired' neural network, in response to a sign/key stimulus or releaser. Once released, a fixed action pattern runs to completion. This means it is not terminated spontaneously, ruling out option C. It is not learned or dependent on experience, so it does not occur the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus, ruling out option A. It is not performed in the absence of sensory feedback, as it is triggered by a specific stimulus, ruling out option B. This leaves us with option D, which states that a fixed action pattern is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment. This aligns with the definition of a fixed action pattern being triggered by a specific stimulus or releaser.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
