    "First, let's understand what each phase represents: - G0 phase: This is a resting phase where the cell is neither dividing nor preparing to divide. - G2 phase: This is the third subphase of interphase in the cell cycle directly preceding mitosis. It follows the successful completion of S phase, during which the cell\u2019s DNA is replicated. - S phase: This is the part of the cell cycle in which DNA is replicated, preparing the cell for division. Now, let's look at the documents to see which of these phases are common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis: - Document [2] and [19] mention that the preparatory steps that lead up to meiosis are identical in pattern and name to interphase of the mitotic cell cycle, which includes the G1, S, and G2 phases. This indicates that both G2 and S phases are common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis. - Document [6] and [7] mention that cells may temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter G0 phase to stop dividing. However, it does not specify whether this applies to cells undergoing meiosis. Based on this information, it seems that G2 and S phases are common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis, but it's not clear if G0 phase is common to both. Therefore, the answer should be \"II and III only\". So, the final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I understood what each phase represents.
