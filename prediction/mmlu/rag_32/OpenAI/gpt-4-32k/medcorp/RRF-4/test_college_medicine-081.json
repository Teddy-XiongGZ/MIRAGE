    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to generate energy. According to Document [4], glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvic acid. Document [5] also states that glycolysis is the process of breaking down a glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules. Therefore, the correct answer should involve the conversion of glucose to pyruvate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. glycogen or glucose to pyruvate or lactate.\"}"
