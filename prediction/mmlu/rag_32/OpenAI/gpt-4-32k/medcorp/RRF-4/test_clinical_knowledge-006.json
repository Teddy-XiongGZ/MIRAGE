    "Step 1: Review the question and the potential choices. The question is asking for a true statement about diplopia. Step 2: Review the relevant documents. Document [25] states that binocular diplopia is only present when both eyes are open and can see, and it disappears when one eye is covered. This contradicts choice A, which states that diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered. Step 3: Document [18] states that the image projected farther from the center is attributable to the eye with the paretic muscle. This contradicts choice B, which states that the outer image is always the false image. Step 4: Document [28] shows that a fourth nerve palsy causes vertical diplopia, which increases when looking to the right and down, not upwards. This contradicts choice C. Step 5: Document [27] states that the most common cause of acute diplopia are ocular motor nerve palsies, which include the sixth cranial nerve. A sixth nerve palsy would cause the affected eye to deviate medially, causing a divergent squint. This supports choice D. Based on the information from the documents, the correct answer is D.
