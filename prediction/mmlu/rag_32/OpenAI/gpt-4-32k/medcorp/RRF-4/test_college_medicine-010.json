    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Strong acids are characterized by their ability to dissociate completely in water, releasing a proton (H+) and forming a stable conjugate base. This is because the strength of an acid is determined by its ability to donate a proton. The acid dissociation constant, Ka, is used to measure the strength of an acid. For strong acids, Ka is greater than 1, not less than 1. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is not a characteristic of strong acids, so it is also incorrect. Option D is incorrect because strong acids do not remain bound in the presence of water; instead, they dissociate completely. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, which states that strong acids have stable conjugate bases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
