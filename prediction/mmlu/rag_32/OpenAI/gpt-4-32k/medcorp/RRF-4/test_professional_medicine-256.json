    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with urticaria, which is a common condition characterized by hives. The cause of urticaria can often be difficult to determine, and in many cases, it is idiopathic, meaning no cause can be found. The documents suggest that a thorough history and physical examination are vital for accurate diagnosis of urticaria. However, in this case, the history and physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Extended laboratory tests, such as determining the serum IgE concentration or the total eosinophil count, rarely yield clinically significant or actionable findings, and hence are not recommended. Referring the patient to an allergist might be an option if there were indications of an allergic cause, but the question does not provide any such indications. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to treat the symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Treat the symptoms\"}"
