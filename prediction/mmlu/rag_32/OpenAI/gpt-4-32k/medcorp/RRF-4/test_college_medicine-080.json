    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a modification in an RNA strand that originally produces a transmembrane protein. The modification is a single nucleotide change from 'U' to 'C'. This change could potentially alter the codon that it is part of, which in turn could alter the amino acid that is incorporated during protein synthesis. This would not necessarily stop the production of the protein or change its size, but it could alter its function if the change in amino acid sequence affects a critical part of the protein. Therefore, the most likely outcome of this modification is the production of a similar-sized but potentially dysfunctional protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
