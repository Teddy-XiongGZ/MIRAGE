    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that the heart undergoes as it beats. It consists of two main phases: diastole and systole. Diastole is the phase during which the heart relaxes and fills with blood. Systole is the phase during which the heart contracts and pumps blood out. There is no phase called 'rest' in the cardiac cycle, and 'contraction' is essentially the same as 'systole'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. diastole and systole.\"}"
