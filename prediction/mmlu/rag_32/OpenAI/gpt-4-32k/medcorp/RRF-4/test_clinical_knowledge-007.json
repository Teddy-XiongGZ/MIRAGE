    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium bicarbonate ingestion is known to increase the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid. This is because sodium bicarbonate is a base and can neutralize acids, thus increasing the pH. The increased buffering capacity can help to neutralize the hydrogen ions produced during high-intensity exercise, which can cause muscle fatigue. Therefore, the ingestion of sodium bicarbonate can potentially improve performance by delaying the onset of muscle fatigue. The efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle into the extracellular fluid would be faster, not slower, in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is that sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance by elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
