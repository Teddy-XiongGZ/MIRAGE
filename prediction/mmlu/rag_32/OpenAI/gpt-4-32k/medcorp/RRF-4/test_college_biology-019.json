    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Leaching is the process where nutrients are washed from the soil by rainfall. The document [0] mentions that leaching happens regularly in wet tropical forests due to heavy rainfall. This leads to a rapid loss of nutrients from the soil. Therefore, the tropical rain forest biome would have a high rate of leaching. The other biomes like Tundra, Taiga, and Desert are typically characterized by cold or dry climates, which would not favor high rates of leaching and nutrient cycling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
