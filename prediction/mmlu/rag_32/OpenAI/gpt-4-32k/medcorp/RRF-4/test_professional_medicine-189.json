    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of normal female body habitus, normal breast development, and normal appearing external genitalia, but absence of axillary or pubic hair suggests that she has been exposed to estrogen (which leads to breast development and female body habitus) but not to androgens (which lead to the development of axillary and pubic hair). This pattern is consistent with androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition in which cells are unable to respond to androgens, leading to a female phenotype in an individual with a 46,XY karyotype. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia typically presents with ambiguous or male-appearing genitalia in genetic females, which is not the case here. Ectodermal dysplasia is a group of disorders characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal structures such as the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands, which is not indicated in this case. A psychiatric disorder would not explain the physical findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
