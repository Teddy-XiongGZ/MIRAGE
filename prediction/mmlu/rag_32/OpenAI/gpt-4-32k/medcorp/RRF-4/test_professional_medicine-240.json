    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and salty sweat are indicative of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that two copies of an abnormal gene must be present for the disease to develop. The patient has been found to have one detectable mutation (G551D) in the CFTR gene, which is associated with CF. However, since CF is a recessive disorder, the presence of a single mutation would not typically result in the disease. Therefore, it is likely that the patient has a second mutation in the CFTR gene that was not detected by the testing obtained.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
