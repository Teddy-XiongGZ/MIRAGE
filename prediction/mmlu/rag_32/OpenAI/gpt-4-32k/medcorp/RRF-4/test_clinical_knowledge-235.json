    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that high-intensity exercise can lead to changes in blood glucose levels. Document [0] suggests that intermittent high-intensity exercise is associated with delayed nocturnal hypoglycemia, indicating a decrease in blood glucose levels. Document [1] also suggests that high-intensity exercise can lead to less post-exercise hypoglycemia. Document [2] suggests that the decline in blood glucose levels is less with intermittent high-intensity exercise compared with moderate-intensity exercise. Document [18] suggests that during high-intensity exercise and early recovery, there is an increase in lag time and a related decline in accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring, compared to pre-exercise and later recovery, in patients with type 1 diabetes. Document [29] suggests that a single bout of moderate-intensity exercise can substantially improve glycemic control throughout the subsequent day in insulin- and non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. Based on these documents, it seems that blood glucose levels can decrease during high-intensity exercise, but the decrease is less than that during moderate-intensity exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
