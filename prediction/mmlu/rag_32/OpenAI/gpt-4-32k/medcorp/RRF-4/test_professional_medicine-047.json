    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Starling forces that govern glomerular filtration include the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space, and the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space. When the efferent arteriole is constricted, this would increase the resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus. As a result, blood would accumulate in the glomerular capillaries, leading to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure within these capillaries. This increased pressure would then drive more fluid out of the capillaries and into Bowman's space, increasing the rate of glomerular filtration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased hydrostatic pressure\"}"
