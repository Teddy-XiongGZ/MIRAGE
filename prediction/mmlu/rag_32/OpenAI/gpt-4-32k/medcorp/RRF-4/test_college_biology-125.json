    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [27] mentions that hummingbird-pollinated flowers are often red and pendulous, which means they hang down. This is because hummingbirds are attracted to red and can hover to feed from hanging flowers, unlike bees. Document [24] also supports this, stating that hummingbird-pollinated flowers are often red and less reflective in the ultraviolet spectrum, which is more visible to bees. Therefore, having pendant, red-colored flowers would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers\"}"
