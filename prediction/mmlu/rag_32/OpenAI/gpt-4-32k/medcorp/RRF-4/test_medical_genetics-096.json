    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ammonia is produced in the body during normal protein metabolism and by intestinal bacteria. The liver plays a role in the detoxification of ammonia by converting it to urea, which is excreted by the kidneys. When there is a defect in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as ornithine transcarbamylase, it can lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood, a condition known as hyperammonemia. Galactosaemia, Hurler's syndrome, and phenylketonuria are all metabolic disorders, but they do not directly involve the urea cycle or ammonia metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
