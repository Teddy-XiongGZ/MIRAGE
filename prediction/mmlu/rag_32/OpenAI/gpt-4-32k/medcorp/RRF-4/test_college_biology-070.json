    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the class of immunoglobulins that have epsilon heavy chains and are located on the plasma membranes of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes. From the documents, it is clear that Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is the class of antibodies that fits this description. Document [0] states that only IgE binds to the high-affinity Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils. Document [3] also mentions that Fc epsilon RI binds the Fc domain of IgE. Therefore, the answer is IgE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
