    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cohesion-tension theory explains the ascent of water in plants. According to this theory, the evaporation of water from the leaves generates tension in the water column, which pulls water upwards from the roots through the xylem. This process is facilitated by the cohesion of water molecules to each other and their adhesion to the walls of the xylem vessels. The theory does not involve water moving from a region of high hydrostatic pressure to a region of low hydrostatic pressure, nor does it attribute the formation of embolisms to the cohesion of water molecules. Also, the xylem vessels, which are the main conduits for water ascent, are typically non-living cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
