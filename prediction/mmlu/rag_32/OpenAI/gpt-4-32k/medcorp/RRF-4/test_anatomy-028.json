    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the organ most likely to be involved in a severe blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen. The appendix and gallbladder are located in the right side of the abdomen, so they can be ruled out. The urinary bladder is located in the lower abdomen, so it is also unlikely to be involved. The spleen is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, so it is the most likely organ to be involved in a severe blunt trauma to this area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Spleen\"}"
