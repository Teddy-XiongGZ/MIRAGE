    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the diagnostic use of variation in serial peak flow readings over a two-week period. Peak flow readings are a measure of how fast a person can blow out air from their lungs, and are often used to monitor conditions that affect the airways, such as asthma. Document [13] mentions that numerical indices of peak flow variability are highly valid tests for asthma. Document [30] also mentions that serial measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) is the most appropriate initial confirmatory test for occupational asthma. Therefore, the answer is likely to be asthma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
