    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, we know that the oxidation of one NADH molecule can generate approximately 3 ATP molecules, while the oxidation of one FADH2 molecule can generate approximately 2 ATP molecules. Therefore, if we have one pair of electrons each from NADH and FADH2, we would have a total of 3 ATP from NADH and 2 ATP from FADH2, which gives us a total of 5 ATP molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
