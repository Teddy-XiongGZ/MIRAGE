    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle via a transport system. This is not a simple diffusion process, as it involves specific transporters. The documents do not mention carnosine as a cotransporter with lactate and hydrogen ions. Also, the process is not described as an active transport mechanism. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle via a protein transporter molecule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
