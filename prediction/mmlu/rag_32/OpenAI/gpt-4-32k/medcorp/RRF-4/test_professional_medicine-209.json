    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, tachycardia, and hemoptysis, along with physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds at the lung bases, expiratory crackles, an irregularly irregular rhythm, a loud S1, and a low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur at the apex, are indicative of a heart condition. The presence of a distinct snapping sound before the murmur is a key clue to the diagnosis. This sound is characteristic of the opening snap in mitral stenosis, which occurs due to abrupt halt in leaflet motion in diastole, after the rapid opening phase. The murmur of mitral stenosis is a diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex in the left lateral decubitus position. The patient's irregularly irregular rhythm suggests atrial fibrillation, a common complication of mitral stenosis due to left atrial enlargement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
