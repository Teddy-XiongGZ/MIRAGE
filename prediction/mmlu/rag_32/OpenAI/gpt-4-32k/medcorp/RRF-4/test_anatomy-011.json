    "First, I need to understand the function of the third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve. According to Document [20], the oculomotor nerve supplies the majority of the muscles controlling eye movements and also supplies the upper eyelid muscle and the muscles responsible for pupil constriction. Damage to this nerve results in an inability to move the eye normally and is known by its down and out symptoms, because of the position of the affected eye (lateral, downward deviation of gaze). Next, I need to understand the terms in the answer choices. Pupillary constriction refers to the narrowing of the pupil, while pupillary dilatation refers to the widening of the pupil. Medial strabismus refers to the inward deviation of the eye, while lateral strabismus refers to the outward deviation of the eye. Given the function of the oculomotor nerve, damage to this nerve would likely result in pupillary dilatation (due to loss of the ability to constrict the pupil) and lateral strabismus (due to the 'down and out' position of the affected eye). Therefore, the answer is D. Pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the function of the third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve.
