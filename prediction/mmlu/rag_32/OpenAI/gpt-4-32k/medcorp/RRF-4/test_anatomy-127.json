    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The vital centers of the brainstem are responsible for controlling essential functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. According to Document [0], these centers are located throughout the brainstem, including the medulla oblongata. Document [22] also mentions that the medulla oblongata is responsible for autonomic functions, including the regulation of blood pressure, pulse, and cardiac contractions. Document [6] states that the cardiovascular center, which regulates heart rate, is part of the medulla oblongata. Document [9] mentions that the respiratory center is located in the medulla oblongata and pons. However, the question specifically asks for the location of the 'vital centers', which are most commonly associated with life-sustaining functions such as heart rate and respiration. Therefore, the medulla oblongata is the most accurate answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
