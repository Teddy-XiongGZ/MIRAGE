    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities is likely due to metabolic changes in the muscle. This could be due to the depletion of energy substrates or the accumulation of metabolic by-products. Among the options, the accumulation of inorganic phosphate is a metabolic by-product that could contribute to muscle fatigue. Hyperosmolality refers to an excess of solutes in the body fluids and is not directly related to muscle fatigue. Antioxidants are molecules that can prevent damage to cells and are not typically associated with muscle fatigue. Potassium is an important electrolyte for muscle function, but a lack of potassium is more associated with muscle weakness or cramps rather than fatigue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
