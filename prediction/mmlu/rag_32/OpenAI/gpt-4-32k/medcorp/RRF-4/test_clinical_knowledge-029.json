    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle via a transport system. Document [12] specifically mentions that the efflux of H+ and lactate might be mediated by the lactate/proton co-transport system found in almost all cell types in the body. Document [17] also mentions that lactate-proton transport across cellular membranes occurs by means of facilitated exchange along pH and concentration gradients involving a family of lactate transport proteins, now called monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Therefore, the answer is not simple diffusion or active transport, and there is no mention of carnosine. The answer is that lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle via a protein transporter molecule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
