    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fainting and fatigue, along with the physical examination finding of cannon a waves, suggest a cardiac conduction problem. The ECG findings of a P-wave rate of 90/min and an R-wave rate of 40/min with no apparent relation between the two indicate complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity. This is characteristic of third-degree atrioventricular block, also known as complete heart block, where the atria and ventricles beat independently of each other. Right bundle branch block would typically present with a characteristic pattern on ECG, which is not described here. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I (Wenckebach) typically presents with progressive PR interval lengthening until a beat is dropped, which is not described in this case. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II typically presents with dropped beats without preceding PR interval lengthening, which is also not described in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
