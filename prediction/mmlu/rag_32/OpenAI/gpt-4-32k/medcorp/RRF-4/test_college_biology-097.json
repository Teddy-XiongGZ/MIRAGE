    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antibiotics work by targeting specific functions or processes in bacterial cells. According to the documents, antibiotics can interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis, which is involved in the formation of the bacterial cell wall (Document 0, Document 16, Document 27). They can also inhibit protein synthesis, which is crucial for the growth and replication of bacteria (Document 0, Document 1, Document 2, Document 12, Document 13, Document 19, Document 22, Document 24, Document 26, Document 28, Document 31). Furthermore, some antibiotics can affect DNA synthesis in bacteria (Document 2). However, there is no mention in the documents of antibiotics interfering with reverse transcriptase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of DNA from an RNA template. This process is not typically found in bacteria but is common in retroviruses like HIV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
