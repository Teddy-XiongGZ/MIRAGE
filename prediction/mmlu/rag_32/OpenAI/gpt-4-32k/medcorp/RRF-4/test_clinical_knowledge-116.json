    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The work of breathing is the energy expended to inhale and exhale a breathing gas. It can increase considerably due to illness or constraints on gas flow imposed by breathing apparatus, ambient pressure, or breathing gas composition. An increase in the respiratory rate (Choice A) would likely increase the work of breathing as more breaths are being taken. The use of accessory muscles (Choice C) would also increase the work of breathing as these muscles are not typically used for normal, relaxed breathing. Noisy breathing (Choice B) could be a sign of increased work of breathing, but it is not a direct cause of increased work of breathing. A respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (Choice D) is considered normal for an adult at rest, and would not necessarily increase the work of breathing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
