    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that blood lactate was 6.0+/-0.4 and 5.0+/-0.4 mM during the first and second halves, respectively. This indicates that blood lactate concentration decreases in the second half of the game. Document [12] also mentions that blood lactate concentration is lowered during the second half of the game. Document [19] states that blood lactate concentration was 4-5 mmol/L during the game, which is higher than 3 mM. Therefore, options A and D can be eliminated. Between options B and C, the evidence from the documents supports option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
