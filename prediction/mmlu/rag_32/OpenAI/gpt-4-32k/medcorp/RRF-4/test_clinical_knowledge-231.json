    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that during endurance exercise, glycogen stores in slow twitch (ST) fibres are utilised initially, followed by stores in fast twitch a (FTa) then fast twitch b (FTb) fibres. Document [25] also mentions that during a 30-second all-out sprint, glycogen degradation was most pronounced in type I fibres. Document [27] also states that during high-intensity intermittent short sprints, the slow twitch fibres exhibit a greater oxidative capacity. These documents suggest that type I fibres, which are slow twitch fibres, are the first to fatigue during all-out exercise such as sprinting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
