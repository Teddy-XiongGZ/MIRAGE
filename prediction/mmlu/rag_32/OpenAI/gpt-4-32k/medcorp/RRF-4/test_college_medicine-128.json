    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen breakdown, also known as glycogenolysis, occurs in the cells of muscle and liver tissues. In muscle cells, glycogen degradation serves to provide an immediate source of glucose-6-phosphate for glycolysis, to provide energy for muscle contraction. However, the initial product of glycogen breakdown in muscle is glucose-1-phosphate, which can then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. glucose-1-phosphate.\"}"
