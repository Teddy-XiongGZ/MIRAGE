IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that affects the large intestine, or colon. The sympathetic nervous system, which is part of the autonomic nervous system, plays a role in the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract. The sympathetic innervation to the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon, originates from the thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord. Specifically, the sympathetic innervation to the colon originates from the lower thoracic and upper lumbar segments, which corresponds to T7-L2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. T7-L2\"}"
