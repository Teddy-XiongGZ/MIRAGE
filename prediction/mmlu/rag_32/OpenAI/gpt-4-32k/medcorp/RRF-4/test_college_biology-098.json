    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it's asking. The question is asking about the characteristics of polytene chromosomes in Drosophila silvarentis when viewed with a light microscope. Step 2: Review the answer choices. The choices are about the activity, production, and nature of polytene chromosomes. Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [3] states that polytene chromosomes are seen to have distinct thick and thin banding patterns and are used to study the function of genes in transcription, which contradicts choice A. Document [4] mentions that each chromosome has undergone multiple rounds of replication, contradicting choice B. Document [22] explains that the large size of the chromosome is due to the presence of many longitudinal strands called chromonemata; hence the name polytene (many stranded). They are formed after repeated division of the chromosome in the absence of cytoplasmic division, which supports choice C. Document [4] also mentions that each chromosome is tightly paired with its homolog, which contradicts choice D. Step 4: Choose the best answer based on the information from the documents. The best answer is C. Polytene chromosomes are produced by repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division.
