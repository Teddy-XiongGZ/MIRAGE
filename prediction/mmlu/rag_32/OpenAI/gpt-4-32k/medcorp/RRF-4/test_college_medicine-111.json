    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about Boyle's law, which states that the volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely related to pressure when the temperature is constant. This can be represented by the formula P1V1 = P2V2, where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume. In this case, we know that P1 = 200atm, V1 = 0.1L, and P2 = 1atm. We can solve for V2 by rearranging the formula to get V2 = P1V1 / P2. Substituting the known values, we get V2 = 200atm * 0.1L / 1atm = 20L.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 20L\"}"
