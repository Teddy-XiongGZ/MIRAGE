    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what an amino acid is. From Document [0], I learned that amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino and carboxylate functional groups, along with a side chain specific to each amino acid. The elements present in every amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Some amino acids also contain sulfur or selenium. Now, I need to check each of the options against this definition. Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamine are all mentioned in the documents as amino acids. However, palmitic acid is not mentioned in any of the documents as an amino acid. Therefore, palmitic acid is not an amino acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Palmitic acid\"}"
