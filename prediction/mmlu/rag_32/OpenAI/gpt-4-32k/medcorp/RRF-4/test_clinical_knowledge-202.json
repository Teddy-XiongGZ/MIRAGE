    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that ATP and phosphocreatine are the primary sources of energy for high-intensity, short-duration exercise. Document [1] states that the phosphocreatine system, which is the most rapid source of energy, lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high-intensity exercise. Document [4] also mentions that ATP restoration lasts for approximately the first 30 seconds of exercise. Document [21] states that the phosphagen system, which uses phosphocreatine, allows for exercise lasting up to ten seconds. Therefore, the energy from ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 30 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
