    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fast-twitch fibers are mentioned in several documents. Document [0] states that fast-twitch fibers have a high capability for electrochemical transmission of action potentials and a rapid level of calcium release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. They rely on a well-developed, anaerobic, short term, glycolytic system for energy transfer. This suggests that they have high ATPase activity. Document [22] mentions that the motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first. The high oxidative capacity of slow muscle, coupled with the low myosin ATPase activity, helps reduce the susceptibility to fatigue in slow muscle. This suggests that fast-twitch fibers have a relatively small number of mitochondria, which are associated with oxidative capacity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
