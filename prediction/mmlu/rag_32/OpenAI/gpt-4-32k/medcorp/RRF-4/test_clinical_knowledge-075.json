    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that the total stretch time in a day is more important than the actual single stretch duration time. It compares two protocols, a 10-second duration stretch and a 30-second duration stretch, and finds no differences in the results. Document [1] suggests that each stretch should be held for a minimum of 10\u201320 seconds. Document [2] suggests that a duration of 30 seconds is an effective time of stretching for enhancing the flexibility of the hamstring muscles. Document [4] suggests that significant increases in knee extension ROM diminished at the fifth stretch repetition of 15 seconds. Document [5] concludes that 30 s of static stretching is sufficient enough to alter mechanical properties of plantar flexor muscles. Document [10] suggests that one static stretch of 15 to 30 seconds per day is sufficient for most patients. Document [13] suggests that holding stretches for 15 seconds, as opposed to five seconds, may result in greater improvements in active ROM. Document [16] suggests that higher stretch duration seems to be a crucial factor for passive torque decrease and higher stretch intensity for maximum angle increase. Document [21] suggests that manual stretches such as flexion, extension, the lateral rotation should be done at least three times a week in a set of 15 stretches with each stretch for about a second with a 10 seconds pause in between. Document [27] suggests that a 1-min cycle (stretching for 15 sec, relaxing for 15 sec and resting for 30 sec) was applied over a time period ranging from 5 to 60 min. Document [31] suggests that each stretch was held for 30 seconds and was repeated 4 times on each leg and repeated after 4 minutes of rest. Based on these documents, it seems that the minimum time a stretch should be held for ranges from 10 to 30 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
