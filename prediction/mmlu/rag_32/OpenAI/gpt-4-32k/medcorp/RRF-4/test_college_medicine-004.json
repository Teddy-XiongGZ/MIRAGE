    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This is a physics problem. We can use the equation of motion v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the distance. The car starts from rest, so u = 0. The final velocity v is given as 130 km/h, which we need to convert to m/s by multiplying by 1000 to convert km to m, and dividing by 3600 to convert hours to seconds. So, v = 130 * 1000 / 3600 = 36.11 m/s. The distance s is given as 50 m. Substituting these values into the equation, we get (36.11)^2 = 2 * a * 50. Solving for a gives us the acceleration needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 26 m/s^2\"}"
