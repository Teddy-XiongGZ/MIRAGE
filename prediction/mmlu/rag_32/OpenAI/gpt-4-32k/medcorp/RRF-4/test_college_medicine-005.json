    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. However, long-chain fatty acids cannot freely diffuse across the mitochondrial membrane. According to the documents, they must first be converted to fatty acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetase. Then, the fatty acyl-CoA is transported into the mitochondria through a process involving carnitine. The fatty acyl-CoA is converted to fatty acyl-carnitine by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I), and this fatty acyl-carnitine is then transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by carnitine acyl-translocase (CAT). Therefore, the fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to carnitine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. carnitine\"}"
