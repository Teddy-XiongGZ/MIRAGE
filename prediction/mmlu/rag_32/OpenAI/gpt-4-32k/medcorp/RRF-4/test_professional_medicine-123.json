    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include a 'blank stare', flat facial expression, catatonia, rigidity, and sudden hostility. These symptoms suggest a state of altered consciousness and aggressive behavior. Looking at the options, diazepam is a benzodiazepine used for its sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant properties, and it is unlikely to cause aggression. Methamphetamine is a stimulant that can cause euphoria, increased energy, and increased sociability, but it is not typically associated with catatonia or rigidity. Oxycodone is an opioid that can cause euphoria, but it also causes respiratory depression and sedation, which are not present in this case. PCP, or phencyclidine, is a dissociative drug that can cause hallucinations, distorted perceptions of sounds, and violent behavior. It can also cause a 'blank stare' and rigidity, which matches the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. PCP (phencyclidine)\"}"
