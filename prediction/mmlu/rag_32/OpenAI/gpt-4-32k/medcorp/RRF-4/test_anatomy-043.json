    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inferior alveolar nerve block is a common technique used in dentistry to induce anesthesia in certain areas of the mouth. According to Document [4], these areas include the skin and mucous membranes of the lower lip, the skin of the chin, the lower teeth and the labial gingiva of the anterior teeth, all unilaterally to the midline of the side on which the block is administered. However, the document also mentions that depending on the technique, the long buccal nerve may not be anesthetized by an IANB and therefore an area of buccal gingiva adjacent to the lower posterior teeth will retain normal sensation unless that nerve is anesthetized separately, via a (long) buccal nerve block. This information suggests that a successful inferior alveolar nerve block will not produce anesthesia of the buccal gingivae of the posterior mandibular teeth unless a separate buccal nerve block is also administered.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
