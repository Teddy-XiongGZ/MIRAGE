    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyperventilation is the process of breathing more rapidly or deeply than normal, which leads to excessive expulsion of circulating carbon dioxide. This is evident from Document [1] and Document [2]. This decrease in carbon dioxide in the blood leads to an increase in blood pH, a condition known as respiratory alkalosis, as stated in Document [1] and Document [5]. An increase in blood pH means a decrease in the concentration of hydrogen ions, as pH is inversely proportional to the concentration of hydrogen ions. Therefore, hyperventilation leads to a decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in the concentration of hydrogen ions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
