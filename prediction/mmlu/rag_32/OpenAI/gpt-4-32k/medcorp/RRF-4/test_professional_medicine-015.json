    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a motor vehicle collision. The most appropriate approach to confirm the diagnosis would be to ask the patient to provide a detailed description of the incident and his symptoms. This would allow the physician to assess the patient's emotional response to the traumatic event, the presence of intrusive thoughts or flashbacks, avoidance behaviors, and symptoms of hyperarousal, which are all characteristic of PTSD. Administering amobarbital, interviewing the patient under hypnosis, or focusing on the patient's willingness to make eye contact are not standard or reliable methods for diagnosing PTSD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
