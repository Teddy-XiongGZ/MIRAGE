    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Homologous structures are those that have a similar structure but may have different functions, indicating a common ancestry. Analogous structures are those that have similar functions but may have different structures, indicating convergent evolution. Vestigial structures are those that have lost their original function through evolution. The wings of a bat and a butterfly have similar functions - they both allow the organism to fly. However, their structures are different. Bat wings are formed by a membrane stretched across elongated fingers, while butterfly wings are made up of scales. Therefore, they are not homologous. They are also not vestigial, as they both serve a crucial function. Therefore, they are analogous structures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
