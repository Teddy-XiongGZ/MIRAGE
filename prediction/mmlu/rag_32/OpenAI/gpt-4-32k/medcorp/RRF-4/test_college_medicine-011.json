    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why 2-butene is the major product in the reaction of 2-bromobutane with ethanol. This is a classic example of an elimination reaction, specifically an E2 reaction, where a strong base (ethanol in this case) abstracts a proton from the carbon adjacent to the one bearing the leaving group (bromine), leading to the formation of a double bond. The major product in such reactions is usually the more substituted alkene, due to its greater stability. This is known as Zaitsev's rule. In this case, 2-butene is more substituted than 1-butene, which explains why it is the major product.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
