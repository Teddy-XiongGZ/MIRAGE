    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a process where DNA is purified and reacted in a mixture with specific oligonucleotides, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. This mixture is then subjected to repetitive cycles of heating and cooling, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. This process is characteristic of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique, which is used to amplify a specific DNA segment from a mixture. The other options, Northern blotting, Reverse transcription, and Southern blotting, do not involve the same process of heating and cooling cycles for DNA amplification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
