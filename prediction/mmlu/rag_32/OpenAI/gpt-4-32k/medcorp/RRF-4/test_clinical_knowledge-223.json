    "Step 1: Review the question and the answer choices. The question is asking for a true statement about rheumatoid arthritis. Step 2: Review each answer choice against the provided documents. A. Rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases - Document [1] states that rheumatoid factor is present in the circulation of persons with a variety of inflammatory conditions, but it does not specify a percentage for rheumatoid arthritis cases. B. It is an example of an oligoarthropathy - Document [0] and [12] describe rheumatoid arthritis as a systemic inflammatory arthritis affecting multiple joints, which contradicts the definition of oligoarthropathy (a condition that affects few joints). C. Anaemia is a common finding - Document [0] mentions that rheumatoid arthritis may impact organs other than the joints, but it does not specifically mention anaemia. However, it is known that anaemia can be a common finding in rheumatoid arthritis due to chronic inflammation. D. Heberden's nodes are a feature - Heberden's nodes are associated with osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis. None of the documents mention Heberden's nodes in relation to rheumatoid arthritis. Step 3: Choose the answer that is most supported by the documents. Based on the information in the documents, the correct answer is C. Anaemia is a common finding.
