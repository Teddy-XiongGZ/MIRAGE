    "Step 1: Review the question and the answer choices. The question is asking about the correct statement concerning a sarcomere of a striated muscle. Step 2: Review the relevant documents. Document [0] provides a general overview of the sarcomere, stating that it is composed of long, fibrous proteins as filaments that slide past each other when a muscle contracts or relaxes. Document [1] discusses the force-length relation in striated muscles and the overlap between myosin and actin filaments within sarcomeres. Document [3] provides more information about the structure of striated muscle tissue, including the sarcomere. Document [7] provides key points about the sarcomere, including that contraction results in shortening of both the H (only thick filaments) and I (only thin filaments) bands. Document [15] mentions that striated muscle fibers contain actin and myosin filaments that power contraction and are organized into repeating arrays, called sarcomeres. Document [26] states that the more the thin and thick filaments overlap, the more the muscle is contracted. Step 3: Match the information from the documents to the answer choices. A. During contraction H zones become elongated. - This is incorrect. According to Document [7], contraction results in shortening of the H bands, not elongation. B. In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin. - This is correct. Tropomyosin is a protein that blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules, preventing contraction. When a muscle cell is stimulated, tropomyosin moves, exposing the binding sites and allowing contraction to occur. C. Each myosin helical tail contains an actinbinding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site. - This is incorrect. The myosin head, not the tail, contains the actin binding site and the ATPase site. D. The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively. - This is incorrect. According to Document [15], actin and myosin filaments power contraction and are organized into repeating arrays, called sarcomeres. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory proteins, not the main constituents of the filaments. Step 4: Choose the correct answer. The correct answer is B. In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin. Final Output in JSON: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first reviewed the question and the answer choices. Then, I reviewed the relevant documents to gather information about the sarcomere of a striated muscle. I matched the information from the documents to the answer choices.
