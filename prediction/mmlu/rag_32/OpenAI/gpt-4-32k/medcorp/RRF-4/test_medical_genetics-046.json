    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a term that describes the phenomenon where one genotype can lead to different physiological or morphological states due to different environmental conditions during development. Looking at the documents, Document [0] defines 'phenotypic plasticity' as changes in an organism's behavior, morphology, and physiology in response to a unique environment. However, this term is not in the options. Document [14] mentions 'developmental plasticity' and describes it as the outcome of a developmental 'programme' coded in its genotype, which is expressed differently depending on environmental conditions. This definition aligns with the description given in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Developmental plasticity\"}"
