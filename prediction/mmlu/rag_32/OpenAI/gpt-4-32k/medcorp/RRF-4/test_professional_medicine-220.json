    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The alpha level in a study is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, which is known as a Type I error. By setting the alpha at a lower level (0.01 instead of 0.05), the study is being more stringent about what it considers to be a statistically significant finding. This means that the study is less likely to make a Type I error, or falsely conclude that the new drug is effective when it is not. Therefore, if the study finds a significant result, we can have greater confidence in this finding because the threshold for significance was set lower. This does not increase the power of the study, which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (i.e., correctly identifying a true effect). Lowering the alpha level does not decrease the likelihood of a Type II error, which is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. Finally, by making the criteria for significance more stringent, there is not an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings; in fact, it is less likely that results will be deemed statistically significant because the bar for significance is higher.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
