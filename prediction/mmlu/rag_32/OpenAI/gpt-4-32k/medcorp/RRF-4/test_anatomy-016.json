    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Quiet inspiration, also known as eupnea, is the natural breathing in all mammals, including humans. During eupnea, neural output to respiratory muscles is highly regular, with rhythmic bursts of activity during inspiration only to the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. The external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm are the primary muscles involved in quiet inspiration. The internal intercostal muscles are not typically involved in quiet inspiration, but are more active during forced expiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
