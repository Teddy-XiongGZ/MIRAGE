    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information in the documents about how plants adapt to minimize water loss in high-temperature environments. Document [0] mentions that plants adapt to dry conditions by reducing the number of leaves and their surface area, which contradicts choice D. The same document also mentions adaptations of the stomata to reduce water loss, but it doesn't specify that there are numerous stomata, which contradicts choice A. Document [16] mentions that the dromedary can conserve water by reducing perspiration by fluctuating the body temperature throughout the day, but this is about animals, not plants. Document [19] mentions that plants in alpine environments are subjected to water stress and have numerous morphological adaptations to reduce transpirational water loss, including thick cuticles, which contradicts choice B. Document [31] mentions that woody-stemmed shrubs and plants in desert regions have evolved to minimize water loss, but it doesn't specify how. However, Document [16] mentions that plants in the desert have spines instead of leaves to reduce water loss, which supports choice C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
