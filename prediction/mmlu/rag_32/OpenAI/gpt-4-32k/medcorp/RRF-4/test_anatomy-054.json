    "The parotid duct, also known as Stensen's duct, is a salivary duct that carries saliva from the parotid gland into the mouth. According to Document [1], the parotid duct runs forward along the lateral side of the masseter muscle and then takes a steep turn at the border of the masseter and passes through the buccinator muscle. It opens into the vestibule of the mouth, the region of the mouth between the cheek and the gums, at the parotid papilla, which lies across the second Maxillary (upper) molar tooth. Therefore, the parotid duct runs deep to the masseter and enters the mouth opposite the upper second molar. So, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parotid duct, also known as Stensen's duct, is a salivary duct that carries saliva from the parotid gland into the mouth.
