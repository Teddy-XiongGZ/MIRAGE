    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a legal term that represents the concept invoked by the patient in a malpractice suit where a surgical sponge was left in her pelvis after a hysterectomy. The term 'res ipsa loquitur' is a Latin phrase that means 'the thing speaks for itself.' In legal terms, it refers to situations where negligence is presumed because the incident could not have occurred without negligence. In this case, the surgical sponge could not have been left in the patient's pelvis unless there was negligence, so the term 'res ipsa loquitur' is the most appropriate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
