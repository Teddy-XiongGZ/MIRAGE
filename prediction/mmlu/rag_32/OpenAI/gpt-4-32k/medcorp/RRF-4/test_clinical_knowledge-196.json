    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A hypertonic solution is defined by its solute concentration relative to another solution. In the context of a cell, a hypertonic solution has a higher concentration of solutes than the cell. This causes water to flow out of the cell to balance the concentrations of the solutes on either side of the cell membrane. This is mentioned in Document [0]. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that states a hypertonic solution has a higher concentration of solutes than a normal human cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
