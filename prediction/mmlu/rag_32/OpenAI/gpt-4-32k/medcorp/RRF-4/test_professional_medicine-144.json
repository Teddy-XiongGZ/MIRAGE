    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of brief, severe, recurrent episodes of facial pain triggered by cold air, chewing, and brushing her teeth are characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). TN is a disorder of the fifth cranial nerve that causes severe facial pain that can be triggered by light touch, eating, or exposure to wind. Carbamazepine is the first-line treatment for TN. It stabilizes the inactivated state of sodium channels, making fewer of these channels available to subsequently open, leading to a reduction in the ability of these nerves to rapidly fire (ie, the frequency of action potential firing is reduced). This reduces the pain caused by TN. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate are antiepileptic drugs that are not first-line treatments for TN.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
