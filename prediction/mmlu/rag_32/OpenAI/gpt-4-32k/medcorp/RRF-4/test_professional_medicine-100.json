    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden onset shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating, along with the physical examination findings of a diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border and decreased femoral pulses bilaterally, are indicative of aortic dissection. This condition is often associated with hypertension, which the patient has. The ECG showing left ventricular hypertrophy further supports this diagnosis, as it is a common finding in patients with chronic hypertension. The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation. Acute myocardial infarction typically presents with chest pain and ECG changes, but not with a diastolic murmur or decreased femoral pulses. Esophageal rupture would likely present with severe chest pain and signs of sepsis, but not with the cardiovascular findings seen in this patient. Mitral valve prolapse would cause a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur, not a diastolic murmur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
