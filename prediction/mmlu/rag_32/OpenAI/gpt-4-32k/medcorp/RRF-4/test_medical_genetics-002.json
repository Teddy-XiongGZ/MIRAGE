    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The frequency of X-linked recessive conditions in females is the square of that in males. This is because females have two X chromosomes and thus must receive two of the mutated recessive X chromosomes (one from each parent) to be affected. So, if the frequency in males is 0.10, the frequency in females will be (0.10)*(0.10) = 0.01.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
