    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that once the blood has been released for the patient, there are 20-30 minutes to begin the transfusion. Document [2] suggests that the 30-minute limit could be extended to 2 hours without any increased risk to the recipient. Document [3] also discusses the '30-minute' and '4-hour' rules in transfusion medicine. The 30-minute rule states that red blood cell (RBC) units left out of controlled temperature storage for more than 30 minutes should not be returned to storage for reissue. The 4-hour rule states that transfusion of RBC units should be completed within 4 hours of their removal from controlled temperature storage. However, the question asks about the time before the blood product starts to deteriorate, not the time to complete the transfusion. Therefore, based on the information from these documents, the answer should be 30 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
