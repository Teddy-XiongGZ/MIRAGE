    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking about the characteristics of exons in protein-coding genes. Step 2: Review each answer choice individually and cross-reference with the provided documents. Choice A: Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA. Document [16] states that protein-coding sequences constitute less than 1.5% of the human genome, and the entire set of exons constitutes the exome. This suggests that not all exons are coding, supporting choice A. Choice B: The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site. Document [7] states that the coding region of a gene, also known as the coding DNA sequence (CDS), is the portion of a gene's DNA or RNA that codes for protein. However, it does not specify that the first exon always contains the translational start site. Choice C: The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon. Document [7] also does not specify that the last exon always contains the normal termination codon. Choice D: A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames. Document [0] mentions that the human \u03b1-tropomyosin gene is alternatively spliced to produce different forms of \u03b1-tropomyosin mRNA in different cell types. This suggests that a coding exon can be translated in more than one forward reading frame, contradicting choice D. Step 3: Based on the information from the documents, choice A seems to be the most accurate. The final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each answer choice individually and cross-referenced with the provided documents. Based on the information from the documents, choice A seems to be the most accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
