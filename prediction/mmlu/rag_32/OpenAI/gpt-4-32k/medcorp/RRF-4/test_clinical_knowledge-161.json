    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. From the documents, it is clear that glycolysis results in the net production of 2 ATP molecules from glucose. The question does not provide information about glycogen, but since glycogen is a storage form of glucose, it can be broken down into glucose units that then enter glycolysis. Therefore, the net ATP production from each glucose unit derived from glycogen would also be 2 ATP. However, the question does not specify how many glucose units are derived from the glycogen molecule, so we cannot determine the total ATP production from glycogen. Therefore, the answer should be the option that correctly states the ATP production from glucose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
