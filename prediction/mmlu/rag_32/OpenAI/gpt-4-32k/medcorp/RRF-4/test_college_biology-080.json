    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cancer cells and normal cells have different characteristics when grown in culture. According to Document [24], normal cells have a limited capacity for replication, known as the Hayflick limit, while cancer cells are immortal and can divide indefinitely. This rules out option D. Document [14] mentions that normal cells will not divide unless they are attached to the substratum, while transformed (cancer) cells will often divide even if held in suspension, which rules out option C. Document [10] also mentions that transformed cell lines often grow without attaching to a surface. Document [14] also mentions that normal cells become inhibited by contact with each other, while cancer cells do not display this contact inhibition, which supports option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
