    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a long-term smoker with a history of asthma. She presents with a large right lower lobe mass and scattered calcifications, as well as right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is also a mass in the right adrenal gland. Given her history of smoking and the presentation of her symptoms, a lung-related issue is most likely. Mesothelioma is typically associated with asbestos exposure, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast is less likely given the lack of breast-related symptoms or history. Multiple endocrine neoplasia typically presents with symptoms related to overproduction of hormones, which is not the case here. Non-small cell lung carcinoma is a common type of lung cancer and is strongly associated with smoking, making it the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
