    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique in molecular biology that is used to amplify specific DNA sequences. This is achieved by using short DNA primers and a thermostable DNA polymerase, as mentioned in Document [20]. It does not demonstrate DNA as the genetic material, nor does it determine the content of minerals in a soil sample, or measure the ribosome transfer rate during translation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
