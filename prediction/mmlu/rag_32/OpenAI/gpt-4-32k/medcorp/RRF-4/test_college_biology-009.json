    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Influenza viruses are RNA viruses, not DNA viruses, so they do not incorporate viral DNA into the host cell\u2019s chromosome, which eliminates option A. They do not destroy the host cell\u2019s transcriptional machinery, so option B is also incorrect. Influenza viruses do not use reverse transcriptase to manufacture viral DNA, so option D is incorrect. According to Document [2], [4], and [5], after entering a cell, influenza viruses replicate their genetic material and synthesize viral proteins, which matches option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
