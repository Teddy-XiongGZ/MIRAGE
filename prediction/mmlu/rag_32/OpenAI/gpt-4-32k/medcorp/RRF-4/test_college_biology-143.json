    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose involves the movement of sucrose through the cytoplasm of cells, facilitated by plasmodesmata, which are channels between cells. The pathway starts from the site of photosynthesis, which is the mesophyll cells. From the mesophyll cells, the sucrose moves to the bundle sheath cells, which are the cells surrounding the veins in the leaf. From the bundle sheath, the sucrose moves to the phloem parenchyma, which are the cells that surround the sieve tube and companion cells in the phloem. Finally, the sucrose moves to the companion cells and then to the sieve tube, which is responsible for the long-distance transport of the sucrose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
