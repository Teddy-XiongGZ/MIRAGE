    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that mtDNA is a popular population genetic marker. Document [1] explains that the rapid mutation rate of mtDNA in animals makes it useful for assessing genetic relationships within a species and for identifying and quantifying the evolutionary relationships among different species. Document [2] also mentions that mtDNA is the most used genetic marker for species identification because it is easier to type from highly decomposed and processed tissue compared to nuclear DNA. Document [4] mentions that mtDNA is useful for identification of the source of a biological sample, or to confirm matrilineal relatedness. Document [16] also mentions that mtDNA is conserved across eukaryotic organisms and due to its relatively high mutation rate, it is useful for studying the evolutionary relationships of organisms. From these documents, it is clear that mtDNA is used to study the relatedness of animal populations because it is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes, and not because it mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
