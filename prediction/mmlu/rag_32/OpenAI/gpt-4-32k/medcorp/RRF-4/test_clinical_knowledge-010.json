    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the blood compatibility for a person with blood group B (rhesus negative). From Document [2], I learned that a group B individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups B or O, with B being preferable. However, the rhesus factor also plays a role in blood compatibility. From Document [19], I understand that the presence or absence of the Rh(D) antigen is signified by the + or - sign. Therefore, a person with a negative rhesus factor can only receive blood from other individuals with a negative rhesus factor. Combining these two pieces of information, a person with blood group B (rhesus negative) can receive blood from individuals with blood group B (rhesus negative) and blood group O (rhesus negative).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
