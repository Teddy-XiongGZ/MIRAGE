    "The Doppler effect or Doppler shift is the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. The Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency is determined by the speed of sound in the medium and the frequency of the emitted sound. The time of interaction between the sound source and detector, and the distance between the source and detector are not directly involved in determining the Doppler shift. Therefore, the answer is D. I and IV. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Doppler effect or Doppler shift is the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.
