    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insensible loss refers to the loss of water from the body that is not easily measured. This can occur through the skin, respiratory system, and in stool. Pyrexia, or fever, can increase insensible water loss through increased perspiration. Using unhumidified oxygen can also lead to insensible water loss as it can dry out the respiratory tract. Diarrhoea can lead to insensible water loss as it can result in increased water loss in stool. However, excessive weight loss is not a source of insensible water loss. Instead, it could be a result of insensible water loss, but it is not a cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
