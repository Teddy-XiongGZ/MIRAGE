    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of substernal chest pain that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration, and relieved by sitting up and leaning forward, along with the ECG showing diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads, are indicative of pericarditis. Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac-like structure around the heart. This condition can cause chest pain and other symptoms similar to those seen in heart disease. The fact that the patient's chest x-ray shows normal findings further supports this diagnosis, as pericarditis would not typically cause visible changes on a chest x-ray.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
