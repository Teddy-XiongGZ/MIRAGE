    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The action potential arriving at the motor endplate triggers the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, which causes an influx of calcium ions into the presynaptic neuron's cytosol. This influx of calcium ions causes neurotransmitter-containing vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic neuron's cell membrane and release their acetylcholine quanta by exocytosis. The released acetylcholine then traverses the neuromuscular junction and binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the muscle membrane, causing depolarization and triggering an action potential that travels along the muscle fiber.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
