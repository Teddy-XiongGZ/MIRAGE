    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's endometrial biopsy shows regular tubular endometrial glands with abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma. This indicates a high rate of cell division and proliferation. The progression of cells through the cell cycle, including the phase of rapid DNA synthesis and mitosis, is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are a family of protein kinases first discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle. They are also involved in regulating transcription, mRNA processing, and the differentiation of nerve cells. They are present in all known eukaryotes, and their regulatory function in the cell cycle has been evolutionarily conserved. In fact, yeast cells can proliferate normally when their CDK gene has been replaced with the homologous human gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cyclin-dependent kinases\"}"
