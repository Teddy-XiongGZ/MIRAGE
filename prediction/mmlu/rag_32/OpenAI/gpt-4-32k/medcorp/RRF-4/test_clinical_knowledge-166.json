    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that patients often have poor knowledge about paracetamol, including its maximum recommended dose and potential side effects. Document [3] also highlights that patient knowledge of paracetamol-containing products and the maximum daily dose is insufficient to ensure safe use of the drug. Document [30] mentions that a significant number of patients ingesting a potentially toxic dose of paracetamol report purchasing the tablets in a manner contravening the legislation. This suggests that patients may not be aware of the risks of paracetamol overdose. Therefore, the statement that patients should carefully check the contents of over-the-counter cold remedies in order to prevent accidental overdose, as such preparations often contain additional paracetamol, seems to be the most relevant and important for patients to remember when taking paracetamol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
