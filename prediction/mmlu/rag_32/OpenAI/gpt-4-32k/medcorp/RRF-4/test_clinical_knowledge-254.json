    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, the position of the arm during blood pressure measurement is important. Document [20] and Document [27] suggest that elevation of the arm can have a significant effect on both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Document [30] also states that the mean blood pressures with the arm supported were consistently lower than with the arm dependent. This indicates that if the arm is above the level of the heart, the blood pressure reading will be lower than the actual blood pressure, thus it will underestimate the blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
