Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia after primary infection with chickenpox. Pain often precedes the rash by several days to a week and is typically described as burning or gnawing, and it may be mistaken for a symptom of a visceral disease such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm, myocardial infarction, cholecystitis, appendicitis, or ulcer disease. The normal findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder and the normal serum amylase concentration make the other choices less likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Herpes zoster\"}"
