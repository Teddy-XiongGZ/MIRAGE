    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of localized pain, erythema, and swelling following a minor trauma are consistent with cellulitis, a skin infection typically involving the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Streptococcus species are the most common pathogens, but Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), is an increasingly common cause. Therefore, empiric antibiotic therapy should cover both of these organisms. The patient's history of an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin rules out the use of a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic. Clindamycin, a lincosamide antibiotic, is a good choice because it covers both streptococci and staphylococci, including most strains of community-acquired MRSA. Clindamycin is also generally well tolerated, with diarrhea being the most common side effect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Clindamycin\"}"
