    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing a rapid heart rate, despite initial treatment with metoprolol. Digoxin is often used to control heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it has a slow onset of action and would not be the best choice for acute management. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension and heart failure, but it does not directly affect heart rate. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic, but it is not typically used for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is commonly used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and can be used intravenously for rapid effect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Metoprolol\"}"
