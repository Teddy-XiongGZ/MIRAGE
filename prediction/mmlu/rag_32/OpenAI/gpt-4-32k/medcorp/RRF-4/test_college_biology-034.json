    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The complementary sequence to a DNA strand is formed by pairing each base with its complement: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Additionally, the complementary sequence is written in the reverse order. So, the complement of C is G, the complement of G is C, the complement of A is T, and the complement of T is A. Therefore, the complement of the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 would be 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
