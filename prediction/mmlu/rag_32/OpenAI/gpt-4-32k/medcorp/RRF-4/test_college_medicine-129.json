    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a method that is NOT good for restricting caloric intake. Option A suggests studying at a health smoothie store instead of a coffee shop. This could potentially be a good method as it might encourage healthier food and drink choices. Option B suggests rewarding himself with a savory meal every Saturday for meeting his calorie goals. This could potentially lead to overeating and might not be a good method for restricting caloric intake. Option C suggests snapping himself with a rubber band when he eats a high calorie snack. This could potentially discourage high calorie snacking and might be a good method for restricting caloric intake. Option D suggests hiding snack food out of sight within his house. This could potentially reduce temptation and might be a good method for restricting caloric intake. Therefore, the method that seems to be NOT good for restricting caloric intake is option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
