    "First, I need to understand what the temporomandibular joint is. From Document [7], I learned that the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a diarthrosis, better defined as a ginglymoarthrodial joint. TMJ is composed of a synovial cavity, articular cartilage, and a capsule that covers the same joint. Next, I need to find information about the articular disc and articular surfaces of the TMJ. From Document [12], I learned that the TMJ is a ginglymoarthrodial joint formed by the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone and the mandibular condyle. An articular disc separates the joint into two synovial cavities with distinctive movement patterns. This suggests that the articular disc is not made of hyaline cartilage, which eliminates option A. Then, I need to find information about the covering of the articular surfaces of the TMJ. From Document [7], I learned that TMJ is composed of a synovial cavity, articular cartilage, and a capsule that covers the same joint. This suggests that the articular surfaces are covered by articular cartilage, not hyaline cartilage, which eliminates option B. Finally, I need to find information about the nerves carrying proprioceptive information from the TMJ. From Document [10], I learned that the physiological mechanisms operating through the temporomandibular joint in the perception of changes in the position of the mandible can determine extremely small discrepancies in the final occlusal position. Some observations on the pathways of neural control and reflexes are discussed and their importance in clinical situations noted. However, this document does not specify which nerves carry this information. After reviewing all the documents, I did not find specific information about the nerves carrying proprioceptive information from the TMJ. However, based on the process of elimination, I can conclude that the answer is either option C or D. In conclusion, the answer is either option C or D. However, without specific information about the nerves carrying proprioceptive information from the TMJ, I cannot definitively choose between these two options. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what the temporomandibular joint is.
