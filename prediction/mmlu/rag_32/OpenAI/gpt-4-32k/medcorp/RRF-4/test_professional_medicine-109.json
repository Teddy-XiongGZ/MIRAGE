    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient with recurrent, widespread blister formation that are most numerous in the flexural areas including the axillae and groin. The blisters do not break easily, and there are no oral lesions. This clinical presentation is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disorder. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by the presence of tense blisters that do not rupture easily, and it typically affects the flexural areas. The pathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid involves the production of autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins (BP230 and BP180), which are located at the junction of the epidermis and the dermis. These autoantibodies cause separation of the epidermis from the dermis, leading to blister formation. Therefore, the adhesion failure in this case is most likely involving the basement membrane, which is the layer that separates the epidermis from the dermis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
