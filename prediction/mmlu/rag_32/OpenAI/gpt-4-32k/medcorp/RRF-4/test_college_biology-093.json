    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From Document [0] and Document [2], we know that fungi are eukaryotic organisms, so option A is true. Document [2] also mentions that fungi have cell walls, so option B is true. Document [2] doesn't specify that most are filamentous, but it doesn't contradict it either, so we can't be sure about option C. However, Document [19] clearly states that fungal cells lack chloroplasts, which are necessary for photosynthesis. Therefore, we can conclude that fungi are not photosynthetic, making option D false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
