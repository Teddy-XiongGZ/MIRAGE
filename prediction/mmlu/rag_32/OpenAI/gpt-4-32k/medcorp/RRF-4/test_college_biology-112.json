    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optimality theory in biology, as mentioned in Document [2], is a tool used to evaluate the costs and benefits of different organismal features, traits, and characteristics. This means that a trait will persist if it provides the best return for its cost, not just if the benefits exceed the cost. Therefore, options A and C can be eliminated. Option D is also not entirely accurate because it implies that a trait must improve the relative fitness of an organism to remain in a population's gene pool, but the optimality theory is more about cost-benefit analysis than fitness improvement. Therefore, option B seems to be the most accurate representation of the optimality theory from an evolutionary perspective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
