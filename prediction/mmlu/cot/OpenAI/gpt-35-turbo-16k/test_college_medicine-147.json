    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the body needs to generate energy to fuel the muscles. Glycogen breakdown is one of the ways the body can provide this energy. Insulin is a hormone that promotes glycogen synthesis and storage, so it would not activate glycogen breakdown. Cortisol is a hormone that is released in response to stress and can promote glycogen breakdown, so it is a potential activator. Increased pH, on the other hand, would not directly activate glycogen breakdown. Therefore, the correct answer is B. cortisol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
