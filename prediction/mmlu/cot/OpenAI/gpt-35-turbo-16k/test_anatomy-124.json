    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the CNS with the cranial nerves and the sacral spinal nerves. The cranial nerves originate from the brainstem and include the oculomotor nerve (III), facial nerve (VII), glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), and vagus nerve (X). These cranial nerves carry parasympathetic fibers to various organs in the head, neck, thorax, and abdomen. The sacral spinal nerves, specifically S2-S4, also carry parasympathetic fibers and innervate the pelvic organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. sacral spinal nerves.\"}"
