    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the rate of glycolysis is high, there is an increased production of lactic acid. To limit pH changes, an intracellular buffer is needed. Glutamine is an amino acid that can act as an intracellular buffer by accepting excess protons and maintaining pH. Glucose is not an intracellular buffer and does not directly affect pH. Carnosine is a dipeptide that can act as an intracellular buffer, but it is not specifically involved in pH regulation during glycolysis. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch and is not involved in pH regulation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Glutamine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
