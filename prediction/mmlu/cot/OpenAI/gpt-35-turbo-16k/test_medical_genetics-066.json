    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Population carrier screening is a method used to identify individuals who carry a gene mutation for a specific disorder. The purpose of this screening is to provide information about the risk of having a child with the disorder. When determining which disorders are suitable for population carrier screening, several factors need to be considered, such as the prevalence of the disorder in the population, the severity of the disorder, and the availability of effective interventions or treatments. Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and Tay-Sachs disease are all suitable for population carrier screening because they are relatively common genetic disorders that can have significant health consequences. Additionally, there are interventions and treatments available for these disorders. Oculocutaneous albinism, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder that affects the pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes. While it can cause visual impairment, it is not typically associated with significant health complications. Therefore, oculocutaneous albinism is not suitable for population carrier screening.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
