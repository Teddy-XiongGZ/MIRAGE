    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi apparatus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells that is involved in the processing, packaging, and sorting of proteins and lipids. Let's evaluate each statement to determine which one is correct. \\n\\nA. It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. This statement is correct. The Golgi apparatus has two distinct faces - the cis face, which is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum, and the trans face, which is further away from the endoplasmic reticulum.\\n\\nB. It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. This statement is incorrect. The Golgi apparatus is associated with larger secretory vesicles, not small ones.\\n\\nC. Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another. This statement is correct. The Golgi apparatus is made up of a series of flattened membrane-bound sacs called cisternae, which are continuous with one another.\\n\\nD. Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen. This statement is correct. The Golgi apparatus is involved in the modification of proteins, including glycosylation, before they are transported to their final destinations.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, the correct answer is A. It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
