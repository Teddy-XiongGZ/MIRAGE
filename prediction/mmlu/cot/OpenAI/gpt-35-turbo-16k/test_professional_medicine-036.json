    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of increased glandularity in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, along with the finding of black discharge from the right nipple, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform ductography. Ductography is a procedure that involves injecting contrast dye into the ducts of the breast and then taking X-ray images to evaluate the ductal system. This can help identify any abnormalities or blockages in the ducts that may be causing the black discharge. Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue would be more appropriate if there were palpable masses or suspicious findings on imaging. Repeat mammography or ultrasonography may not provide additional information beyond what was already obtained 2 months ago.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
