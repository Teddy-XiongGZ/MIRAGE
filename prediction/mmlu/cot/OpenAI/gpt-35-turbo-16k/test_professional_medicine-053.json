    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation of chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine, along with diaphoresis, elevated blood pressure, and tachycardia, the most likely diagnosis is cocaine-induced myocardial infarction or myocardial ischemia. The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are concerning for ongoing ischemia despite initial therapy. Therefore, the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time would be a vasodilator to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve coronary blood flow. Among the options provided, the most appropriate choice would be D. Phentolamine, which is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that can help counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine and improve coronary blood flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
