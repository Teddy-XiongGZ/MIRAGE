    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Monoclonal antisera and polyclonal antisera are two types of antibodies that are used in medical research and diagnostics. To determine the difference between them, we need to consider their characteristics. A. Each type of antibody in a monoclonal antiserum reacts against a single region of a single antigen; each type of antibody in a polyclonal antiserum reacts against multiple regions of different antigens. This statement is not correct because both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies can react against multiple regions of an antigen. B. A monoclonal antibody reacts against multiple regions of a single antigen; a polyclonal antibody reacts against a single region of related antigens. This statement is also not correct because monoclonal antibodies are specific to a single region of a single antigen, while polyclonal antibodies can recognize multiple regions of related antigens. C. A monoclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of a single B lymphocyte; a polyclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of different B lymphocytes. This statement is correct. Monoclonal antibodies are produced by a single B lymphocyte clone, resulting in antibodies that are identical and specific to a single antigen. Polyclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are produced by different B lymphocytes, leading to a mixture of antibodies that can recognize different epitopes on the same antigen. D. A monoclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of a single B lymphocyte; a polyclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of both B and T lymphocytes. This statement is not correct because polyclonal antibodies are only secreted by B lymphocytes, not T lymphocytes. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. A monoclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of a single B lymphocyte; a polyclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of different B lymphocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
