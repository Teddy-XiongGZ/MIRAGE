    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's analyze each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Increasing the protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. This statement is not entirely true. While protein is essential for muscle growth and strength, there is a limit to how much protein the body can effectively utilize. Consuming excessive amounts of protein beyond what the body needs will not necessarily lead to further muscle growth or strength gains.\\n\\nB. Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power. This statement is true. Creatine is a well-researched supplement that has been shown to enhance muscle strength and power, particularly during high-intensity, short-duration activities.\\n\\nC. Amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power. This statement is not entirely true. While amino acids are the building blocks of protein and play a role in muscle growth and repair, taking amino acid supplements alone may not directly increase muscle strength and power. Adequate protein intake is generally more important for muscle strength and power.\\n\\nD. Muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions. This statement is not true. Muscle damage is typically induced by lengthening contractions, such as eccentric exercises, where the muscle is lengthening while under tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
