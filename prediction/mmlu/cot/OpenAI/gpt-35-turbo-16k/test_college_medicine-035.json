    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body, we need to consider the energy yield from each substance. The energy yield is determined by the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. Glucose has 6 carbon atoms, palmitic acid has 16 carbon atoms, leucine has 6 carbon atoms, and alcohol has 2 carbon atoms. Generally, the more carbon atoms a molecule has, the more energy it can release when oxidized. Therefore, the substance with the most carbon atoms, palmitic acid, is likely to release the most energy when completely oxidized in the body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
