    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During cell division, the mitotic spindle attaches to a specific region on the chromosome called the kinetochore. The kinetochore is a protein structure located at the centromere region of the chromosome. It serves as the attachment site for the microtubules of the mitotic spindle, which are responsible for separating the chromosomes during cell division. Therefore, the correct answer is C. kinetochore.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
