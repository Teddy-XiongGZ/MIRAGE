    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitochondria and chloroplasts are both organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are responsible for energy production through cellular respiration, while chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and B, as both plants and animals have mitochondria. Option C is also incorrect, as plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, where plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria, while animals and fungi have only mitochondria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
