    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Hamilton's rule, an altruistic trait can evolve if c < br. The altruistic behavior is costly to the donor, so c represents the fitness cost of the behavior. The benefit of the behavior is received by the recipient, so b represents the fitness benefit to the recipient. The term r represents the coefficient of relatedness between the donor and recipient. The coefficient of relatedness measures the genetic similarity between individuals, indicating the probability that they share alleles due to common ancestry. Therefore, the answer choice is A. coefficient of relatedness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
