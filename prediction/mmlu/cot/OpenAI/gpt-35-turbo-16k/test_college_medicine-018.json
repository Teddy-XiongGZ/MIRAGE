    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pKb is a measure of the strength of a base. It is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the equilibrium constant for the reaction of the base with water to produce hydroxide ions. A weak base has a small equilibrium constant, indicating that it does not dissociate significantly in water. The pOH is a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydroxide ion concentration. Since a weak base does not dissociate significantly in water, the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution will be low. Therefore, the pOH of a solution containing a weak base will be higher. Therefore, the answer is B. Higher than the pOH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
