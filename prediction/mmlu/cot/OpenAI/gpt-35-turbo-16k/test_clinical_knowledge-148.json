    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A large goitre can cause compression of nearby structures in the neck, leading to various complications. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. It causes stridor due to compression of the oesophagus: Stridor is a high-pitched sound heard during breathing and is typically associated with airway obstruction. The oesophagus is not involved in causing stridor. \\n\\nB. Dysphagia is an indication for surgery: Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing. While dysphagia can be a symptom of a large goitre, it is not an indication for surgery. The decision for surgery is based on other factors such as the size of the goitre, compression of vital structures, and presence of malignancy.\\n\\nC. It causes hoarseness due to compression of the trachea: Hoarseness is a common symptom of a large goitre. The trachea can be compressed by the goitre, leading to hoarseness.\\n\\nD. It causes a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre: The size of the goitre does not necessarily correlate with the severity of thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis refers to excessive thyroid hormone production, which can occur with both large and small goitres. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. It causes hoarseness due to compression of the trachea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
