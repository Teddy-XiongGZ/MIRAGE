    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 35-year-old man with sarcoidosis who is complaining of pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing. He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months. On examination, there are scattered bilateral basilar crackles on auscultation of the chest. The patient also has mild left hip pain with both active and passive range of motion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and neurologic examination is normal. Given these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Glucocorticoid therapy is a known risk factor for avascular necrosis, and the patient's hip pain and limited range of motion are consistent with this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
