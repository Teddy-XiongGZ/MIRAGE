    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the stereotactic brain operation, the patient experienced a sudden, intense feeling of overwhelming fear. This suggests that a specific area of the brain was stimulated. To determine which area was most likely stimulated, we can consider the functions of the given options. The amygdala is involved in processing emotions, including fear. The hippocampus is primarily associated with memory formation and retrieval. The mammillary body is part of the limbic system and is involved in memory and spatial navigation. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions, decision-making, and personality. Given that the patient experienced a sudden intense feeling of fear, it is most likely that the amygdala, which is involved in processing emotions including fear, was stimulated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
