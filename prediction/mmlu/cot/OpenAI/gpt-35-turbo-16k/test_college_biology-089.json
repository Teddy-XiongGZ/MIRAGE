    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the theory, the exposure of pollen grains to water precipitates the release of starch granules. This suggests that there is a change in the osmotic pressure within the pollen grains. Osmotic shock occurs when there is a sudden change in osmotic pressure across a cell membrane, leading to the release of cellular contents. Therefore, the correct statement would be that the interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
