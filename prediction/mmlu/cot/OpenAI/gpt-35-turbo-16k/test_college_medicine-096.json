    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Increasing the substrate concentration would have no effect on the impact of uncompetitive inhibitors because they bind to the enzyme-substrate complex and not the enzyme itself. However, increasing the substrate concentration may have an effect on the impact of noncompetitive inhibitors. Noncompetitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme, which is a different site than where the substrate binds. Therefore, increasing the substrate concentration would not directly affect the binding of noncompetitive inhibitors. The correct answer is D. No effect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
