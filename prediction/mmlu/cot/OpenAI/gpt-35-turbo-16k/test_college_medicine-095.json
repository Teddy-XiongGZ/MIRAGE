    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Triacylglycerides are composed of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone. The glycerol backbone is formed by three hydroxyl groups (OH) attached to a central carbon atom. The fatty acids are attached to the glycerol backbone through ester linkages, which are formed by the reaction between the hydroxyl group of the glycerol and the carboxyl group of the fatty acid. Therefore, the correct answer is D. II and IV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
