    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a sound wave travels from one medium to another, several properties of the wave can change. The velocity of the sound wave is determined by the properties of the medium it is traveling through, such as the density and elasticity. Therefore, the velocity of the sound wave can change when it enters a denser medium. The intensity of the sound wave, which is the amount of energy carried by the wave per unit area, can also change when it enters a denser medium. This is because some of the energy of the wave can be absorbed or reflected at the boundary between the two media. The frequency of the sound wave, which is the number of cycles of the wave that occur per unit of time, remains constant when the wave enters a denser medium. However, the wavelength of the sound wave, which is the distance between two consecutive points in the wave that are in phase, can change when the wave enters a denser medium. This is because the velocity of the wave changes, but the frequency remains constant. Therefore, the correct answer is D. wavelength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
