    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we know that when a young male bird is reared in isolation and only hears the song of a different bird species, his adult song repertoire lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This suggests that the song of his species is not entirely instinctive, as he does not naturally develop the correct song. It also suggests that the song is not dependent upon hormones for proper development, as the lack of exposure to the correct song does not affect hormone levels. Therefore, the most likely answer is that the song of his species is both instinctive and learned, as it requires exposure to the correct song during development to develop the correct characteristics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. both instinctive and learned\"}"
