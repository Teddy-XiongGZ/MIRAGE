    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exons are the coding regions of genes that are transcribed into mRNA and eventually translated into proteins. Let's evaluate each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA. This statement is incorrect because exons are specifically the coding regions of genes and do not contain noncoding DNA.\\n\\nB. The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site. This statement is generally correct. The first exon often contains the start codon (AUG) that initiates translation.\\n\\nC. The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon. This statement is generally correct. The last exon often contains the stop codon (e.g., UAA, UAG, or UGA) that signals the end of translation.\\n\\nD. A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames. This statement is correct. Each coding exon is translated in a single reading frame, which is determined by the start codon and the subsequent codons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
