    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in the alveoli. The alveoli are tiny air sacs located at the end of the bronchioles. When we breathe in, air travels through the bronchi and bronchioles and reaches the alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are very thin and surrounded by a network of capillaries. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the alveolar walls and into the capillaries, while carbon dioxide from the capillaries diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Alveoli.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
