    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Codons are sequences of nucleotide bases that code for specific amino acids. They are found in mRNA or DNA. The question is asking about the composition of codons, so we need to determine the correct option that describes the structure of codons. A. triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA: This option correctly describes the composition of codons. Codons are indeed composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA. B. quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA: This option is incorrect because codons consist of three nucleotide bases, not four. C. triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains: This option is incorrect because codons code for amino acids, but they are not composed of amino acids themselves. D. triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA: This option is incorrect because codons are sequences of nucleotide bases, not deoxyribose sugars. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is A. triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
