    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle. To answer this, we need to understand the components of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle is made up of muscle fibers, which contain smaller units called myofibrils. Myofibrils are composed of repeating units called sarcomeres. Within the sarcomeres, there are two main types of contractile proteins: actin and myosin. Actin is a thin filament protein, while myosin is a thick filament protein. Therefore, the correct answer is B. actin and myosin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
