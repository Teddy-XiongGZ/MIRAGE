    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a peripheral motor nerve is cut and does not regenerate, the muscles it innervates will eventually show signs of denervation. Denervation refers to the loss of nerve supply to a muscle. The specific signs that occur depend on the type of muscle fibers affected. In this case, since the nerve is responsible for innervating the muscles, the muscles will eventually undergo atrophy. Atrophy refers to the wasting or shrinking of muscle tissue due to lack of use or stimulation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. atrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
