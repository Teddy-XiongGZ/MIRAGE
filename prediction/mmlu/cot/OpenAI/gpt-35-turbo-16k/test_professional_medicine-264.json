    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The increased maternal serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration suggests a possible neural tube defect or abdominal wall defect in the fetus. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform ultrasonography to evaluate the fetal anatomy and confirm the presence of any structural abnormalities. Ultrasonography can provide detailed information about the fetus and help identify any potential anomalies. Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration alone would not provide additional information about the fetal anatomy. Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations is typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation to assess the risk of Down syndrome, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. Amniocentesis for measurement of \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration is an invasive procedure and is typically reserved for cases where there is a high risk of a specific genetic or chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome or neural tube defects. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is ultrasonography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
