    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fetal hemoglobin is a type of hemoglobin that is present in the fetus and is gradually replaced by adult hemoglobin after birth. The main difference between fetal and adult hemoglobin is their affinity for oxygen. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin. If an individual retains a form of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood, it would mean that their hemoglobin would have a higher affinity for oxygen than normal adult hemoglobin. This would result in increased oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
