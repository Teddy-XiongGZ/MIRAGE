    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis is the enzyme that controls the overall rate of the glycolytic pathway. To determine the rate limiting enzyme, we need to identify the enzyme that catalyzes the slowest or most regulated step in the pathway. In glycolysis, the enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This step is highly regulated and determines the flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway. Therefore, the rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis is D. phosphofructokinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
