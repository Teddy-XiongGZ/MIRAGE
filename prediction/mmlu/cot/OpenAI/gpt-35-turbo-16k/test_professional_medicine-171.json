    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The absence of a urethral opening in a male stillborn is suggestive of a condition called hypospadias, which is a congenital anomaly where the opening of the urethra is located on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip. Hypospadias is often associated with other congenital anomalies. Among the given options, the most likely additional finding in this stillborn is C. Pulmonary hypoplasia. Pulmonary hypoplasia is a condition where the lungs are underdeveloped, and it can occur in cases of oligohydramnios, which is a condition characterized by a decreased amount of amniotic fluid.

Situs inversus, are not typically associated with hypospadias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
