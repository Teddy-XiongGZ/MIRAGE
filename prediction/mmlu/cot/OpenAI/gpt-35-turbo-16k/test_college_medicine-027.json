    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The acceleration of the object can be determined by analyzing the forces acting on it. The force of gravity acting on the object can be broken down into two components: one parallel to the incline (mg sin ?) and one perpendicular to the incline (mg cos ?). The frictional force opposing the motion of the object can be calculated as \u00b5N, where N is the normal force. The normal force can be determined as mg cos ?. Since the object is on a plane, the normal force is equal to the perpendicular component of the force of gravity. Therefore, N = mg cos ?. The net force acting on the object parallel to the incline is given by the difference between the force of gravity component parallel to the incline and the frictional force. Therefore, the acceleration of the object is given by a = (mg sin ? - \u00b5N)/m = g sin ? - \u00b5g cos ? = g (sin ? - \u00b5 cos ?). Hence, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
