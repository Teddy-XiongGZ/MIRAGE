    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron in the kidney is known as the glomerulus. The glomerulus is responsible for filtering waste products and excess fluid from the blood to form urine. The afferent arteriole is the blood vessel that brings blood into the glomerulus, but it is not the cluster of blood capillaries itself. The loop of Henle is a part of the nephron that plays a role in reabsorbing water and electrolytes. The renal pelvis is the funnel-shaped structure that collects urine from the nephrons and transports it to the ureter. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Glomerulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
