    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of cholesterol in the blood. It is caused by mutations in a specific gene. To determine the gene responsible, we need to consider the role of different molecules involved in cholesterol metabolism. High density lipoprotein (HDL) is often referred to as 'good cholesterol' as it helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream. HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is often referred to as 'bad cholesterol' as it carries cholesterol to the cells. The LDL receptor is responsible for the uptake of LDL from the bloodstream into the cells. Considering that familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterized by high levels of cholesterol, it is most likely caused by mutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
