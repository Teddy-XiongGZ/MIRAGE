    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exon skipping refers to the process where one or more exons are excluded from the final mRNA transcript during RNA processing. This can result in the production of a truncated or non-functional protein. Exon skipping is typically associated with mutations that affect the splicing process, such as mutations in splice sites or splicing regulatory elements. These mutations can disrupt the normal splicing machinery and lead to the exclusion of specific exons. Therefore, the correct answer is C. RNA processing mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
