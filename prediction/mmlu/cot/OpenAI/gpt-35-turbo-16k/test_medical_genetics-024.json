    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Down syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Therefore, the karyotype that is diagnostic of Down syndrome should show an abnormality involving chromosome 21. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. 46,XX,der(14;21)(q10;q10)pat+21: This karyotype shows a derivative chromosome involving chromosomes 14 and 21, but it does not show an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is not diagnostic of Down syndrome.\\n\\nB. 47,XY,+13: This karyotype shows an extra copy of chromosome 13, not chromosome 21. This is not diagnostic of Down syndrome.\\n\\nC. 45,XX,rob,(14;21)(q10;q10): This karyotype shows a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosomes 14 and 21, but it does not show an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is not diagnostic of Down syndrome.\\n\\nD. 46,XY,t(2;3)(q21;q12): This karyotype shows a translocation involving chromosomes 2 and 3, but it does not involve chromosome 21. This is not diagnostic of Down syndrome.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is option A. 46,XX,der(14;21)(q10;q10)pat+21.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
