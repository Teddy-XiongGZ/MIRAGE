    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The human genome is composed of DNA sequences that contain genes, which are responsible for encoding proteins. However, not all of the human genome is made up of genes. The majority of the genome consists of non-coding regions. To determine the approximate fraction of the human genome that encodes proteins, we need to consider the proportion of coding regions compared to the entire genome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 50%\"}"
