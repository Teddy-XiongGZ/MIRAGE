    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Complete bilateral cleft palate refers to a cleft that affects both sides of the palate. To determine the cause of this condition, we need to understand the normal fusion of facial processes during development. The palatine processes are responsible for the formation of the hard palate, while the frontonasal processes contribute to the formation of the upper lip and primary palate. The secondary nasal processes contribute to the formation of the nasal septum and the secondary palate. The mandibular processes are involved in the development of the lower jaw. In the case of complete bilateral cleft palate, all of these processes fail to fuse properly. Therefore, the correct answer is D. palatine, frontonasal, secondary nasal processes, and mandibular processes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
