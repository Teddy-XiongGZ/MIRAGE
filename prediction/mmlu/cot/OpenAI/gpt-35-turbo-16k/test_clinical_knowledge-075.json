    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When stretching, it is important to hold the stretch for a certain amount of time to allow the muscles to lengthen and relax. Holding a stretch for too short of a time may not provide enough benefit, while holding it for too long may lead to overstretching and potential injury. The minimum time a stretch should be held for is typically around 10-30 seconds. This allows enough time for the muscles to respond to the stretch and for the connective tissues to adapt. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 10-30 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
