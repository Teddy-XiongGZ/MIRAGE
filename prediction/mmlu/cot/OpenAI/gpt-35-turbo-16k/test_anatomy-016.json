    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During quiet inspiration, the primary muscle responsible for breathing is the diaphragm. The diaphragm contracts and moves downward, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity and causing air to be drawn into the lungs. The external intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, also play a role in quiet inspiration by lifting the ribcage and expanding the chest. The internal intercostal muscles, on the other hand, are primarily active during forced expiration. Therefore, the correct answer is B. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
