    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. It is produced in the ventricles of the brain and circulates around the brain and spinal cord. To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the layers of the meninges, which are the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord. The meninges consist of three layers: the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The dura mater is the outermost layer, followed by the arachnoid mater, and then the pia mater, which is the innermost layer. CSF circulates in the subarachnoid space, which is the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. Therefore, the correct answer is B. CSF circulates between the dura mater and arachnoid mater.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
