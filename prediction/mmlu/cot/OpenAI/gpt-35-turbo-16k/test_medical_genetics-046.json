    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The phenomenon described in the question is the ability of one genotype to produce different physiological or morphological states in response to different environmental conditions during development. This is known as developmental plasticity. Fetal plasticity refers specifically to the ability of the fetus to adapt to changes in the intrauterine environment. The fetal origins hypothesis suggests that early life experiences can have long-term effects on health and disease risk. Environmental plasticity refers to the ability of an organism to adapt to changes in its external environment. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
