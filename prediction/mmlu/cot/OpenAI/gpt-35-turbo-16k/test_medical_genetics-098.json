    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the development of an egg, differential distribution of substances can result in various outcomes. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. differences in gene expression which may establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide: This option suggests that the differential distribution of substances can lead to differences in gene expression, which in turn can establish a pattern in the developing embryo. This is a plausible outcome of differential substance distribution.\\n\\nB. amplification of specific genes during development: This option suggests that specific genes can be amplified during development as a result of differential substance distribution. While gene amplification can occur during development, it is not directly related to the differential distribution of substances in the egg.\\n\\nC. development of polyploid tissues: This option suggests that the differential distribution of substances can lead to the development of polyploid tissues. Polyploidy refers to having multiple sets of chromosomes, and it is not directly related to the differential distribution of substances in the egg.\\n\\nD. loss of specific genes during development: This option suggests that specific genes can be lost during development as a result of differential substance distribution. While gene loss can occur during development, it is not directly related to the differential distribution of substances in the egg.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, option A seems to be the most likely outcome of the differential distribution of substances in the egg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
