    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Batesian mimicry is a form of mimicry in which a harmless species evolves to imitate the warning signals of a harmful or toxic species. The purpose of Batesian mimicry is to deceive predators into thinking that the mimic is dangerous, thus avoiding predation. Option A describes a situation where a millipede is toxic to a toad, and the toad learns to avoid it after an initial attempt to consume it. This is an example of learned avoidance, not Batesian mimicry. Option B describes a moth that exhibits false eyes at its tail end to disorient predators. This is an example of a defensive adaptation, but it is not Batesian mimicry. Option C describes a moth that exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee. This is an example of Batesian mimicry because the harmless moth is imitating the warning signals of the harmful bee to deceive predators. Option D describes a ground-nesting gull chick that displays a coloration pattern that is nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings. This is an example of camouflage, not Batesian mimicry. Therefore, the correct answer is C. A moth exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
