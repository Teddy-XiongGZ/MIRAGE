    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When we exhale, we are expelling waste products from our body. One of the main waste products that is expelled during exhalation is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is produced as a byproduct of cellular respiration in our body. Oxygen is taken in during inhalation and is used by our cells for various metabolic processes. Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, but it is not produced or consumed by our body. Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that is produced from the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing substances, such as tobacco smoke or car exhaust. Therefore, the substance found in greater quantity in exhaled air is carbon dioxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
