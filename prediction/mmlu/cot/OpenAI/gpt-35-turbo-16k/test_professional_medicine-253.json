The peripheral blood smear shows mature-appearing lymphocytes of B-cell origin. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a common leukemia in older adults and is characterized by the accumulation of mature-appearing lymphocytes in the blood. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) typically presents with a higher leukocyte count and immature lymphocytes.
