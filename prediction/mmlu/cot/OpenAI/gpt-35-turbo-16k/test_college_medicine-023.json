    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Passive transport is the process that uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane. In passive transport, molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, down their concentration gradient, without the need for energy input. Osmosis is a specific type of passive transport that involves the movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane. Active transport, on the other hand, requires the input of energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient. Endocytosis is a process by which cells take in large molecules or particles by engulfing them with the cell membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Passive Transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
