    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A dental panoramic radiograph is a type of dental X-ray that captures the entire mouth in a single image. It is used to evaluate the teeth, jawbone, and surrounding structures. When interpreting a dental panoramic radiograph, it is important to know which structures should be visible. Step 1: The mandibular canal is a structure that houses the inferior alveolar nerve and blood vessels. It runs through the mandible (lower jaw) and is responsible for providing sensation to the lower teeth and chin. The mandibular canal should be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph. Step 2: The maxillary sinus is a cavity located in the maxilla (upper jaw) above the posterior teeth. It should also be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph. Step 3: The hard palate is the bony structure that forms the roof of the mouth. It should be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph. Step 4: The zygomatic arch is a bony structure that forms the prominence of the cheek. It is not typically visible on a dental panoramic radiograph. Based on the above steps, the correct answer is C. The mandibular canal, maxillary sinus, and hard palate should be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
