    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a class of drugs that are designed to selectively bind to androgen receptors in the body. Androgen receptors are proteins found in cells that are responsible for mediating the effects of androgen hormones, such as testosterone. SARMs are specifically designed to target androgen receptors in muscle and bone tissue, with the goal of promoting muscle growth and increasing bone density. Given this information, we can eliminate options C and D, as they both suggest that SARMs are non-steroid drugs. However, SARMs are actually a type of steroid drug. Now, we need to determine whether SARMs act on androgen receptors by mimicking or antagonizing the effects of natural steroid hormones. Mimicking would mean that SARMs produce similar effects to natural steroid hormones, while antagonizing would mean that SARMs block or inhibit the effects of natural steroid hormones. Based on their mechanism of action, SARMs are designed to mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones. They bind to androgen receptors and activate them, leading to increased protein synthesis and muscle growth. Therefore, the correct answer is A: steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
