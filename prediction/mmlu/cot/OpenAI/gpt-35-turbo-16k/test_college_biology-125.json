    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bees are attracted to flowers with ultraviolet color patterns on the petals, so this adaptation would not limit pollination by bees. Modified petals to provide a landing space would actually facilitate bee pollination. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers are more likely to attract hummingbirds, as they are attracted to the color red. Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts would also attract hummingbirds, as they have a high metabolic rate and require a lot of energy. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
