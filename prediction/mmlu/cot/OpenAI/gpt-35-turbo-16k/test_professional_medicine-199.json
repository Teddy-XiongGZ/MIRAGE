    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of long-standing tremor that has worsened over the past month. The tremor is now more noticeable and frequent, to the point where she is embarrassed to eat with others. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks, but it is unlikely to be the cause of her worsening tremor as it has been present for most of her life. Bereavement reaction is also unlikely to be the cause, as the tremor has been present for a long time and has only recently worsened. Early Parkinson disease is a possibility, but other causes should be considered first. The patient's increase in alcohol consumption from one to two drinks monthly to one glass of wine daily is the most likely cause of her worsening tremor.
