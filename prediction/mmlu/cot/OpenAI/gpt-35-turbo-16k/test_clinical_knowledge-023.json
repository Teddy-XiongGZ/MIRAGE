    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is true about informal carers as of 2020, we need to evaluate each statement one by one. A. 50% of over 65s are providing informal care: This statement suggests that half of the population over the age of 65 is providing informal care. To determine its accuracy, we would need to look at reliable data or research studies on the prevalence of informal care among this age group. B. One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care: This statement suggests that approximately 1 in 6 individuals over the age of 65 is providing informal care. Again, we would need to refer to data or research studies to verify this statement. C. Informal carers should not be included in discharge planning: This statement suggests that informal carers should not be involved in the planning process when a patient is being discharged from a healthcare facility. However, it is generally recognized that involving informal carers in discharge planning can be beneficial for the patient's well-being and continuity of care. D. The majority of informal carers are fit and active: This statement implies that most informal carers are in good physical health and able to provide care. To determine its accuracy, we would need to refer to data or research studies on the health status of informal carers. Based on the step-by-step evaluation, we can conclude that we do not have enough information to determine which statement is true about informal carers as of 2020. Further research and data analysis would be required.\", \"answer_choice\": \"E. Not enough information to determine\"}"
