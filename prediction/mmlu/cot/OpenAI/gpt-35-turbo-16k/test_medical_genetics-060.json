    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, indicates a higher level of inbreeding within a population. Inbreeding refers to the mating of individuals who are closely related, such as siblings or cousins. When individuals who are closely related mate, there is a higher chance of inheriting identical copies of genes from both parents. This leads to a reduction in genetic diversity within the population. A. reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population: Inbreeding increases the likelihood of homozygosity, meaning that individuals are more likely to have two identical copies of a gene. This reduces the likelihood of heterozygotes, which are individuals with two different copies of a gene. B. higher proportion of genes that show linkage: Inbreeding can increase the proportion of genes that show linkage, which means that they are inherited together more frequently than expected by chance. This is because inbreeding increases the chance of inheriting identical copies of genes from both parents, including genes that are physically close to each other on the same chromosome. C. higher proportion of genes with introns: The presence of introns in genes is not directly related to inbreeding. Inbreeding affects the frequency of different alleles (versions of a gene) within a population, but it does not directly influence the presence or absence of introns in genes. D. higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells: Inbreeding does not directly affect the level of difference between RNA molecules in daughter cells. The level of difference between RNA molecules is influenced by processes such as transcription and post-transcriptional modifications, which are not directly related to inbreeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
