    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The gray crescent in an amphibian zygote is an important developmental marker. It indicates the future dorsal side of the embryo and is responsible for organizing the development of the body plan. If the gray crescent is contained in only one of the two blastomeres resulting from the first cleavage and the blastomeres are then separated, the expected fate of the blastomeres would be as follows: The blastomere with the gray crescent will have the necessary developmental information to form a complete, but small, embryo. On the other hand, the blastomere without the gray crescent will lack the necessary developmental information and will not be able to form a complete embryo. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
