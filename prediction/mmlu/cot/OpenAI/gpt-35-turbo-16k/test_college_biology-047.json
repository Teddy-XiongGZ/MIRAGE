    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The correct anatomical order of structures in the mammalian female reproductive tract is as follows: The oviduct (also known as the fallopian tube) is the first structure. It is responsible for capturing the egg released from the ovary and transporting it to the uterus. The uterus is the next structure in line, where the fertilized egg implants and develops into a fetus. The vagina is the third structure, which serves as the birth canal and also connects the uterus to the external environment. Finally, the rete is not a part of the female reproductive tract, so it is not included in the correct order.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
