    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sickle-cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells. The mutation in sickle-cell disease is a point mutation, which means that there is a change in a single nucleotide base pair in the DNA sequence. This point mutation results in the substitution of one amino acid (glutamic acid) with another (valine) in the hemoglobin protein, leading to the characteristic sickle shape of the red blood cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
