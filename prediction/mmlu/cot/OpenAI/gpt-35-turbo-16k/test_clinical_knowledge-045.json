    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Success in sport is determined by a combination of factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. A high energy diet and large appetite: While nutrition is important for performance, it is not the sole determinant of success in sport.\\n\\nB. High intelligence and motivation to succeed: While intelligence and motivation can contribute to success in various aspects of life, they are not the main factors determining success in sport.\\n\\nC. A good coach and the motivation to succeed: Having a good coach and being motivated are important factors in achieving success in sport, but they are not the only factors.\\n\\nD. Innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus: This option seems to be the most accurate. Innate ability refers to natural talent or genetic predisposition, while the capacity to respond to the training stimulus refers to how well an individual's body adapts and improves with training. These factors play a significant role in determining success in sport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
