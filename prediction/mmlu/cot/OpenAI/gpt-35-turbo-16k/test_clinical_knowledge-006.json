    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diplopia refers to double vision, where a person sees two images of a single object. Let's evaluate each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered: This statement is false. Diplopia can still occur even if one eye is covered, as it is caused by a misalignment of the eyes or a problem with the visual system.\\n\\nB. The outer image is always the false image: This statement is false. In diplopia, one image is typically perceived as false, but it can be either the inner or outer image depending on the underlying cause.\\n\\nC. A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards: This statement is true. Fourth nerve palsy, also known as trochlear nerve palsy, typically causes vertical diplopia that worsens when the affected eye looks downward and inward.\\n\\nD. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint: This statement is true. Sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, can cause a divergent squint or strabismus, where the affected eye deviates outward.\\n\\nConsidering the explanations above, the correct answer is C. A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
