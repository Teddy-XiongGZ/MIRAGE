Trigeminal neuralgia is a neuropathic pain disorder characterized by severe, brief, electric shock-like pain in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. It is often triggered by innocuous stimuli. The first-line pharmacotherapy for trigeminal neuralgia is carbamazepine, an antiepileptic drug that acts by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate are also antiepileptic drugs, but they are not the first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
