    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of producing different proteins from the same gene is known as alternative splicing. Here is the step-by-step explanation:\\n\\n1. Initially, a gene is transcribed into a primary transcript called pre-mRNA.\\n2. The pre-mRNA contains both coding regions called exons and non-coding regions called introns.\\n3. Alternative RNA splicing occurs during the processing of pre-mRNA.\\n4. During alternative splicing, different combinations of exons can be included or excluded from the final mRNA molecule.\\n5. This results in the production of multiple mRNA molecules with different combinations of exons.\\n6. Each mRNA molecule is then translated into a protein, leading to the production of several different proteins from the same gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
