    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman has a single gene deletion, which means she is a carrier for \u03b1-thalassemia. The man has a two-gene deletion, which means he has \u03b1-thalassemia. If the two-gene deletion is in trans, it means one deletion is on the maternal gene and one deletion is on the paternal gene. Since the woman is a carrier, there is a 50% chance that she will pass on the single gene deletion to each of her offspring. If the man passes on the two-gene deletion, and the woman passes on the single gene deletion, their offspring will have a two-gene deletion, resulting in \u03b1-thalassemia. Therefore, the answer is C. 50%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
