    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prosthetic groups are non-protein molecules that are tightly bound to enzymes and are required for their activity. They are not required by all enzymes in the cell, so option A is incorrect. Prosthetic groups are not loosely bound to enzymes via hydrogen bonds, so option B is also incorrect. Prosthetic groups are not sites on the enzyme molecule that permit allosteric modification of enzyme activity, so option C is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, which states that prosthetic groups are tightly bound to enzymes and are required for their activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
