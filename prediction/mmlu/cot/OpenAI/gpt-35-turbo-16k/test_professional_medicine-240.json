    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's clinical presentation includes a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis, as well as thick nasal secretions and salty sweat. These findings are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The genetic testing detected a mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that two copies of the mutated CFTR gene are typically required for the disease to manifest. However, there are certain CFTR mutations, such as G551D, that can cause disease even when present in only one allele. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's clinical phenotype is that only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
