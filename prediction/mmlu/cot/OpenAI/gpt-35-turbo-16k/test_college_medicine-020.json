    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Steroid-based molecules are derived from cholesterol and have a specific structure consisting of four fused rings. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nI. Testosterone: Testosterone is a steroid hormone and is derived from cholesterol. It has the characteristic structure of a steroid molecule.\\n\\nII. Triglycerides: Triglycerides are not steroid-based molecules. They are a type of fat composed of glycerol and three fatty acids.\\n\\nIII. Progesterone: Progesterone is also a steroid hormone and is derived from cholesterol. It has the characteristic structure of a steroid molecule.\\n\\nIV. DNA: DNA is not a steroid-based molecule. It is a nucleic acid composed of nucleotides.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. I and III, as both testosterone and progesterone are steroid-based molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
