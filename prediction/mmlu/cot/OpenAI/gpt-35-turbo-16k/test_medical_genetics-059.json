    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Humans have a diploid number of chromosomes, which means they have two sets of chromosomes. To determine the number of chromosomes in each cell, we need to divide the total number of chromosomes by the number of sets. The total number of chromosomes in humans is 46. Therefore, each cell normally contains 46 divided by 2, which is 23 pairs of chromosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 23 pairs\"}"
