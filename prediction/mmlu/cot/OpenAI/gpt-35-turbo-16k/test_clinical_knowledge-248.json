    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The transcription of DNA to messenger RNA occurs in the nucleus. This is because the DNA is located in the nucleus of the cell, and the process of transcription involves the synthesis of RNA molecules from a DNA template. The RNA polymerase enzyme binds to the DNA and synthesizes a complementary RNA strand, which is then processed and transported out of the nucleus into the cytosol for further processing and translation on the ribosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
