    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, the initial energy source is likely to come from the readily available stores of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in the muscle cells. ATP is the primary energy currency of the body and is used for immediate energy needs. Glycolysis, creatine phosphorylation, and phosphocreatine stores are also involved in energy production, but they are more relevant for sustained or prolonged muscle contractions rather than short bursts of high force contractions. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is D. ATP stores.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
