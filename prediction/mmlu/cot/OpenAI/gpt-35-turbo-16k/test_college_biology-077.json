    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options one by one:\\n\\nA. Thigmotropism is the growth or movement of a plant in response to touch or contact with a solid object. This does not involve a trellis.\\n\\nB. Phototropism is the growth or movement of a plant in response to light. While a trellis may provide support for the plant to grow towards the light, it is not the primary factor in this case.\\n\\nC. Gravidotropism is the growth or movement of a plant in response to gravity. This does not apply to a plant growing along a trellis.\\n\\nD. Negative gravidotropism is the growth or movement of a plant away from gravity. This also does not apply to a plant growing along a trellis.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. phototropism, as the plant is growing towards the light source.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
