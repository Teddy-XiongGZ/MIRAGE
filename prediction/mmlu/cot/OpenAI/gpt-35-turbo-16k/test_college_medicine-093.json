    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given excerpt discusses the health benefits of sauna use and the physiological responses to heat exposure. It mentions the findings from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, which showed reduced death and disease in frequent sauna users. It also mentions the reduced risk of developing dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and psychotic disorders associated with sauna use. The excerpt further explains the physiological responses to heat exposure, such as increased cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow. Based on this information, it is unlikely that the next paragraph would discuss a protein that facilitates intracellular function in response to heat, increased heart attacks in Eskimo populations, or Finland's water polo team excellence. A study on rats exposed to high levels of heat may be relevant to the topic of heat exposure and physiological responses, so it is a likely paragraph that follows the excerpt.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
