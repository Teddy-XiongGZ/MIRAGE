    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FGFR3 is a gene that encodes for a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Mutations in this gene can lead to various skeletal dysplasias and craniosynostosis syndromes. To determine which condition is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3, we need to identify the conditions that are not associated with this gene. A. Achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature and disproportionately short limbs. It is caused by a specific mutation in the FGFR3 gene, so it is associated with FGFR3. B. Crouzon syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by premature fusion of the skull bones. It is caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene, not FGFR3. C. Thanatophoric dysplasia is a severe skeletal dysplasia characterized by extremely short limbs and a narrow chest. It is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene, so it is associated with FGFR3. D. Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hearing loss, changes in pigmentation, and other developmental abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in various genes, including the PAX3 gene, not FGFR3. Based on this information, the condition that is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3 is B. Crouzon syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
