    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient underwent a hysterectomy 6 months ago and now presents with chronic pelvic pain. A CT scan reveals a surgical sponge in her pelvis. The fact that a surgical sponge was left in the patient's pelvis after the hysterectomy suggests negligence. The legal concept that represents this situation is res ipsa loquitur, which means 'the thing speaks for itself'. Res ipsa loquitur is invoked when an injury occurs under circumstances that would not normally occur in the absence of negligence. In this case, the presence of a surgical sponge in the patient's pelvis after surgery is evidence of negligence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. res ipsa loquitur\"}"
