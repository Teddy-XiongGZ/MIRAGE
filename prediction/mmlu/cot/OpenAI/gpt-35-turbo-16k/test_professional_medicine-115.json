    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 20-year-old female with a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting. She also noticed a slight amount of blood in her vomit. Given her age and symptoms, the most likely cause of her symptoms is stress-induced gastritis or a peptic ulcer. The initial test to order should help confirm this diagnosis. Abdominal flat plate radiography is not necessary as it does not provide information specific to the patient's symptoms. Amylase level is not indicated as the patient does not have symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis. Urine pregnancy test is not necessary as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with pregnancy. A complete blood count (CBC) can help identify any signs of infection or anemia, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate initial test to order in this case is a complete blood count (CBC).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
