    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ectomesenchyme is a type of embryonic connective tissue that gives rise to various structures in the body. To determine which of the given structures is derived from ectomesenchyme, we need to understand the origin of each option. \\n\\nA. Motor neurons: Motor neurons are derived from the neural tube, not ectomesenchyme. \\nB. Skeletal muscles: Skeletal muscles are derived from mesoderm, not ectomesenchyme. \\nC. Melanocytes: Melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells, which are a type of ectomesenchyme. \\nD. Sweat glands: Sweat glands are derived from the epidermis, which is derived from ectoderm, not ectomesenchyme. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is C.
