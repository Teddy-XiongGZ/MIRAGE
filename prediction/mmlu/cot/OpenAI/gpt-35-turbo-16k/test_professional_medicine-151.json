    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with nonradiating low back pain that started after working in his yard. He has no change in bowel movements or urination, and the pain is associated with bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm and limited range of motion. These findings are consistent with acute low back strain, which is a common cause of acute low back pain. The straight-leg raising test is negative, ruling out nerve root compression. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, indicating that there are no signs of serious underlying pathology. The most appropriate next step in management for acute low back strain is to encourage regular activity. Bed rest is no longer recommended as it can lead to deconditioning and delayed recovery. X-rays and MRI are not indicated in the absence of red flags or neurological deficits. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Regular activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
