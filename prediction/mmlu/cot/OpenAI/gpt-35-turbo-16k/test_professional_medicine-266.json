    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with sudden onset pain, swelling, warmth, erythema, and effusion in her right knee. These findings are consistent with acute monoarthritis. The presence of clear synovial fluid with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy suggests the deposition of crystals. The most likely cause of these findings is calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), also known as pseudogout. CPPD is characterized by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to acute inflammatory arthritis. The other options, including ammonium urate, calcium oxalate, and calcium urate, are not associated with the specific findings described in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Calcium pyrophosphate\"}"
