    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history and examination findings, the patient likely has a pelvic fracture with associated urethral injury. The presence of blood at the urethral meatus suggests a urethral disruption. Retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate the extent of the urethral injury. The portion of the urethra at greatest risk for injury in this patient is the membranous urethra. The membranous urethra is the shortest and least mobile part of the male urethra, making it more susceptible to injury in cases of pelvic trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
