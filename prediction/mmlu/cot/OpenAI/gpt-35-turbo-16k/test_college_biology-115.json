    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A competitive inhibitor of an enzyme exerts its effect by competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site. This means that the inhibitor and the substrate cannot bind to the enzyme simultaneously. The inhibitor binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming a non-covalent complex. This binding prevents the substrate from binding to the enzyme's active site, reducing the enzyme's activity. The inhibitor does not irreversibly modify the enzyme or form covalent links with it, and it does not decrease the number of enzyme molecules available for substrate binding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
