    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. They are linked together through covalent bonds called peptide bonds. Peptide bonds form between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid. Hydrogen bonds are not involved in linking amino acids in a protein. Ionic bonds are not typically involved in the primary structure of proteins. Glycosidic bonds are involved in linking monosaccharides to form carbohydrates, not amino acids in proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
