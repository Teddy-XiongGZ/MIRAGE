    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In E. coli, the lac operon is responsible for the metabolism of lactose. The lac operon consists of three genes: lacZ, lacY, and lacA. The lac operon is regulated by a repressor protein that binds to the operator region of the operon in the absence of lactose. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor and prevents it from binding to the operator, allowing the genes to be transcribed and expressed. If there is a mutation in the repressor that prevents it from binding to lactose, it would mean that the repressor is unable to bind to the operator even in the presence of lactose. This would result in the constitutive expression of the lac operon genes, regardless of the level of glucose. Therefore, the correct answer is A. constitutive expression of the lac operon genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
