    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chemosynthetic bacteria are able to produce their own food without the need for sunlight or photon-absorbing pigments. This means that they must obtain energy from another source. Chemosynthetic bacteria derive energy by either oxidizing inorganic substances or oxidizing organic compounds. Option A states that they oxidize inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen. Option B states that they reduce inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen. Option C states that they oxidize organic compounds. Option D states that they transduce light energy into chemical energy. Since chemosynthetic bacteria do not rely on light energy, option D can be eliminated. Chemosynthetic bacteria obtain energy by oxidizing inorganic substances, so the correct answer is option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
