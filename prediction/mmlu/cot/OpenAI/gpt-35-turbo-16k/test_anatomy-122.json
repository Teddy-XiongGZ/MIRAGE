    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Patients with pernicious anemia are treated with injections of vitamin B-12. Pernicious anemia is a condition where the body is unable to absorb enough vitamin B-12 from the diet. This can lead to a deficiency of vitamin B-12, which is necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells. Injections of vitamin B-12 bypass the absorption problem and provide the necessary vitamin directly to the body. Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face, and it is not treated with vitamin B-12 injections. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and while it can cause malabsorption of nutrients, it is not specifically treated with vitamin B-12 injections. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland, and it is also not treated with vitamin B-12 injections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
