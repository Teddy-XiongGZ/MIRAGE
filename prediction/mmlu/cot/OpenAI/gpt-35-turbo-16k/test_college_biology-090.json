    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the chromosome number of a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously, it results in a polyploid plant. Polyploidy can have different effects on the descendants of the plant. In this case, the descendants of the plants with the double chromosome number would likely have the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally. This is because polyploidy can lead to the formation of bivalents during meiosis, allowing for normal chromosome pairing and segregation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
