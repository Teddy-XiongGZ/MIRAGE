    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During swallowing, several events occur to ensure that food or liquid is directed into the esophagus and not the airway. Let's go through each option:\\n\\nA. The auditory tube, also known as the Eustachian tube, is responsible for equalizing pressure between the middle ear and the nasopharynx. It does not directly play a role in swallowing.\\n\\nB. The cricopharyngeus muscle is part of the upper esophageal sphincter and contracts to prevent food or liquid from entering the larynx and trachea during swallowing.\\n\\nC. The rima glottis refers to the opening between the vocal cords in the larynx. During swallowing, the rima glottis closes to prevent food or liquid from entering the airway.\\n\\nD. The gag reflex is a protective reflex that is triggered by stimulation of the back of the throat. It causes the muscles in the throat to contract and can help prevent choking.\\n\\nBased on these explanations, the correct answer is B. cricopharyngeus muscle contracts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
