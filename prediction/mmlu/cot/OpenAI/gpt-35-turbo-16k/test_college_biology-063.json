    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how many membrane bilayers the protein must cross to reach its final location, we need to understand the structure of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have an outer membrane and an inner membrane, with the thylakoid membrane located inside the chloroplast. The thylakoid membrane forms stacks called grana, and the lumen of the thylakoid is the space inside these stacks. Based on the information provided, the protein is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, which means it starts in the cytoplasm. To reach the lumen of the thylakoid, the protein must cross the outer membrane of the chloroplast, the intermembrane space between the outer and inner membranes, and the inner membrane of the chloroplast. Therefore, the protein must cross a total of three membrane bilayers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
