    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Bernoulli's principle, the pressure in a fluid decreases as its velocity increases. In the circulatory system, blood flows from larger arteries to smaller capillaries, resulting in an increase in velocity. Therefore, if the cross-sectional area of the capillary in the neck is equal to the cross-sectional area of the capillary in the knee, the velocity of blood flow in the neck capillary would be greater than in the knee capillary. As a result, the pressure in the neck capillary would be lower than the pressure in the knee capillary. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The pressure in the knee is greater than the pressure in the neck because of the increase in pressure head.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
