    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the rate of glycolysis is high, there is an increased production of lactic acid. To limit pH changes, an intracellular buffer is needed. Glutamine is an amino acid that can act as an intracellular buffer by accepting excess protons and preventing a decrease in pH. Glucose is not an intracellular buffer and does not directly affect pH. Carnosine is a dipeptide that can act as an intracellular buffer, but it is primarily found in muscle tissue and may not be as effective in other cell types. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch and does not have a role in buffering pH. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Glutamine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
