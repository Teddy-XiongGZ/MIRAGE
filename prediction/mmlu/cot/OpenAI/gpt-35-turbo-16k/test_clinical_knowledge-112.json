    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Shampoo is specifically formulated for cleaning the hair and scalp, not the skin. Here are the reasons why shampoo should not be used for washing the skin when showering or bathing:\\n\\n1. Slipperiness: Shampoo is designed to create a slippery texture to help cleanse the hair. However, this slippery texture can make it difficult to thoroughly clean the skin, leading to inadequate cleansing.\\n2. Lather production: Shampoo may not produce sufficient lather when used on the skin. Lather helps to remove dirt, oil, and impurities from the skin, so insufficient lather may result in ineffective cleansing.\\n3. Cost-effectiveness: While cost-effectiveness can be a consideration, it is not the primary reason why shampoo should not be used for washing the skin.\\n4. Dryness of the skin: Shampoo typically contains ingredients that are specifically formulated for the hair and scalp, which may not be suitable for the skin. These ingredients can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness and potential irritation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
