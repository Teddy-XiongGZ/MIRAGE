    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA is composed of nucleotides, which consist of a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are classified into two types: purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine). Deoxyribose is the sugar molecule found in DNA. Amino acids, on the other hand, are the building blocks of proteins and do not form part of DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
