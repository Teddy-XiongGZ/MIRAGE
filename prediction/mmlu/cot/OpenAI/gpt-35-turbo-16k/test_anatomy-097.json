    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mucosa covering the alveolar process supporting the mandibular teeth should have a specific color in a normal healthy mouth. To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the normal color of the mucosa in this area. The mucogingival junction is the line where the attached gingiva meets the alveolar mucosa. In a healthy mouth, the color of the attached gingiva is usually light pink, while the color of the alveolar mucosa is usually darker. Therefore, the correct answer should describe the color of the mucosa below and above the mucogingival junction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
