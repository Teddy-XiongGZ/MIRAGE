    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An early-successional plant community refers to a community that develops after a disturbance, such as a fire or clear-cutting. In these communities, the environment is typically open and resources are readily available. Based on this information, we can eliminate options C and D. K-selected species are typically found in stable environments, not in early-successional communities. Similarly, high detrital biomass is more characteristic of mature ecosystems, not early-successional ones. Now, let's consider options A and B. High niche divergence among co-occurring species refers to the ability of different species to occupy different ecological niches, which is more likely to occur in mature ecosystems. On the other hand, high ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass indicate that the community is producing more biomass relative to the amount of biomass present. This is a characteristic of early-successional communities where there is rapid growth and high productivity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
