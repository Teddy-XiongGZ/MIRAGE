    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angiosperms are a group of plants that produce flowers and fruits. To determine the characteristic unique to angiosperms, we need to consider the options provided. \\n\\nA. Wind-borne pollen: This is not unique to angiosperms as some gymnosperms also have wind-borne pollen. \\n\\nB. A dominant sporophyte life cycle: This is not unique to angiosperms as both angiosperms and gymnosperms have a dominant sporophyte life cycle. \\n\\nC. Alteration of generations: This is not unique to angiosperms as both angiosperms and gymnosperms exhibit alteration of generations. \\n\\nD. Double fertilization: This is a characteristic unique to angiosperms. During double fertilization, one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the zygote, while the other sperm fuses with the polar nuclei to form the endosperm. This process is not observed in any other group of plants. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the characteristic unique to angiosperms is D. Double fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
