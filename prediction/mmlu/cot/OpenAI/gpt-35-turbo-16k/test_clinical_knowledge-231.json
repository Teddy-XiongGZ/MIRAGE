    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In all-out exercise such as sprinting, the first fiber types to fatigue are typically the fast-twitch fibers. Type IIa and Type IIX fibers are both fast-twitch fibers, while Type I and Type Ia fibers are slow-twitch fibers. Since sprinting is an intense and high-intensity activity, it primarily recruits and fatigues the fast-twitch fibers. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Type IIa fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
