    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's blood pressure is already elevated at 165/95 mm Hg. To further increase the blood pressure, we need to identify a mechanism that can contribute to increased resistance to blood flow.

This can occur due to factors such as vasoconstriction, narrowing of blood vessels, or increased arterial stiffness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
