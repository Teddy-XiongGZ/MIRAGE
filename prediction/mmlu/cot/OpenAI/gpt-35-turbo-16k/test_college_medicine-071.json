    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During maximal dynamic exercise, the body primarily relies on anaerobic metabolism for energy production. This is because anaerobic metabolism can produce energy quickly without the need for oxygen. However, as the duration of exercise increases, the body gradually shifts towards aerobic metabolism, which utilizes oxygen to produce energy. This shift occurs because anaerobic metabolism is not sustainable for long periods of time. To determine when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic, we need to consider the time at which the body's energy demands can no longer be met solely by anaerobic metabolism. A. 10 seconds: This is a relatively short duration of time, and it is unlikely that maximal dynamic exercise would become predominantly aerobic within this timeframe. B. 30 seconds: This is a slightly longer duration, but it is still relatively short. While some aerobic metabolism may be occurring at this point, it is unlikely that it would be the predominant source of energy production. C. 1 minute: This is a longer duration of time, and it is possible that maximal dynamic exercise could become predominantly aerobic within this timeframe. However, it is still not the most likely option. D. 4 minutes: This is a significant amount of time for maximal dynamic exercise. At this point, the body's energy demands would likely exceed what can be provided by anaerobic metabolism alone. Therefore, it is most likely that maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic after approximately 4 minutes. Based on this reasoning, the answer is D. 4 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
