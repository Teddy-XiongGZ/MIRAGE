    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transpiration is the process by which water is lost from plants through the stomata in their leaves. It is influenced by various environmental conditions. Let's consider each option:\\n\\nA. High temperature: High temperature increases the rate of transpiration as it causes the water molecules to evaporate more quickly.\\n\\nB. High relative humidity: High relative humidity reduces the rate of transpiration as the air already contains a high amount of moisture, making it difficult for water to evaporate from the leaves.\\n\\nC. Low relative humidity: Low relative humidity increases the rate of transpiration as the air is drier, creating a greater difference in water vapor concentration between the leaves and the air.\\n\\nD. Wind: Wind increases the rate of transpiration as it removes the layer of moist air surrounding the leaves, allowing for faster evaporation.\\n\\nBased on this, the option that does NOT increase the rate of transpiration is B. high relative humidity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
