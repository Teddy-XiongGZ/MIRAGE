    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Recombination, also known as crossing over, is a process that occurs during meiosis. It involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. Recombination is a key event in meiosis and plays a crucial role in generating genetic diversity. Now, let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Metaphase I: Metaphase I is the stage in meiosis where homologous chromosomes align at the equator of the cell. Recombination does not occur at this stage.\\n\\nB. Prophase I: Prophase I is the stage in meiosis where recombination occurs. It is during this stage that homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through crossing over.\\n\\nC. Metaphase II: Metaphase II is the stage in meiosis where sister chromatids align at the equator of the cell. Recombination does not occur at this stage.\\n\\nD. Prophase II: Prophase II is the stage in meiosis where the nuclear envelope breaks down and spindle fibers start to form. Recombination does not occur at this stage.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Prophase I.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
