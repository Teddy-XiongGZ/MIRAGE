    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During high-intensity exercise, the body relies on ATP and phosphocreatine as immediate sources of energy. ATP is the primary energy currency of the body, while phosphocreatine serves as a reservoir for quickly regenerating ATP. The breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine releases energy that can be used for muscle contraction. However, these high-energy phosphates are limited in supply and can only sustain maximal exertion exercise for a short period of time. The exact duration depends on the individual and the intensity of the exercise. Typically, ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 5-10 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
