    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symplastic pathway refers to the movement of substances through the cytoplasm of cells. In the case of sucrose, it is synthesized in the mesophyll cells during photosynthesis and needs to be transported into the phloem for distribution throughout the plant. Step 1: Sucrose is synthesized in the mesophyll cells during photosynthesis. Step 2: The sucrose needs to move from the mesophyll cells into the phloem. Step 3: The symplastic pathway involves the movement of substances through the cytoplasm of cells. Step 4: We need to identify the correct sequence of cells that the sucrose would pass through in the symplastic pathway. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, sieve tube. This sequence represents the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem through the cytoplasm of cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
