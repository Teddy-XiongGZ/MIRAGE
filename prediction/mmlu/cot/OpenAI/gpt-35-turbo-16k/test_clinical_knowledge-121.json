    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first choice for cleaning the mouth should be a tool that is gentle and effective. A small, soft toothbrush is commonly recommended for cleaning the mouth. It is designed to reach all areas of the mouth and remove plaque and debris without causing harm to the gums or teeth. A gloved finger wrapped in gauze can also be used, but it may not be as effective as a toothbrush. Forceps wrapped in gauze are not suitable for cleaning the mouth as they are primarily used for dental extractions. Foam sticks are typically used for applying topical medications or cleaning dentures, but they may not be as effective for cleaning the entire mouth. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Small, soft toothbrush.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
