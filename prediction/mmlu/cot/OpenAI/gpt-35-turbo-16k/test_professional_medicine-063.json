CF is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organs, including the lungs and reproductive system. The hyperinflation seen on the chest x-ray is consistent with CF. To confirm the diagnosis of CF, the sweat chloride test is the most appropriate test. CF is characterized by abnormal chloride transport, leading to increased chloride concentration in sweat. The sweat chloride test measures the concentration of chloride in sweat, and a value above a certain threshold is diagnostic of CF. Therefore, the answer choice is C.
