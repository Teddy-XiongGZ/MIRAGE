    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of paroxysmal episodes of headache, sweating, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting, along with the presence of a left adrenal mass, the most likely diagnosis is a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that secrete excessive amounts of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. To establish the diagnosis, urinary assays that measure the metabolites of catecholamines are typically used. The most commonly measured metabolite is vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), which is produced from the breakdown of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Therefore, the correct answer is D. vanillylmandelic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
