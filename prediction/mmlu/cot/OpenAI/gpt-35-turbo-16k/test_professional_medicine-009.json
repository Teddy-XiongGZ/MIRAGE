    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of passing a renal calculus and increased calcium excretion in the urine. This suggests a possible underlying condition called hypercalciuria, which is characterized by excessive calcium excretion. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for hypercalciuria is a thiazide diuretic, which inhibits the Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to increased reabsorption of calcium. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
