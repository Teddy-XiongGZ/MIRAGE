    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Codeine is a prodrug that is metabolized to morphine by the liver. The analgesic effect of codeine is primarily due to its conversion to morphine. Therefore, if there is a decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine, it can result in poor pain control. This is known as poor codeine metabolism or codeine non-responsiveness. Given that other members of the patient's family also have poor pain control with codeine, it suggests a genetic component to this therapeutic failure. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure is decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
