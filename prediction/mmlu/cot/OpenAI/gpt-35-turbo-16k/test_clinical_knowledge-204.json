    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peripheral neuropathy is a condition that affects the peripheral nerves, which are the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution: This is true in peripheral neuropathy. Sensory loss typically starts in the toes and progresses up the legs, resembling a stocking distribution.\\n\\nB. The tone is increased bilaterally in the legs: Increased tone is not a characteristic finding in peripheral neuropathy. It is more commonly associated with conditions such as spasticity or upper motor neuron lesions.\\n\\nC. Reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement: Reflexes are typically diminished or absent in peripheral neuropathy, not brisk. Brisk reflexes are more commonly seen in conditions such as hyperreflexia or upper motor neuron lesions.\\n\\nD. Weakness is more marked proximally than distally: This is not a characteristic finding in peripheral neuropathy. Weakness in peripheral neuropathy is typically more pronounced distally, affecting the feet and hands first before progressing proximally.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is A. Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
