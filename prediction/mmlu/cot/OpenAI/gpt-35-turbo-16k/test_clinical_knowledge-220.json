    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Passive movements refer to movements that are performed without the individual actively contracting their muscles. These movements are typically performed by an external force, such as another person or a machine. The purpose of passive movements is to stretch the muscles and joints, improve range of motion, and maintain joint mobility. Now let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. Movement with resistance, stretching at end of range: This option involves resistance, which contradicts the definition of passive movements. \\nB. Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range: This option correctly describes passive movements as they involve stretching at the end of the range without resistance. \\nC. Movement with resistance, stopping at end of range: This option involves resistance and stopping at the end of the range, which is not consistent with passive movements. \\nD. Movement without resistance, stopping at end of range: This option involves stopping at the end of the range, which is not consistent with passive movements. \\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
