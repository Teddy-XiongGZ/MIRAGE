    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Twin studies in humans are useful because they allow genetic as opposed to environmental influences on variation in a trait to be estimated. This is because twins share the same genetic background but may be exposed to different environmental factors. By comparing the similarities and differences between identical (monozygotic) twins, who share 100% of their genes, and fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share approximately 50% of their genes, researchers can estimate the contribution of genetics to a particular trait or condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
