The physical examination reveals enlarged, erythematous, tender, fluctuant, and movable axillary lymph nodes. The fine-needle aspirate shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, and the cultures grow yellow, \u03b2-hemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. The polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for MRSA infections is Vancomycin, which is effective against MRSA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Vancomycin\"}"
