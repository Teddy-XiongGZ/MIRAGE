    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutation of homeotic cluster genes in Drosophila can lead to changes in the identity of body segments. These genes are responsible for specifying the developmental fate of each segment along the anterior-posterior axis. The homeotic cluster genes encode transcription factors that control the expression of other genes involved in segment identity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Transformation of one segment into another.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
