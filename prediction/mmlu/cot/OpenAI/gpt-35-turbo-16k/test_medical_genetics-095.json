    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzyme assays are laboratory tests that measure the activity of specific enzymes in the body. These tests can be used to identify carriers of certain genetic disorders that are caused by a deficiency or abnormality in the activity of a specific enzyme. A. Cystic fibrosis is not typically diagnosed using enzyme assays. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is usually based on clinical symptoms, genetic testing, and sweat chloride testing. B. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which is not related to enzyme activity. Enzyme assays are not used to identify carriers of Fragile X syndrome. C. Oculocutaneous albinism is a genetic disorder that affects the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Enzyme assays are not used to identify carriers of oculocutaneous albinism. D. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. Enzyme assays can be used to identify carriers of Tay-Sachs disease by measuring the activity of this enzyme. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Tay-Sachs disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
