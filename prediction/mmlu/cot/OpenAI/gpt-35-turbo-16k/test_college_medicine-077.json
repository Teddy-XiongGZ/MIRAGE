    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sensory adaptation refers to the process by which our sensory receptors become less responsive to constant or repetitive stimuli. This allows us to focus on new or changing stimuli. To determine which option is NOT an example of sensory adaptation, we need to identify the option where the sensory experience does not decrease over time. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. After putting on a shirt, you eventually no longer feel the sensation of the fabric on your back. This is an example of sensory adaptation because the sensation of the fabric on the back decreases over time.\\n\\nB. After first walking into a crowded room, you no longer are distracted by the buzz of conversation around you. This is an example of sensory adaptation because the distraction caused by the buzz of conversation decreases over time.\\n\\nC. After first walking outside on a sunny day, you no longer are blinded by the initial brightness of the light. This is an example of sensory adaptation because the sensitivity to the brightness of the light decreases over time.\\n\\nD. After first walking into an anatomy lab, you no longer notice the smell of formaldehyde. This is NOT an example of sensory adaptation because the ability to detect the smell of formaldehyde does not decrease over time. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
