    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant is presenting with persistent watery diarrhea, which could be a result of malabsorption. The fact that the mother feeds him cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables suggests that the problem may be related to his diet. The dry mucous membranes and slightly distended abdomen indicate dehydration. Given these findings, the most likely cause of the persistent watery diarrhea in this infant is transient lactase deficiency, as lactose intolerance is a common cause of malabsorption in infants. Fructose intolerance is less likely as the infant is consuming fruits and vegetables without any specific mention of symptoms related to fructose intake. Magnesium deficiency and regional enteritis are less likely as they do not typically present with persistent watery diarrhea in infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
