    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. In the context of nucleosomes, DNase can digest the linker DNA between nucleosomes, resulting in the separation of nucleosome monomers. The nucleosome core, which consists of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, remains intact during this process. Therefore, the correct answer is D. linker DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
