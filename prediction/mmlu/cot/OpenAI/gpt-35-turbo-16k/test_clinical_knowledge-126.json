    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Our genetic material refers to the material that carries the genetic information in our cells. This genetic material is responsible for passing on traits from one generation to the next. The two main types of nucleic acids found in cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA is the primary genetic material in most organisms, including humans. It is a double-stranded molecule that contains the instructions for building and maintaining an organism. RNA, on the other hand, is involved in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis. Dinitronucleic acid is not a known type of nucleic acid. Protein, while important for various cellular functions, is not the genetic material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
