    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is rotator cuff tendinitis. The patient's pain started after a specific activity (chopping wood) and is reproduced with resisted external rotation of the shoulder. This is a classic presentation for rotator cuff tendinitis. The rotator cuff is composed of four tendons: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. In this patient, the pain is reproduced with resisted external rotation, which primarily tests the infraspinatus and teres minor tendons. Therefore, the most likely inflamed tendon in this patient is the infraspinatus tendon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
