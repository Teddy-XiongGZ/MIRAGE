    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's analyze each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Increasing the protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. This statement is not entirely true. While protein is essential for muscle growth and strength, there is a limit to how much protein the body can effectively utilize. Consuming excessive amounts of protein beyond what the body needs will not necessarily lead to further muscle growth or strength.\\n\\nB. Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power. This statement is true. Creatine is a naturally occurring compound in the body that plays a role in energy production. Supplementing with creatine has been shown to increase muscle strength and power, particularly during high-intensity, short-duration activities.\\n\\nC. Amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power. This statement is not entirely true. While amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are necessary for muscle growth and repair, simply supplementing with amino acids alone may not directly increase muscle strength and power. Adequate protein intake from a balanced diet is generally sufficient to meet the body's amino acid needs.\\n\\nD. Muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions. This statement is not true. Muscle damage is typically induced by lengthening contractions, also known as eccentric contractions, where the muscle is actively lengthening while under tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
