    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences in vitro. It involves several steps: 1) Denaturation: the DNA template is heated to separate the double-stranded DNA into single strands. 2) Annealing: short DNA primers that are complementary to the target DNA sequence are added and allowed to bind to their respective sequences. 3) Extension: a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme synthesizes new DNA strands by extending from the primers. This process is repeated multiple times to exponentially amplify the target DNA sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
