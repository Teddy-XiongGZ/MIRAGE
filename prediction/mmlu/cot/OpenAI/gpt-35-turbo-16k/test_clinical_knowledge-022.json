    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Once a prescribed unit of blood product has been obtained from the blood bank, it should be handled and stored properly to maintain its quality. Blood products are typically stored in refrigerators to prevent bacterial growth and maintain their viability. Once the blood product is taken out of refrigeration, it starts to warm up and the risk of bacterial contamination increases. Therefore, it is important to initiate the transfusion within a specific period of time to minimize the risk of deterioration. A. 30 minutes: This is a relatively short time frame and may not be sufficient for most transfusions. B. 90 minutes: This is a reasonable time frame and is commonly used as a guideline for initiating transfusions. C. 4 hours: This is a longer time frame and may increase the risk of bacterial contamination and deterioration of the blood product. D. 12 hours: This is a significantly longer time frame and is not recommended for initiating transfusions as it greatly increases the risk of bacterial contamination and deterioration of the blood product. Based on current medical knowledge, the recommended time frame for initiating a transfusion after obtaining a blood product from the blood bank and taking it out of refrigeration is typically within 90 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 90 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
