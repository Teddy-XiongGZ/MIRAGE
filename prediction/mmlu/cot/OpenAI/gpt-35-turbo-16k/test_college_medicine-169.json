    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During DNA replication, mistakes can occur in the leading strand. These mistakes are usually corrected by proofreading mechanisms. In this case, the mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly after the RNA primer is removed. This suggests that the repair mechanism involved is likely to be the one that corrects mismatched bases. Mismatch repair mechanism is responsible for identifying and removing incorrectly paired bases. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Mismatch repair mechanism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
