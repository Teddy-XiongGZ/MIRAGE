    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proprioceptive nerve endings are responsible for providing information about joint position and movement to the brain. They are located in structures within the joint that are sensitive to mechanical changes. The articular cartilage is responsible for reducing friction and providing a smooth surface for joint movement, but it does not contain proprioceptive nerve endings. The synovial membrane lines the joint capsule and produces synovial fluid, which lubricates the joint. While the synovial membrane does not directly contain proprioceptive nerve endings, it is in close proximity to structures that do. The joint capsule is a fibrous structure that surrounds the joint and helps to stabilize it. It contains proprioceptive nerve endings that provide information about joint position and movement. Ligaments are tough bands of connective tissue that connect bones to other bones and help to stabilize the joint. They also contain proprioceptive nerve endings. Articular discs are found in certain joints, such as the temporomandibular joint, and they help to improve joint congruency and stability. They also contain proprioceptive nerve endings. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. capsule and ligaments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
