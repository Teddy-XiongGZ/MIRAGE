    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's go through each option one by one:\\n\\nA. It is not acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle as it can cause unnecessary harm and is not a standard method for assessing pain.\\n\\nB. Proprioception and light touch are appreciated via different tracts. Proprioception is transmitted through the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, while light touch is transmitted through the spinothalamic tract.\\n\\nC. The best way to test vibration sense is by using a 128 Hz tuning fork, not a 256 Hz tuning fork.\\n\\nD. Impulses for pain travel primarily up the spinothalamic tract, not the dorsal columns. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
