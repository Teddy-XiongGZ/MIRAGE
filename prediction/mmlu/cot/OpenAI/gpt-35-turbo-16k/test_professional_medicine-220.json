    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"By setting the alpha level at 0.01 instead of 0.05, the threshold for statistical significance is lowered. This means that the criteria for determining whether the results are statistically significant becomes more stringent. As a result, it becomes more difficult to achieve statistical significance. Therefore, the most likely result is that there is a decreased likelihood of a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This means that the study will have more conservative results and there is a decreased likelihood of reporting statistically significant findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
