    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Circulatory overload refers to a condition where there is an excessive volume of blood or fluid in the circulatory system. This can lead to various signs and symptoms. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia: Hypothermia is not typically associated with circulatory overload. Hypotension (low blood pressure) and bradycardia (slow heart rate) can be seen in circulatory shock, but not specifically in circulatory overload.\\n\\nB. Hypotension, oliguria, and uticaria: Hypotension can be seen in circulatory overload, but oliguria (decreased urine output) and uticaria (hives) are not typical signs.\\n\\nC. Shivering, pyrexia, and thirst: Shivering and pyrexia (fever) are not specific to circulatory overload. Thirst can be seen in dehydration, but not necessarily in circulatory overload.\\n\\nD. Dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins: Dyspnoea (shortness of breath), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and distended neck veins are all indicative signs and symptoms of circulatory overload. These occur due to the increased volume of blood or fluid in the circulatory system, leading to increased pressure and strain on the heart and blood vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
