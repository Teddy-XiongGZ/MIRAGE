    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During swallowing, the lower airway needs to be closed and sealed off to prevent food or liquid from entering the lungs. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Alveoli: Alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. They do not play a role in closing and sealing off the lower airway during swallowing.\\n\\nB. Epiglottis: The epiglottis is a flap of tissue located at the base of the tongue. Its main function is to prevent food or liquid from entering the trachea during swallowing by covering the opening of the larynx.\\n\\nC. Larynx: The larynx, also known as the voice box, contains the vocal cords and is involved in producing sound. It also plays a role in closing and sealing off the lower airway during swallowing.\\n\\nD. Uvula: The uvula is a small, fleshy, teardrop-shaped structure that hangs down from the soft palate at the back of the throat. It helps to close off the nasal passage during swallowing, but it does not directly close and seal off the lower airway.\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is B. Epiglottis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
