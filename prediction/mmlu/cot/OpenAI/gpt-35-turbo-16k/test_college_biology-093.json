    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fungi are a diverse group of organisms that belong to the kingdom Fungi. They are eukaryotic, meaning their cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. This eliminates option A as a potential answer. Fungi also have cell walls, but their cell walls are made of chitin, which is a flexible material. This means that option B is not true. Most fungi are filamentous, meaning they have long, thread-like structures called hyphae. This makes option C a true statement. Finally, fungi are not photosynthetic. They obtain nutrients by absorbing organic matter from their environment. This means that option D is also true. Therefore, the answer is B. They all have rigid cell walls.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
