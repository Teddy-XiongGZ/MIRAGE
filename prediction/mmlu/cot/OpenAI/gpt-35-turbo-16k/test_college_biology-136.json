    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny suggests that recombination has occurred between the linked genes. Crossing over is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. This can result in the separation of linked genes and the production of new combinations of alleles. Independent assortment refers to the random distribution of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, which can result in the production of different combinations of alleles. Segregation of alleles refers to the separation of alleles during meiosis, which can result in the production of different combinations of alleles. Penetrance refers to the proportion of individuals with a particular genotype that show the expected phenotype. In this case, the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies suggests that crossing over has occurred, allowing for the recombination of the linked genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. crossing over\"}"
