    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The teacher's reward system consists of two components: giving stickers for showing up on time daily and giving stickers for getting above 90% on three quizzes in a row weekly. The observation is that performance on quizzes has increased significantly but tardiness has only decreased slightly. A. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction. This option is not relevant to the situation because the teacher is not using a variable ratio schedule. B. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time. This option suggests that the students were more motivated to perform well on quizzes, which resulted in improved quiz performance. However, it does not explain why tardiness only decreased slightly. C. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule. This option suggests that the students responded better to the fixed-ratio schedule of receiving stickers for getting above 90% on three quizzes in a row. This could explain the significant improvement in quiz performance. However, it does not explain why tardiness only decreased slightly. D. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule. This option suggests that the students responded better to the fixed-ratio schedule of receiving stickers for getting above 90% on three quizzes in a row. This could explain the significant improvement in quiz performance. It also suggests that the variable-interval schedule of giving stickers for showing up on time daily was not as effective in reducing tardiness. Based on the given options, option D is the best explanation for the teacher's observation. The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule (getting above 90% on three quizzes in a row) than it was to a variable-interval schedule (showing up on time daily), resulting in significant improvement in quiz performance but only a slight decrease in tardiness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
