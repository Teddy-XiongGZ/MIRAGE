    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Homeostasis is the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. Mammals are known for their ability to regulate various physiological parameters. To determine which of the given options mammals are not homeostatic for, we need to consider each option. A. Body temperature: Mammals are homeostatic for body temperature and have mechanisms to regulate it. B. Blood glucose concentration: Mammals are homeostatic for blood glucose concentration and have mechanisms like insulin and glucagon to regulate it. C. Blood pH: Mammals are homeostatic for blood pH and have buffers and respiratory mechanisms to maintain it within a narrow range. D. Metabolic rate: Metabolic rate refers to the rate at which an organism uses energy. Mammals can regulate their metabolic rate to some extent through various factors like activity level, but it is not as tightly regulated as the other options. Therefore, the correct answer is D. metabolic rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
