    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath, which are consistent with atrial fibrillation. The initial treatment with metoprolol helped to slow down the patient's heart rate, but now the pulse has increased again. To further decrease the patient's pulse, a medication with negative chronotropic effects should be administered. Digoxin is a medication commonly used for atrial fibrillation, but it has a slower onset of action and is not the best choice for acute rate control. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and does not have direct effects on heart rate. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and is not indicated for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Metoprolol, on the other hand, is a beta-blocker and has negative chronotropic effects, making it the most appropriate choice for further rate control in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Metoprolol\"}"
