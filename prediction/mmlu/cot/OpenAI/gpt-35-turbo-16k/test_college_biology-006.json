    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Barr body is a condensed, inactive X chromosome found in the nuclei of female mammalian cells. It is formed through a process called X chromosome inactivation, which occurs randomly during early embryonic development. This inactivation ensures that females, who have two X chromosomes, have the same gene dosage as males, who have one X and one Y chromosome. The Barr body is an example of heterochromatin, which is a tightly packed and transcriptionally inactive form of chromatin. Therefore, the correct answer is B. heterochromatin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
