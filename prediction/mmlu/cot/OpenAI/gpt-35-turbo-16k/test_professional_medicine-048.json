    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is Rh-negative, and the father is Rh-positive. This means that the fetus has a 50% chance of being Rh-positive. If the fetus is Rh-positive, there is a risk of maternal sensitization to the Rh antigen, leading to the formation of antibodies against RhD. These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in subsequent pregnancies. To prevent sensitization, the mother should receive Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) at 28 weeks' gestation and within 72 hours after delivery if the newborn is Rh-positive. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Formation of antibodies to RhD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
