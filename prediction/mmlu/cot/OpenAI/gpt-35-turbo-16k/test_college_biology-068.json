    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angiosperms and gymnosperms are two types of seed-bearing plants. To distinguish between them, we can consider the characteristics of each option. \\n\\nA. Perennial growth: Both angiosperms and gymnosperms can exhibit perennial growth, so this characteristic does not distinguish between the two. \\n\\nB. True roots: Both angiosperms and gymnosperms have true roots, so this characteristic does not distinguish between the two. \\n\\nC. Apical growth: Both angiosperms and gymnosperms exhibit apical growth, so this characteristic does not distinguish between the two. \\n\\nD. Seeds enclosed in ovaries: This characteristic is unique to angiosperms. Angiosperms have flowers with ovaries that enclose the seeds, while gymnosperms have naked seeds that are not enclosed in ovaries. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Seeds enclosed in ovaries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
