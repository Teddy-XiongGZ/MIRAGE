    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A thyroid swelling, also known as a thyroid nodule, can have various characteristics and presentations. Let's evaluate each option one by one to determine which one is true about a thyroid swelling. \\n\\nA. It always elevates on swallowing: This statement is not true. While some thyroid nodules may elevate on swallowing, it is not a universal finding. The movement of a thyroid nodule with swallowing depends on its location and size.\\n\\nB. Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign: This statement is not true. Lymph node enlargement in the neck is not a good prognostic sign for a thyroid swelling. It may indicate the spread of cancer or inflammation.\\n\\nC. An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone: This statement is not true. An ultrasound can provide information about the size, shape, and characteristics of a thyroid nodule, but it cannot determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. Hormone secretion is typically assessed through blood tests.\\n\\nD. A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer: This statement is true. A functioning nodule on isotope scanning, also known as a thyroid scan, is less likely to be due to cancer. Functioning nodules are usually benign and produce thyroid hormone. Cancerous nodules are more likely to be non-functioning and do not take up the isotope on scanning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
