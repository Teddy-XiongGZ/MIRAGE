    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's evaluate each statement one by one to determine which one is false. \\n\\nA. Phosphofructokinase is the rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis. This statement is true. Phosphofructokinase is indeed the rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis, as it catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.\\n\\nB. Phosphorylase activity is higher in Type II fibres than in Type I fibres. This statement is true. Type II muscle fibers, also known as fast-twitch fibers, have higher levels of phosphorylase activity compared to Type I muscle fibers, which are slow-twitch fibers.\\n\\nC. Endurance training increases the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle. This statement is true. Endurance training can lead to an increase in the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle, allowing for improved aerobic metabolism and energy production.\\n\\nD. Oxygen is consumed in the TCA cycle. This statement is false. While oxygen is required for the complete oxidation of glucose in aerobic respiration, it is not directly consumed in the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle takes place in the mitochondria and generates reduced coenzymes (NADH and FADH2) that are then used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen is consumed in the electron transport chain, not the TCA cycle itself.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the false statement is D. Oxygen is consumed in the TCA cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
