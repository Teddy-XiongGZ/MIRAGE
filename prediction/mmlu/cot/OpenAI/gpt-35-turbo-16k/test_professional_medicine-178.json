    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 86-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cor pulmonale. She has a history of recent hospitalization for pneumonia requiring intubation and complicated by sepsis. Prior to discharge, the patient expressed her preference to not be intubated again. Currently, she is experiencing worsening shortness of breath at rest and is unable to complete a sentence. Her oxygen saturation is low despite receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient has clearly stated her wish to die at home. The daughter, however, disagrees and insists on hospital admission. Given the patient's advanced age, severe underlying lung disease, and her expressed preference to die at home, the most appropriate step would be to arrange for consultation with a home hospice team. This will allow for appropriate management of the patient's symptoms and support for both the patient and her family in the home setting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
