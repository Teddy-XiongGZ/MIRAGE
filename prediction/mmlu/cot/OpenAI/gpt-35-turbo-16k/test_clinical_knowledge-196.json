    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A hypertonic solution is a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. This means that there are more dissolved particles in the solution compared to inside the cell. When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water will move out of the cell in an attempt to equalize the concentration of solutes on both sides of the cell membrane. This can cause the cell to shrink or become dehydrated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
