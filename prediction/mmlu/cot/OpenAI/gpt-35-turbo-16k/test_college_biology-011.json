    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which destination requires two different signal peptides, we need to understand the targeting of newly synthesized proteins. Signal peptides are short amino acid sequences that direct proteins to specific cellular compartments. The signal peptide is recognized by a signal recognition particle (SRP) which then targets the protein to the appropriate destination. In some cases, proteins may require multiple signal peptides to reach their final destination. A. Plasma membrane: Proteins targeted to the plasma membrane typically have a single signal peptide that directs them to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the ER, the proteins are further processed and transported to the plasma membrane. Therefore, only one signal peptide is required for targeting to the plasma membrane. B. Lysosome: Proteins targeted to the lysosome also typically have a single signal peptide that directs them to the ER. From the ER, the proteins are further processed and transported to the lysosome. Therefore, only one signal peptide is required for targeting to the lysosome. C. Cytosol: Proteins targeted to the cytosol do not require a signal peptide. They are synthesized on free ribosomes and remain in the cytosol. D. Chloroplast: Proteins targeted to the chloroplast require two different signal peptides. The first signal peptide directs the protein to the ER, and the second signal peptide directs the protein from the ER to the chloroplast. Therefore, two different signal peptides are required for targeting to the chloroplast. Based on this information, the answer is D. Chloroplast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
