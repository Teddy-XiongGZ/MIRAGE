    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are biological catalysts that facilitate chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. This means that enzymes provide an alternative pathway for the reaction to proceed with a lower energy barrier. By lowering the activation energy, enzymes increase the rate at which reactants are converted to products. This eliminates the need for high temperatures (choice A) or altering the equilibrium constant (choice B) to facilitate the reaction. Therefore, the correct answer is D. They lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
