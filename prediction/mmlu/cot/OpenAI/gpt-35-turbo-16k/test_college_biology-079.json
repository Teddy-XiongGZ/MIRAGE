    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the phenotypic ratio of the progeny, we need to consider the possible combinations of alleles that can be inherited from the parents. The tall plant parent has the genotype DDWw, which means it can pass on either a D or a W allele to its offspring. The dwarf plant parent has the genotype ddww, which means it can only pass on d and w alleles. When we cross these parents, there are four possible combinations of alleles that the offspring can inherit: DW, Dw, dW, and dw. The DW combination will result in a tall violet plant, the Dw combination will result in a tall white plant, the dW combination will result in a dwarf violet plant, and the dw combination will result in a dwarf white plant. Since each combination is equally likely, the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white\"}"
