    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue indicates damage to the lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve. The mandibular trigeminal nerve (V3) provides sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (VII) carries taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but not somatic sensation. The lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) provides sensory innervation to the posterior one-third of the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve (XII) innervates the muscles of the tongue, but does not provide sensory innervation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
