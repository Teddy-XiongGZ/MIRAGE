    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adenoviruses are commonly used in gene therapy due to their unique advantages. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Long term expression: Adenoviruses are not ideal for long term expression as they do not integrate into the host genome and their expression is transient.\\n\\nB. Low risk of insertional mutagenesis: Adenoviruses do not integrate into the host genome, reducing the risk of insertional mutagenesis.\\n\\nC. Low immunogenicity: Adenoviruses can elicit a strong immune response in the host, making them less suitable for repeated administration.\\n\\nD. Easy assembly: Adenoviruses are relatively easy to assemble and produce in the laboratory.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is B. Low risk of insertional mutagenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
