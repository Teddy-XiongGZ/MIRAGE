    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High blood ammonia levels can occur in various metabolic disorders. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Galactosaemia: Galactosaemia is a disorder that affects the body's ability to process galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. It does not directly cause high blood ammonia levels.\\n\\nB. Hurler's syndrome: Hurler's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of certain substances. It primarily affects the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and does not directly cause high blood ammonia levels.\\n\\nC. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency: OTC deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the body. In this condition, the body is unable to convert ammonia into urea, leading to high blood ammonia levels. Therefore, OTC deficiency can cause high blood ammonia levels.\\n\\nD. Phenylketonuria: Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. It does not directly cause high blood ammonia levels.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
