    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The chain of survival is a sequence of actions that, when performed in the correct order, can greatly increase the chances of survival for someone experiencing a cardiac arrest. Let's go through the steps: \\n\\n1. Recognition and call for help early: The first step is to recognize the signs of cardiac arrest and immediately call for emergency medical help. This ensures that professional help is on the way.\\n\\n2. Early CPR: CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be started as soon as possible. CPR helps to maintain blood flow and oxygenation to the vital organs until advanced medical care can be provided.\\n\\n3. Early defibrillation: Defibrillation is the delivery of an electric shock to the heart to restore its normal rhythm. Early defibrillation is crucial in cases of cardiac arrest caused by certain types of abnormal heart rhythms, such as ventricular fibrillation. It should be performed as soon as a defibrillator is available.\\n\\n4. Post-resuscitation care: After the person's heart has been successfully restarted, post-resuscitation care is provided to stabilize the person's condition, manage any underlying causes, and prevent further complications.\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct order of the chain of survival is: 3, 2, 1, 4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 3, 2, 1, 4.\"}"
