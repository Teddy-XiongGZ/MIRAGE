    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle lactate production is closely related to the process of glycolysis. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose to produce energy in the form of ATP. During intense exercise or when oxygen supply is limited, glycolysis is activated to meet the energy demands. This leads to the production of pyruvate, which can be further converted to lactate in the presence of an enzyme called lactate dehydrogenase. Therefore, the correct answer is D. glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
