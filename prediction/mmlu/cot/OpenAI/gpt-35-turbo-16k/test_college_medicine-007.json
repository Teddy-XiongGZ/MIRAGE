    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DFP binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase (ACE) and renders it permanently inactive. This indicates that the binding is not reversible. Additionally, DFP does not compete with the substrate for binding to ACE. Therefore, it is not a competitive inhibitor. Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds to a site other than the active site and still affects the enzyme's activity. However, in this case, DFP binds to the active site of ACE. Therefore, the best characterization for the interaction between DFP and ACE is irreversible inhibition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Irreversible inhibition\"}"
