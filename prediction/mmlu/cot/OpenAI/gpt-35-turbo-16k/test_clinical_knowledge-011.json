    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A lower motor neurone lesion in the arm refers to damage or dysfunction of the motor neurons that originate in the spinal cord and directly innervate the muscles of the arm. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Increased tone in the arm (hypertonia) is not a characteristic of a lower motor neurone lesion. It is more commonly associated with an upper motor neurone lesion.\\n\\nB. Fasciculations, which are involuntary muscle twitches, can be seen in lower motor neurone lesions. Therefore, this statement is false.\\n\\nC. The reflexes are typically reduced or absent in a lower motor neurone lesion. Therefore, this statement is false.\\n\\nD. An ulna nerve palsy is an example of a peripheral nerve lesion, not a lower motor neurone lesion. Therefore, this statement is false.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. Fasciculations are never seen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
