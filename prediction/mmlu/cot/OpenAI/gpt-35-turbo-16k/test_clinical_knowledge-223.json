    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is present in the blood of many individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. It is estimated that rheumatoid factor is present in about 70-80% of rheumatoid arthritis cases, not 25%. \\nStep 2: Oligoarthropathy refers to arthritis that affects a few joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is a chronic inflammatory disease that typically affects multiple joints. Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis is not an example of an oligoarthropathy. \\nStep 3: Anaemia can occur in rheumatoid arthritis due to chronic inflammation and the effects on the bone marrow. Therefore, anaemia is a common finding in rheumatoid arthritis. \\nStep 4: Heberden's nodes are bony swellings that can develop in the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. They are a feature of osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis. \\nBased on the above steps, the correct answer is C. Anaemia is a common finding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
