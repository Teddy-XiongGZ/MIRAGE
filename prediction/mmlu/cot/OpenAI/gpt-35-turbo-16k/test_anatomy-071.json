    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the substance that aids the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, we need to consider the options provided. \\n\\nA. Acetylcholine: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in transmitting nerve impulses to the muscles. It is released from the nerve endings and binds to receptors on the muscle cells, leading to muscle contraction. \\n\\nB. Cholecystokinin: Cholecystokinin is a hormone that is primarily involved in the digestion and regulation of appetite. It does not play a role in the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. \\n\\nC. Deoxyribose: Deoxyribose is a sugar molecule that is a component of DNA. It is not involved in the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. \\n\\nD. Oxytocin: Oxytocin is a hormone that is involved in various physiological processes, including childbirth and lactation. It does not aid in the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is A. Acetylcholine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
