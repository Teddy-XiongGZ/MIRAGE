    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the daily dose in grams, we need to multiply the dose per administration by the number of administrations per day. The dose per administration is 960 mg and it is prescribed every 12 hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so there are 2 administrations per day. Therefore, the daily dose in grams is 960 mg * 2 = 1920 mg. To convert mg to grams, we divide by 1000. So, the daily dose in grams is 1920 mg / 1000 = 1.92 grams.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
