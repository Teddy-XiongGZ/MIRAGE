The presence of a nodular cervix with an irregular, friable posterior lip, and a rock-hard, irregular, immobile pelvic mass suggests locally advanced disease. The biopsy specimens show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, which is the most common type of cervical cancer. The pathogenesis of cervical cancer is most commonly associated with infection by high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV types 16 and 18.

Inactivation of cellular p53.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
