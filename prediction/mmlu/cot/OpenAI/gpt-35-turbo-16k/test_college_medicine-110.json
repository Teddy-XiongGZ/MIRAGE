    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Type I muscle fibers are also known as slow-twitch fibers. They are characterized by their high oxidative capacity and are rich in mitochondria and myoglobin. These fibers are also red in color due to the presence of myoglobin. Slow-twitch fibers contract slowly but are highly resistant to fatigue. They primarily rely on aerobic metabolism and are therefore oxidative in nature. Based on these characteristics, the correct answer is C. red, oxidative, fast contracting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
