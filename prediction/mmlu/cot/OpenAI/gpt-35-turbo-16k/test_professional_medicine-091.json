    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To estimate the statistical power in this study, we need to consider the probability of correctly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy. The statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the effectiveness of Drug X is the same as the standard therapy. The investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Therefore, the statistical power would be 1 - 10% = 90%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 90%\"}"
