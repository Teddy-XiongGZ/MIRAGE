    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with acute onset of word-finding difficulty, weakness, and sensory loss of the right arm and leg, along with nonfluent aphasia. These symptoms are suggestive of a stroke. Given the patient's risk factors for stroke (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation), it is important to evaluate for a possible ischemic stroke. The next step in diagnosis should be to obtain a CT scan of the head to evaluate for any acute intracranial pathology, such as a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. Carotid duplex ultrasonography may be considered later to assess for carotid artery stenosis as a potential cause of the stroke. EEG is not indicated in this case as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a focal neurological deficit rather than a seizure disorder. Lumbar puncture is not indicated in the acute setting of a suspected stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
