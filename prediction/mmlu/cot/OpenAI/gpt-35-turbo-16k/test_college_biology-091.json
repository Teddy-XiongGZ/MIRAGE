    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phalloidin is a toxin that specifically binds to actin subunits and disrupts actin function. Actin is a major component of microfilaments, which are thin filaments involved in cell movement, muscle contraction, and cell shape maintenance. Therefore, the structure most directly affected by phalloidin would be microfilaments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
