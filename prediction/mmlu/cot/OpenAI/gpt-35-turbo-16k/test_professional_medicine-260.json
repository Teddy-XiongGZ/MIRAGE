    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and symptoms, it is likely that he is experiencing an allergic reaction to bee stings. The fact that his symptoms have been progressively worsening with each sting suggests that he may be at risk for a severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, in the future. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening reaction that can cause difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, and other serious symptoms. Given this risk, the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition would be to carry self-injectable epinephrine. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and can rapidly reverse the symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. Avoiding areas known to have bees or wearing colorful clothing outside may help reduce the risk of being stung, but it does not address the potential for a severe allergic reaction. Carrying diphenhydramine tablets, while helpful for treating mild allergic reactions, is not sufficient for managing anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Carrying self-injectable epinephrine\"}"
