    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepatomegaly refers to an enlarged liver. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is true of hepatomegaly. \\n\\nA. Emphysema is a cause: Emphysema is a lung condition characterized by damage to the air sacs in the lungs. It is not directly related to hepatomegaly. \\n\\nB. The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium: This statement is incorrect. The liver enlarges upwards towards the right hypochondrium, not downwards from the left hypochondrium. \\n\\nC. The presence of jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause: This statement is partially true. The presence of jaundice, spider naevi (spider veins), and purpura (purple discoloration of the skin) can suggest alcohol as a cause of hepatomegaly, but it is not specific to alcohol and can be seen in other liver diseases as well. \\n\\nD. The liver is usually resonant to percussion: This statement is incorrect. The liver is typically dull to percussion due to its solid nature. \\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the correct answer is C. The presence of jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
