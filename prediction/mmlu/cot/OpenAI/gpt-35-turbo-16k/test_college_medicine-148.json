    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to attachment theory, the most likely child to attach to a male psychologist, previously unknown to the child, would be the child who has experienced inconsistent or neglectful caregiving. This is because attachment theory suggests that children who have not formed a secure attachment with their primary caregiver may be more likely to seek attachment with other individuals. Therefore, the child who is most likely to attach to the male psychologist would be the one who has experienced neglectful caregiving. Step 1: Evaluate the options: A. A two month old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment - This child is raised in a safe and stable environment, which suggests that she is likely to have formed a secure attachment with her primary caregiver. Therefore, she may be less likely to attach to the male psychologist. B. A five month old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment - Similar to option A, this child is raised in a safe and stable environment, indicating a higher likelihood of a secure attachment with the primary caregiver. Therefore, he may be less likely to attach to the male psychologist. C. An eight month old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child - This child has experienced neglectful caregiving, which may have hindered the formation of a secure attachment with the primary caregiver. As a result, he may be more likely to attach to the male psychologist. D. A thirteen month old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child - Although this child has experienced occasional neglect, she has also been raised by two caregivers, which may have provided some level of stability and support. Therefore, she may be less likely to attach to the male psychologist. Step 2: Compare the options: Based on the evaluation of the options, the eight month old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child (option C) is the most likely to attach to the male psychologist, previously unknown to the child. Step 3: Final answer: The most likely child to attach to a male psychologist, previously unknown to the child, in the course of a psychological study is an eight month old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child (option C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
