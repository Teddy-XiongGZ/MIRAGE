    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Most new mutations are either neutral or deleterious. Beneficial mutations are relatively rare compared to neutral or deleterious mutations. Mutations can be neutral if they do not have a significant effect on the organism's fitness or phenotype. Deleterious mutations are harmful and can have negative effects on the organism's fitness or phenotype. The presence of mutations in homozygotes or heterozygotes is not directly related to the nature of the mutation itself. Allozyme studies (protein electrophoresis) can be used to detect genetic variation, but it is not specific to new mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. neutral or deleterious\"}"
