    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the environmental temperature increases, the body needs to cool down to maintain its core temperature. One way the body compensates for increased environmental temperature is by increasing the respiration rate. This helps to increase the evaporation of water from the respiratory system, which helps to cool down the body. Another way the body compensates is by increasing the heart rate. This helps to circulate blood faster, which can aid in heat dissipation. Additionally, the body may also increase water lost through the skin through sweating, which helps to cool down the body. Decreasing salt retention is not a direct compensation mechanism for increased environmental temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is either B. increasing respiration rate, C. increasing heart rate, or D. increasing water lost through skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/C/D\"}"
