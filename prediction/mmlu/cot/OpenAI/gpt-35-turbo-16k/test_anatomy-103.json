    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endochondral ossification is the process by which bones develop from a cartilage model. It involves the replacement of cartilage with bone tissue. To determine which bones develop by endochondral ossification, we need to consider the embryonic development of bones. The ribs, sternum, clavicle, and vertebrae are all bones that develop during embryonic development. The ribs and sternum develop from cartilage models, so they undergo endochondral ossification. The clavicle, on the other hand, develops through a different process called intramembranous ossification, where bone tissue forms directly without a cartilage model. The vertebrae also develop through a combination of endochondral and intramembranous ossification. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The ribs, sternum, and clavicle develop by endochondral ossification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
