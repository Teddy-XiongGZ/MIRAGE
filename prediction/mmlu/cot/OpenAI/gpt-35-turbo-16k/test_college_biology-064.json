    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the cardiac cycle, the ventricles contract and pump blood into the arteries, resulting in an increase in arterial pressure. At the same time, blood returns to the heart from the veins, causing an increase in venous pressure. However, the transfer of blood from the venous side to the arterial side does not result in equal and opposite changes in pressure. Instead, the increase in arterial pressure is larger than the increase in venous pressure. This is because the arterial system is less compliant and has a higher resistance compared to the venous system. Therefore, the correct answer is D. little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
