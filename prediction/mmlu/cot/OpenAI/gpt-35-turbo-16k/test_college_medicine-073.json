    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When Mg(OH)2 is dissolved in water, it dissociates into Mg2+ and 2OH-. The solubility product constant (Ksp) for Mg(OH)2 is given by the equation Ksp = [Mg2+][OH-]^2. When HCl is added, it reacts with the OH- ions to form water (H2O) and Cl- ions. This reaction shifts the equilibrium of the dissolution of Mg(OH)2 to the left, causing Mg(OH)2 to precipitate. Therefore, the answer is B. Mg(OH)2 precipitates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
