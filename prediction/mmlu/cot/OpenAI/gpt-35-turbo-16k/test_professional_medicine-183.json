    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 22-year-old woman who recently received a kidney transplant and is now presenting with cold symptoms and progressive fatigue. She also has an elevated temperature and increased urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations, suggesting allograft rejection. To determine the infectious agent responsible for her symptoms, we need to consider the most common infections in transplant recipients. Adenovirus, BK virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Herpes simplex virus are all potential pathogens in this population. However, the clinical presentation of cold symptoms and fatigue is most consistent with an infection caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is known to cause infectious mononucleosis, which presents with symptoms such as sore throat, fatigue, and fever. Therefore, the answer choice is C. Epstein-Barr virus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
