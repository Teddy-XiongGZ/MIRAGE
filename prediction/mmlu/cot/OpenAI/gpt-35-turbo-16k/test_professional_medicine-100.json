    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of sudden onset shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating, along with the presence of a diastolic blowing murmur and decreased femoral pulses, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition characterized by a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta, leading to the formation of a false lumen. The tearing of the aorta can cause severe chest pain that radiates to the back, shortness of breath, and signs of decreased blood flow to the lower extremities. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG suggests long-standing hypertension, which is a risk factor for aortic dissection. Acute myocardial infarction typically presents with chest pain that is not described as tearing or radiating to the back, and the presence of a diastolic blowing murmur and decreased femoral pulses are not consistent with this diagnosis. Esophageal rupture would typically present with severe retrosternal chest pain and signs of mediastinitis, such as subcutaneous emphysema or fever. Mitral valve prolapse is unlikely to cause the sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath, and it would not explain the decreased femoral pulses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Aortic dissection\"}"
