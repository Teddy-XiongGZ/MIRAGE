    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The muscles of the soft palate are responsible for various functions such as closing off the nasal cavity during swallowing and speech. To determine the innervation of these muscles, we need to consider the nerves that supply the soft palate. The trigeminal nerve (CN V) is responsible for sensory innervation of the face, including the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity and the hard palate. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) is responsible for sensory innervation of the posterior third of the tongue and the oropharynx. The facial nerve (CN VII) is responsible for motor innervation of the muscles of facial expression. The vagus nerve (CN X) is responsible for motor innervation of the muscles of the pharynx and larynx. Considering these facts, the correct answer is C. trigeminal and vagus nerves.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
