    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rational choice theory is based on the concept that actions are chosen based on the benefit to the individual. The three main assumptions of rational theory are completeness, transitivity, and independence of variables. These assumptions suggest that individuals have complete and consistent preferences, that they can rank their preferences in a logical and consistent manner, and that their choices are not influenced by external factors. None of the given choices (A. Hierarchical, B. Patriarchal, C. Matriarchal, D. Oligarchic) accurately describe a system based on the assumptions of rational choice theory. Therefore, the answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
