    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 37-year-old woman with AIDS presenting with progressive diarrhea and weight loss. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. The most likely causal organism in this patient is determined by considering the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. In patients with a CD4+ count less than 50/mm3, Cryptosporidium parvum is the most likely cause. In patients with a CD4+ count between 50-100/mm3, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex is the most likely cause. In patients with a CD4+ count greater than 100/mm3, Cytomegalovirus is the most likely cause. In this case, the patient's CD4+ count is 400/mm3, which is greater than 100/mm3, so the most likely causal organism is Cytomegalovirus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
