    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process described in the question involves the movement of H+ ions from outside the mitochondrial membrane to the inside. This movement is against the concentration gradient, meaning it requires energy. Therefore, it is not a passive process. Additionally, endocytosis is a process by which cells engulf substances from the outside, which is not relevant to the movement of H+ ions. This leaves us with two potential choices: passive transport and active transport. Passive diffusion is a type of passive transport that occurs down the concentration gradient without the need for energy. However, in this case, the movement of H+ ions is against the concentration gradient and requires energy. Therefore, the correct answer is active transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Active transport\"}"
