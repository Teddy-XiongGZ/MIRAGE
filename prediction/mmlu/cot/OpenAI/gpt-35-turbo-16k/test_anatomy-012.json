    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that connects the jawbone to the skull. Let's evaluate each statement to determine which one is true. \\n\\nA. It has an articular disc of hyaline cartilage: The TMJ does have an articular disc, but it is composed of fibrocartilage, not hyaline cartilage. Therefore, statement A is false. \\n\\nB. Its articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage: This statement is true. The articular surfaces of the TMJ are covered by hyaline cartilage, which helps to reduce friction and allow smooth movement. \\n\\nC. Proprioceptive information is carried by the chorda tympani and deep temporal nerves: The chorda tympani and deep temporal nerves are not involved in carrying proprioceptive information for the TMJ. Therefore, statement C is false. \\n\\nD. Proprioceptive information is carried by the masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves: This statement is true. The masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves are responsible for carrying proprioceptive information from the TMJ to the brain. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Its articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
