    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most common chromosome abnormality in first trimester spontaneous miscarriages is usually trisomy. Trisomy refers to the presence of an extra copy of a chromosome, resulting in a total of three copies instead of the usual two. This can occur due to errors in chromosome segregation during meiosis, leading to an embryo with an abnormal number of chromosomes. Monosomy refers to the absence of one copy of a chromosome, which is less common in spontaneous miscarriages. Triploidy refers to the presence of an extra set of chromosomes, resulting in a total of three sets instead of the usual two, and it is also less common in spontaneous miscarriages. Tetrasomy refers to the presence of an extra pair of chromosomes, resulting in a total of four copies instead of the usual two, and it is extremely rare in spontaneous miscarriages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
