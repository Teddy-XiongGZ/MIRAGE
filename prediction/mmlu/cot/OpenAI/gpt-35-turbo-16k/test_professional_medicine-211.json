    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient and her mother both have the same single nucleotide change. To determine the significance of this change, we need to consider the clinical presentation and the frequency of the change in the general population. The patient exhibits features consistent with Marfan syndrome, including tall stature, joint laxity, and dental crowding. Additionally, the patient's height is at the 95th percentile, which is characteristic of Marfan syndrome. The single nucleotide change is also found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome, indicating that it is not specific to the disease. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is B. It is a polymorphism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
