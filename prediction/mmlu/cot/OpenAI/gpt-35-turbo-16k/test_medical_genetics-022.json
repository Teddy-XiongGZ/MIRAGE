    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that the gene responsible for G6PD deficiency is located on the X chromosome. In males, who have one X chromosome, a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder. In females, who have two X chromosomes, both copies of the gene would need to be mutated for the disorder to be present. Therefore, G6PD deficiency follows an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. X-linked recessive.\"}"
