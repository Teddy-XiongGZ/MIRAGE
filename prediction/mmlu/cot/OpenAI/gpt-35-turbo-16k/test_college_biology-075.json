Cyanobacteria are actually classified under the kingdom Bacteria, not Protista. \\n\\nC. They are heterotrophic: This is not universally true. While many protists are heterotrophic, some are autotrophic and can perform photosynthesis. \\n\\nD. They possess cell walls composed of peptidoglycan: This is not true. Protists do not possess cell walls composed of peptidoglycan, which is a characteristic of bacteria. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A.
