    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fast-twitch fibers are a type of muscle fibers that are responsible for generating quick and powerful contractions. To determine the characteristics of fast-twitch fibers, we need to consider the role of mitochondria and ATPase activity. Mitochondria are responsible for producing ATP, which is the energy source for muscle contractions. ATPase is an enzyme that breaks down ATP to release energy. Since fast-twitch fibers require a high amount of energy for quick contractions, they would likely have a relatively high ATPase activity. Additionally, since mitochondria produce ATP, fast-twitch fibers would also require a relatively large number of mitochondria to meet their energy demands. Therefore, the correct answer is D. a relatively large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
