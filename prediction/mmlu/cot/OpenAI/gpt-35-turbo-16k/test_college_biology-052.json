    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's analyze each statement one by one to determine which one is incorrect. \\n\\nA. The suspensor is derived from the basal cell. This statement is correct. The suspensor is a structure that supports the developing embryo and is derived from the basal cell.\\n\\nB. Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell. This statement is correct. The apical cell gives rise to the cotyledons, which are the embryonic leaves of the plant.\\n\\nC. Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation. This statement is correct. The shoot apical meristem, which is responsible for the growth of the shoot system, develops after seed formation.\\n\\nD. Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis. This statement is correct. During embryogenesis, the precursors of the three plant tissue systems (dermal, ground, and vascular) are formed.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, all of the statements are correct, so the answer is: \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
