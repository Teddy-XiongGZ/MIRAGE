    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A surgical support can be used for various purposes related to stomas. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Prolapsed stomas: A prolapsed stoma occurs when the stoma protrudes from the abdominal wall. A surgical support, such as a stoma belt or a stoma guard, can help in providing support and preventing further prolapse.\\n\\nB. High output stomas: High output stomas refer to stomas that produce a large amount of output, such as in cases of ileostomies. A surgical support, such as an ostomy pouch with a high capacity, can help in managing and containing the output.\\n\\nC. Herniation around the stoma: Herniation around the stoma can occur when the abdominal wall weakens or there is a defect, leading to the protrusion of abdominal contents. In such cases, a surgical support, such as a hernia belt or a support garment, can help in providing support and reducing the risk of further herniation.\\n\\nD. Retraction of the stoma: Stoma retraction refers to the sinking or pulling back of the stoma into the abdominal wall. A surgical support, such as a convex ostomy appliance or a stoma collar, can help in providing support and preventing retraction.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, it can be concluded that a surgical support can be used for all of the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
