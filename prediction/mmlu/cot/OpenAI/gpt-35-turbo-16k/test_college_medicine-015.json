    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell, we need to identify the power level at which the minimum number of mice pressed the lever. From the given information, we can see that at 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever, at 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever, and at 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever. Since the number of mice pressing the lever decreases as the power level decreases, the power level at which the minimum number of mice pressed the lever corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing. Therefore, the answer is C. 60%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
