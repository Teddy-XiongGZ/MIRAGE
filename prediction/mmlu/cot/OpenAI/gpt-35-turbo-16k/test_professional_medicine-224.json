    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, she most likely has peritonsillar abscess, which is a complication of tonsillitis. The presence of fever, sore throat, change in voice, increased pain with swallowing, and trismus are consistent with peritonsillar abscess. The examination findings of erythema, edema, anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate, deviated uvula, and white exudate on the right tonsil further support this diagnosis. The enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes suggest lymphadenitis. The most appropriate management for peritonsillar abscess is incision and drainage, as this allows for drainage of the purulent material and resolution of symptoms. Antibiotic therapy alone is not sufficient to treat the abscess. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy is not indicated in the management of peritonsillar abscess. Oral nystatin therapy is used for the treatment of oral candidiasis, which is not the likely diagnosis in this case. Salt water gargle may provide symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying abscess.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
