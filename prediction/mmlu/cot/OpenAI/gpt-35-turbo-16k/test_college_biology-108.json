    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Marine birds drink seawater, which is hypertonic to their tissues. To maintain their tissue osmolarity at a constant level, they need to get rid of excess salts and maintain water balance. Option A, where marine birds absorb water from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of dilute urine in the kidneys, does not address the issue of excess salts. Option B, where marine birds absorb salts from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of concentrated urine in the kidneys, does not explain how they maintain water balance. Option D, where marine birds excrete salts and nitrogenous wastes through specialized nasal glands, is not a known physiological strategy for maintaining tissue osmolarity. The best explanation is option C, where marine birds excrete salts through specialized salt-exchange glands and excrete small volumes of urine. This strategy allows them to get rid of excess salts while conserving water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
