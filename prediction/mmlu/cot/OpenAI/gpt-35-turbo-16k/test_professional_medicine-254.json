    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a Bartholin gland abscess. Bartholin gland abscesses are typically caused by obstruction of the Bartholin gland duct, leading to infection and subsequent abscess formation. The presentation of a tender, fluctuant mass in the labia, along with pain and swelling, is consistent with this diagnosis. The next step in management is to perform incision and drainage of the abscess. This procedure involves making a small incision in the abscess to allow for drainage of pus and relieve symptoms. Antibiotics alone are not sufficient for treatment of a Bartholin gland abscess, as the primary treatment is drainage. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration may be considered in cases where the abscess is small and easily accessible, but incision and drainage is generally preferred. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is D. Incision and drainage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
