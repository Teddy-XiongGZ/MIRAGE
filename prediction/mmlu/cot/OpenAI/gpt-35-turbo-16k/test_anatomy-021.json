    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The intercostal nerves are located between the ribs and are responsible for providing sensory innervation to the intercostal muscles and the skin of the thorax. To determine the location of the corresponding intercostal nerve in relation to the rib, we need to consider the anatomy of the intercostal space. Each intercostal space is bounded superiorly by the rib above and inferiorly by the rib below. The intercostal nerve runs along the inferior border of the rib in the intercostal space. Therefore, the corresponding intercostal nerve lies deep to the inferior border of the rib.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
