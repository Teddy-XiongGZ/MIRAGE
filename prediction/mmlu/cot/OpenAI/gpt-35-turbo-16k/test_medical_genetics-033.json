    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cross between the true breeding lines with dark blue and bright white flowers suggests that the parents have different alleles for the flower color gene. The F1 offspring being light blue indicates that there is some blending of the parental traits. When the F1 progeny are selfed, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed, which is consistent with the Mendelian inheritance pattern of a single gene with two alleles. This pattern is known as incomplete dominance, where the heterozygous genotype (light blue) exhibits an intermediate phenotype between the two homozygous genotypes (dark blue and white).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
