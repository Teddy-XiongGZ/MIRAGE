    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 65-year-old man with quadriplegia as a result of multiple sclerosis who is hospitalized for left lower lobe pneumonia. He appears malnourished and has a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum. The skin lesion is likely a pressure ulcer due to prolonged immobility. The most effective intervention for pressure ulcers is frequent turning, which helps relieve pressure on the affected area and promotes blood flow. Wet to dry dressings are not recommended for pressure ulcers as they can cause trauma to the wound bed.

Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is not indicated for the treatment of pressure ulcers unless there is evidence of infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
