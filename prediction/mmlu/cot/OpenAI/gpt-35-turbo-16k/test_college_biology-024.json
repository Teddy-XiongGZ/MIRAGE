    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mobile regions of DNA capable of inserting themselves into an existing genome are called transposons. \\n\\n1. Prions are not mobile regions of DNA. They are misfolded proteins that can cause diseases.\\n2. Cistrons are not mobile regions of DNA either. They are segments of DNA that code for a specific protein.\\n3. Introns are non-coding regions of DNA that are transcribed into RNA but are removed during RNA processing. They are not capable of inserting themselves into an existing genome.\\n4. Transposons, on the other hand, are mobile genetic elements that can move from one location to another within a genome. They can disrupt genes or cause changes in gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
