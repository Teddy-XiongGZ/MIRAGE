    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spastic paraplegia is a neurological condition characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness in the legs. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a different condition that can cause similar symptoms, but it is not specifically associated with spastic paraplegia. Therefore, option A is not true.\\n\\nB. Proprioceptive loss refers to the loss of the sense of position and movement of the body. While it can occur in some cases of spastic paraplegia, it is not a common feature. Therefore, option B is not true.\\n\\nC. Coordination in the legs is affected in spastic paraplegia due to the weakness and stiffness. This can lead to difficulties in walking and performing fine motor tasks. Therefore, option C is true.\\n\\nD. Spastic paraplegia is characterized by increased muscle tone, resulting in stiffness and spasticity. The tone is not normal or flaccid. Therefore, option D is not true.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is option C. Coordination in the legs is affected in spastic paraplegia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
