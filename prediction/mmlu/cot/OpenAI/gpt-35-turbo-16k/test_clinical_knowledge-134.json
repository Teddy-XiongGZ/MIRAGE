    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's analyze each option one by one: A. The knee is a ball and socket joint: This statement is incorrect. The knee joint is a hinge joint, allowing flexion and extension, but it does not have the range of motion of a ball and socket joint. B. A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee: This statement is incorrect. A baker's cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, is a fluid-filled swelling that typically occurs in the posterior aspect of the knee, not anterior. C. The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion: This statement is correct. The patellar tap test is a physical examination technique used to assess for the presence of fluid in the knee joint. A positive patellar tap indicates the presence of an effusion. D. 'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum: This statement is incorrect. 'Knock knee' deformity, also known as genu valgum, is characterized by an inward angulation of the knees. It is the opposite of bilateral genu varum, which is commonly known as 'bowlegged' deformity. Based on the analysis, the correct statement about the knee joint is C. The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
