This is because the mange mite is a fatal parasite that can cause significant harm to the foxes, potentially leading to their death.

This is because the foxes are the main predators of hares in this scenario, and with fewer foxes, the hares will face less predation pressure and their populations can thrive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
