    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A palpable left parasternal impulse suggests an abnormality in the left side of the heart. Let's go through the options: \\n\\nA. Right ventricular hypertrophy: This abnormality would typically cause a palpable impulse on the right side of the sternum, not the left side. \\n\\nB. Aortic stenosis: Aortic stenosis is characterized by a systolic ejection murmur and a delayed carotid upstroke, but it does not typically cause a palpable impulse. \\n\\nC. Aortic regurgitation: Aortic regurgitation is characterized by a diastolic murmur and a wide pulse pressure, but it also does not typically cause a palpable impulse. \\n\\nD. Left ventricular hypertrophy: This abnormality can cause a palpable impulse on the left side of the sternum due to the enlarged left ventricle pushing against the chest wall. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Left ventricular hypertrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
