    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During muscle contraction, the myosin heads bind to actin filaments and undergo a power stroke, which causes the actin filaments to slide past the myosin filaments, resulting in sarcomere shortening. This power stroke is fueled by the energy released from ATP hydrolysis. However, there are other processes in muscle contraction that also require ATP. One of these processes is the detachment of myosin from actin. After the power stroke, ATP binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from actin. This ATP-dependent detachment allows the myosin head to reset and prepare for another cycle of binding and power stroke. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Myosin-actin detachment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
