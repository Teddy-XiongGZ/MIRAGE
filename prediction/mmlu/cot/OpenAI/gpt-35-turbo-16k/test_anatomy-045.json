    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The viscerocranium refers to the bones of the face. The development of bones can occur through two main processes: endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification. Endochondral ossification involves the replacement of a cartilage model with bone, while intramembranous ossification involves the direct formation of bone from mesenchymal cells. The growth pattern of bones can either follow the somatic growth pattern, which means they grow in proportion to the rest of the body, or the neural growth pattern, which means they grow in response to the growth of the brain and neural structures. In the case of the viscerocranium, the bones develop initially through intramembranous ossification. This means that the mesenchymal cells directly differentiate into bone without the intermediate step of cartilage formation. However, the growth pattern of the viscerocranium bones follows the somatic growth pattern, as they grow in proportion to the rest of the body. Therefore, the correct answer is C. intramembranous ossification and follow the somatic growth pattern.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
