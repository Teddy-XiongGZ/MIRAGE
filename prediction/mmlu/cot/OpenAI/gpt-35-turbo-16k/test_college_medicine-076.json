    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes the release of acetylcholine (A) which traverses the neuromuscular junction. This is known as synaptic transmission. Acetylcholine then binds to acetylcholine receptors on the muscle membrane, leading to the opening of ion channels and the generation of a muscle action potential.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
