    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old boy who presents with breast enlargement. This is known as gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is a common finding during puberty and is usually due to normal development. In this patient, the physical examination findings are consistent with pubertal gynecomastia, as there are bilateral fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex. The normal penis and testes, as well as the Tanner stage 3 pubic hair development, further support the diagnosis of pubertal gynecomastia. The serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges, ruling out hormonal abnormalities. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement is normal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
