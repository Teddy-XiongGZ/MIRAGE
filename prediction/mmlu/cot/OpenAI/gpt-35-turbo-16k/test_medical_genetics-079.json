    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. It is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, which leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus in the body. This mucus can block the airways and ducts, leading to various complications. To determine which of the given options is not a recognized complication of cystic fibrosis, we need to consider the known complications of the condition. A. Cancer of the oesophagus: Cystic fibrosis does not directly increase the risk of developing cancer of the esophagus. This option could be a recognized complication of cystic fibrosis. B. Congenital absence of the vas deferens: This is a recognized complication of cystic fibrosis. Due to the thick mucus, the vas deferens, which carries sperm from the testes to the urethra, may be absent or blocked in males with cystic fibrosis. C. Diabetes mellitus: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a well-known complication of cystic fibrosis. The thick mucus can affect the function of the pancreas, leading to impaired insulin production and diabetes. D. Liver cirrhosis: Cystic fibrosis can cause liver disease, including liver cirrhosis. This option could be a recognized complication of cystic fibrosis. Based on the above analysis, the answer is A. Cancer of the oesophagus is not a recognized complication of cystic fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
