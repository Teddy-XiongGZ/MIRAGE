    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with pain, swelling, and erythema at the site of trauma, along with a fever. These findings are consistent with cellulitis, which is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. In cellulitis, the primary mechanism of edema development is the disruption of vascular basement membranes. This disruption allows fluid and inflammatory cells to leak out of the blood vessels and into the surrounding tissues, leading to edema. Increased hydrostatic pressure, release of thromboxane, and separation of endothelial junctions are not the primary mechanisms involved in the development of edema in cellulitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
