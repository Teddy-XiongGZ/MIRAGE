    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During intermittent high intensity exercise, the body requires energy to fuel the muscles. This energy is primarily derived from glucose stored in the muscles and liver. As exercise intensity increases, the body's demand for glucose also increases. During the initial stages of exercise, the body primarily relies on stored glycogen for energy. However, as glycogen stores become depleted, the body starts to break down glucose from the bloodstream to meet the energy demands. Considering the given options, we can eliminate option D (falls to hypoglycaemic levels) as it is unlikely for blood glucose levels to drop to dangerously low levels during high intensity exercise. Option A (frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM) is a possibility as the body may release additional glucose into the bloodstream to meet the energy demands. However, this rise may not be significant during the specific time frame of 80-90 minutes. Option B (remains relatively unchanged) is a possibility as well. If the body is able to efficiently utilize glucose from the bloodstream and maintain a steady supply of energy from glycogen stores, blood glucose levels may not fluctuate significantly during this time frame. Option C (frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM) is also a possibility. As the body utilizes glucose for energy, blood glucose levels may decrease slightly during high intensity exercise. Considering the given information, the most likely answer is either option B (remains relatively unchanged) or option C (frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM). However, without additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact change in blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/C\"}"
