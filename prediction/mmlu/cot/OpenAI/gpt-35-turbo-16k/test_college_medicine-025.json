    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the result of the original DNA sequence experiencing both a point mutation and a deletion, we need to understand the effects of each type of mutation. A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide base pair. In this case, the original DNA sequence is 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019. A deletion is the removal of one or more nucleotide base pairs from the DNA sequence. So, to determine the result of both a point mutation and a deletion, we need to identify which nucleotide base pair has been changed and which nucleotide base pair has been deleted. Looking at the potential choices: A. 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019 - This choice has a point mutation where the second nucleotide base pair has changed from G to C, but there is no deletion. B. 5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019 - This choice has a point mutation where the first nucleotide base pair has changed from G to T, and there is a deletion of the second nucleotide base pair. C. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019 - This choice has a point mutation where the fourth nucleotide base pair has changed from A to T, but there is no deletion. D. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019 - This choice has a point mutation where the seventh nucleotide base pair has changed from T to A, but there is no deletion. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is B. 5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019 which has both a point mutation and a deletion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
