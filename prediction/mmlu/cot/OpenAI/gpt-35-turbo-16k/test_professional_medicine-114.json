    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means it is carried on the X chromosome. Since the father had classic hemophilia, he must have had the disorder on his X chromosome. The karyotype of the fetus shows that it is XY, which means it has one X chromosome from the mother and one Y chromosome from the father. Since the father only has one X chromosome and it carries the hemophilia gene, there is a 50% chance that the fetus will inherit the X chromosome with the hemophilia gene. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
