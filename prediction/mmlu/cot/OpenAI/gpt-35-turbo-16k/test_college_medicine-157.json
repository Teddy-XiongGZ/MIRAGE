    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an example of the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Symbolic culture refers to the transmission of knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors through symbols, such as language, rituals, and traditions. Option I describes a young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean from an older monkey, even when the food is not covered in dirt or sand. This can be considered an example of social learning, where knowledge is transmitted from one individual to another through observation and imitation. It does not involve symbolic culture as there are no symbols or rituals involved. Option II describes a child learning the rules of baseball from a parent. This is an example of the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Baseball has its own set of rules and symbols, such as the use of specific gestures, signals, and terminology. The parent is passing on this knowledge to the child through symbolic communication. Option III describes a new group of inductees in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals from older students, which they then later carry out on new recruits. This is also an example of the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Hazing rituals in military organizations are symbolic acts that convey certain meanings and values. The older students are passing on these rituals to the new recruits, who then continue the tradition with future recruits. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is D. II and III only, as option I does not involve the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
