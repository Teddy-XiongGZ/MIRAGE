    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a lump on her neck, which is suspicious for a thyroid nodule. The physical examination reveals a 2-cm freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid. The most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is to perform an imaging study to evaluate the characteristics of the nodule. This will help determine if further evaluation or intervention is necessary. Options A and B (nuclear thyroid scan and iodine131 scan) are not the most appropriate initial methods for investigating a thyroid nodule. These scans are typically used to evaluate thyroid function and are not specific for evaluating nodules. Option C (fine-needle aspiration) is a diagnostic procedure that can be used to obtain a sample of cells from the nodule for further evaluation. However, it is not the most appropriate initial method for investigating the lesion. Option D (ultrasonography of the thyroid gland) is the most appropriate initial method for investigating a thyroid nodule. Ultrasonography can provide information about the size, location, and characteristics of the nodule, which can help guide further management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
