    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements. She has a history of intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. On examination, there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. The stool is brown and test for occult blood is negative. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of diverticulitis, which is inflammation or infection of the diverticula in the colon. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease. Pelvic ultrasonography is not the most appropriate choice as it is not specific for diverticulitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is used to evaluate the biliary and pancreatic ducts and is not indicated in this patient. Testing the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin is not indicated as the patient does not have risk factors for C. difficile infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast, which can help confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis and assess for complications such as abscess or perforation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
