    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic metabolism refers to the generation of ATP in the absence of available oxygen. This means that it occurs when there is not enough oxygen available for aerobic metabolism to take place. Anaerobic metabolism can occur in various tissues and cells, such as during intense exercise when oxygen demand exceeds supply. It involves the breakdown of glucose or glycogen through a process called glycolysis, which produces ATP and lactic acid as byproducts. Therefore, the correct answer is D. in the absence of available oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
