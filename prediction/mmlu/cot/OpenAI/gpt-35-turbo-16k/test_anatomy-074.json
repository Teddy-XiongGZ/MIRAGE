    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Medially directed strabismus refers to the inward deviation of one eye. This suggests that the affected eye is unable to move laterally (outward). The lateral movement of the eye is controlled by the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Damage to the abducens nerve would result in the inability to abduct the eye, leading to a medially directed strabismus. Therefore, the correct answer is D. abducens nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
