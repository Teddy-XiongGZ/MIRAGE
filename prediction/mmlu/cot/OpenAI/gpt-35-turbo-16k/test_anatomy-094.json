    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During a right lateral excursion of the mandible, the mandible moves to the right side. To achieve this movement, the muscles responsible for lateral excursion of the mandible need to contract. The primary muscle involved in lateral excursion of the mandible is the lateral pterygoid muscle. The lateral pterygoid muscle is located on both sides of the mandible and is responsible for moving the mandible laterally. Therefore, the most active muscle during a right lateral excursion of the mandible would be the right lateral pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
