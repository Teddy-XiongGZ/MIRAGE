    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder characterized by dwarfism. It is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. To determine the effect of the mutation, we need to consider the function of the normal FGFR3 gene. FGFR3 is a receptor involved in the regulation of bone growth. The mutation in achondroplasia leads to a constitutively active form of the FGFR3 receptor, resulting in excessive inhibition of bone growth. This means that the mutation causes a gain-of-function effect, as it leads to an abnormal and excessive function of the FGFR3 receptor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
