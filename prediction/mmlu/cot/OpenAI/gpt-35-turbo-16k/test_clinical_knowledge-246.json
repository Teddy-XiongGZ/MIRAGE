    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Low intake of carbohydrates in the diet can have various effects on exercise performance. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. The statement suggests that low carbohydrate intake does not influence exercise performance in events lasting less than 10 minutes. This may or may not be true, as the duration of exercise is not the only factor to consider when evaluating the impact of carbohydrate intake on performance.\\n\\nB. The statement suggests that low carbohydrate intake affects resting muscle pH. This is not a direct effect of low carbohydrate intake, as resting muscle pH is primarily influenced by other factors such as metabolic waste products and respiratory function.\\n\\nC. The statement suggests that low carbohydrate intake may impair high intensity exercise performance. This is true, as carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for high intensity exercise. In the absence of sufficient carbohydrates, the body may struggle to maintain optimal performance during high intensity activities.\\n\\nD. The statement suggests that low carbohydrate intake results in greater reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise. This is also true, as when carbohydrate intake is limited, the body relies more on stored glycogen in the muscles for energy during exercise.\\n\\nConsidering the above explanations, the most accurate answer is C. may impair high intensity exercise performance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
