    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During intermittent high intensity exercise, the body requires energy to fuel the muscles. This energy is primarily derived from glucose stored in the muscles and liver. As exercise intensity increases, the body's demand for glucose also increases. During the initial stages of exercise, the body primarily relies on stored glycogen for energy. However, as glycogen stores become depleted, the body starts to break down glucose from the bloodstream to meet the energy demands. Considering the given options, we can eliminate option D (falls to hypoglycaemic levels) as it is unlikely for blood glucose levels to drop to dangerously low levels during high intensity exercise. Option A (frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM) is a possibility as the body may release additional glucose into the bloodstream to meet the energy demands. However, this rise may not be significant enough to be considered as the most accurate answer. Option C (frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM) is also a possibility as the body utilizes glucose from the bloodstream to meet the energy demands. This decrease in blood glucose levels is expected during high intensity exercise. Option B (remains relatively unchanged) is less likely as the body's demand for glucose increases during high intensity exercise, and it is unlikely that blood glucose levels would remain stable. Based on the above reasoning, the most accurate answer would be option C. Blood glucose concentration frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
