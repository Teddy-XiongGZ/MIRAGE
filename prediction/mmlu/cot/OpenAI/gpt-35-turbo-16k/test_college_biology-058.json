    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs, we need to consider the evolutionary timeline. Amphibians were the first group of vertebrates to colonize land, and they have lungs to support their respiration. Reptiles, which evolved from amphibians, also have lungs. Mammals, which evolved later, have lungs as well. Trematoda, on the other hand, are parasitic flatworms and do not have lungs. Therefore, the correct answer is A. amphibians.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
