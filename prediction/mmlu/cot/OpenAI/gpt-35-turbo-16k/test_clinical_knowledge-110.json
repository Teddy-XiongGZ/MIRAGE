    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The auscultatory gap refers to a temporary disappearance of Korotkoff sounds during blood pressure measurement. It typically occurs between the systolic and diastolic phases. During the systolic phase, the cuff pressure is high enough to completely occlude the artery, resulting in no blood flow and no sound. As the cuff pressure is gradually released, the artery starts to open, and blood flow resumes, resulting in the reappearance of Korotkoff sounds. Therefore, the correct answer is B. when the Korotkoff sounds can be heard between systolic and diastolic phases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
