    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the main reason for the rapid improvement in women's world record performances, we need to consider each option and evaluate its likelihood. A. women have evolved a greater muscle mass: While it is true that muscle mass can contribute to athletic performance, it is unlikely that women have evolved a greater muscle mass in recent years. Evolution occurs over much longer time periods and is not specific to a certain gender or generation. B. women can now run faster than men: This option is not supported by scientific evidence. Men generally have faster running times compared to women in most athletic events. C. women have started training at an earlier age: This option is plausible. If women have started training at an earlier age, they would have more time to develop their skills and improve their performances. D. more women are now engaged in sport: This option is also plausible. If more women are participating in sports, there would be a larger pool of talented athletes, increasing the likelihood of record-breaking performances. Considering the options, it is more likely that the rapid improvement in women's world record performances is mainly due to either women starting training at an earlier age or more women being engaged in sport. Therefore, the answer choice is either C. women have started training at an earlier age or D. more women are now engaged in sport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C/D\"}"
