    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The quantum number l represents the azimuthal quantum number, which determines the shape of the orbital. For l = 2, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number (ml) are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. Each ml value corresponds to an orbital within the l = 2 shell. Each orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons (one with spin up and one with spin down) according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore, for l = 2, there are a total of 5 orbitals, and the maximum number of electrons that can occupy these orbitals is 5 x 2 = 10.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
