    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given information, the patient experienced trauma to the right knee while playing football. The lack of fluid motion and foot drop on the right suggest a neurological deficit. The negative standing flexion test and intact cruciate and collateral knee ligaments indicate that the knee joint itself is not the primary issue. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a neurological injury affecting the common peroneal nerve, which can result in foot drop.
