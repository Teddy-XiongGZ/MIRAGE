    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"\u03b4\u03b2-thalassaemia is a type of thalassemia that involves mutations in the delta-beta globin gene cluster. To determine the mutational mechanism in \u03b4\u03b2-thalassaemia, we need to consider the types of mutations that can occur. A deletion involves the removal of a segment of DNA, which would result in the loss of genetic material. A duplication involves the replication of a segment of DNA, resulting in an extra copy of genetic material. An insertion involves the addition of extra genetic material into the DNA sequence. A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide base pair. Based on this information, the most likely mutational mechanism in \u03b4\u03b2-thalassaemia is a point mutation, as it involves a change in a single nucleotide base pair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
