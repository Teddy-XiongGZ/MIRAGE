    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrogen ions are formed when pyruvate is converted to lactate during anaerobic glycolysis. This process occurs when there is a lack of oxygen and the body needs to produce ATP quickly. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, and under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to lactate, releasing hydrogen ions in the process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
