    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport in plants involves the use of proton pumps. Proton pumps are membrane proteins that use ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to transport protons (H+) across the cell membrane. This creates a proton gradient, which is used to drive the active transport of sugars into the phloem. Therefore, the correct answer is C. It requires ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
