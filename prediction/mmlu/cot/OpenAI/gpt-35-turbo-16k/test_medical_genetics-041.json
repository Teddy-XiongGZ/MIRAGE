    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) can be calculated using the formula q = sqrt(p), where p is the frequency of the dominant allele. Since the disorder is X-linked recessive, the frequency of affected males (q^2) can be calculated using the formula q^2 = 1/100. To find the frequency of the recessive allele (q), we take the square root of 1/100, which is 1/10. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1 - q = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10. The expected incidence of affected homozygous females (q^2) can be calculated using the formula q^2 = (1/10)^2 = 1/100. Therefore, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females would be 1 in 100.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
