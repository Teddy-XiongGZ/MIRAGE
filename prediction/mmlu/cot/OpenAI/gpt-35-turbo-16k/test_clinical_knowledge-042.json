    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is true in ulna nerve palsy, let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. The ulna nerve can be affected by a fracture of the spiral groove of the humerus: The ulna nerve runs in the ulnar groove of the humerus, not the spiral groove. Therefore, option A is not true.\\n\\nB. It gives rise to a positive phalen's sign: Phalen's sign is used to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome, not ulna nerve palsy. Therefore, option B is not true.\\n\\nC. It leads to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand: This is true. Ulna nerve palsy can result in sensory loss over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\\n\\nD. It supplies the biceps muscles: The ulna nerve does not supply the biceps muscles. The biceps muscles are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. Therefore, option D is not true.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. It leads to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
