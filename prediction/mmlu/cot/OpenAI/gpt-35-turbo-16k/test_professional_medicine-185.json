Ascertainment bias occurs when there is a systematic difference in the way that cases and controls are identified or diagnosed. In this study, the comparison group consists of shipyard workers who were not diagnosed with mesothelioma. By ensuring that both cases and controls had chest x-rays, the researchers can minimize the potential for ascertainment bias, as both groups are being evaluated for the outcome of interest using the same diagnostic method.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
