    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To synthesize an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template, we need to consider the enzymes and primers involved. Reverse transcription is the process of synthesizing a DNA strand from an RNA template. This process requires a primer, which can be either DNA or RNA, to initiate the synthesis. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of the DNA strand. Therefore, the correct answer is A. a DNA or RNA primer and reverse transcriptase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
