    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a deep soft tissue infection, most likely cellulitis or abscess formation. The presence of erythema, red streaks, fluctuance, and systemic symptoms such as fever and tachycardia suggest an infection that has spread beyond the skin. The most appropriate next step in management is incision and drainage of the abscess to relieve the pressure and allow for adequate drainage of the purulent material. Antibiotic therapy alone may not be sufficient to treat the infection, especially if there is an abscess present. Psychiatric consultation may be warranted given the patient's history of self-mutilation, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this acute setting. Topical silver sulfadiazine is used for burn wound care, but it is not indicated for the treatment of deep soft tissue infections. Transfer to a burn center may be considered if the patient has extensive burns or if there are concerns about the ability to manage the infection at the current facility, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
