    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During maximal dynamic exercise, the body primarily relies on anaerobic metabolism for energy production. This is because anaerobic metabolism can produce energy quickly without the need for oxygen. However, as the duration of exercise increases, the body gradually shifts towards aerobic metabolism, which utilizes oxygen to produce energy. This shift occurs because anaerobic metabolism is not sustainable for long periods of time. To determine when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic, we need to consider the time at which the body's energy demands can no longer be met solely by anaerobic metabolism. Option A: 10 seconds - This is a relatively short duration of time and is unlikely to be the point at which maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic. Option B: 30 seconds - This is a longer duration of time compared to 10 seconds, but it is still relatively short. It is possible that the shift towards predominantly aerobic metabolism may start around this time, but it is not the most likely answer. Option C: 1 minute - This is a longer duration of time compared to 30 seconds. It is more likely that the shift towards predominantly aerobic metabolism occurs around this time, as the body's energy demands increase and anaerobic metabolism becomes less sustainable. Option D: 4 minutes - This is a significantly longer duration of time compared to the previous options. It is highly likely that by this point, maximal dynamic exercise has become predominantly aerobic, as the body's energy demands cannot be met solely by anaerobic metabolism for such an extended period. Based on this reasoning, the most likely answer is Option D: 4 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
