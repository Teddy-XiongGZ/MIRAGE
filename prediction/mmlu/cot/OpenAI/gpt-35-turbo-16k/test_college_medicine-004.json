    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the rate of acceleration, we can use the equation of motion: v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the distance. Rearranging the equation, we have a = (v^2 - u^2) / (2s). Given that the initial velocity u is 0 m/s (since the car starts from rest), the final velocity v is 130 km/h (which can be converted to m/s), and the distance s is 50 m, we can substitute these values into the equation to find the acceleration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 26 m/s^2\"}"
