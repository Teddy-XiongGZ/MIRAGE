    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After translation, protein structure can be modified through various processes. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Lipidation: This process involves the attachment of lipid molecules to proteins. It can occur after translation and is known to modify protein structure.\\n\\nB. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds: This process is called elongation and occurs during translation itself. It does not occur after translation.\\n\\nC. Glycosylation: This process involves the attachment of sugar molecules to proteins. It can occur after translation and is known to modify protein structure.\\n\\nD. Phosphorylation: This process involves the addition of phosphate groups to proteins. It can occur after translation and is known to modify protein structure.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds, as this process occurs during translation and not after translation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
