    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In an actively photosynthesizing plant, the highest rate of oxygen production is expected in the tissue that is directly involved in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis primarily occurs in the mesophyll cells of the plant's leaves. The palisade mesophyll is a layer of elongated cells located just below the upper epidermis of the leaf. These cells contain a high concentration of chloroplasts, which are responsible for carrying out photosynthesis. Therefore, the palisade mesophyll would have the highest rate of oxygen production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
