    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's go through each statement and determine if it is true or false regarding the function of neurons. A. Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire. This statement is true. After an action potential, the neuron undergoes a refractory period during which it is less likely to fire another action potential. B. The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential. This statement is true. During the depolarization phase of an action potential, sodium ions flow into the neuron, causing the membrane potential to become more positive. C. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites. This statement is false. Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals of the transmitting neuron, not from its dendrites. D. An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential. This statement is true. The axon hillock is the region of the neuron where action potentials are initiated, and it must reach the threshold potential for an action potential to occur. Based on the above analysis, the statement that is NOT true regarding the function of neurons is C. The transmitting neuron does not secrete neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
