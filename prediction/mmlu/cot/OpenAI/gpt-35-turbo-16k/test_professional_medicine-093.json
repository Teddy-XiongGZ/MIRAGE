    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks. She has hypertension treated with enalapril, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors like enalapril block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. One of the side effects of ACE inhibitors is an increase in bradykinin levels. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator and can cause cough by stimulating sensory nerve endings in the airways. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough is increased serum bradykinin concentrations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
