    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mycorrhizal fungi are symbiotic fungi that form mutualistic associations with the roots of most plant species. They provide several benefits to plants. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. They protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats: While mycorrhizal fungi can help plants tolerate drought stress to some extent, their main role is not to protect plant roots from desiccation.\\n\\nB. They fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats: Mycorrhizal fungi do not fix nitrogen. This process is carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\\n\\nC. They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils: This is correct. Mycorrhizal fungi have a symbiotic relationship with plants, where they enhance the plant's ability to absorb phosphorus from the soil, which is often limited in availability.\\n\\nD. They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen: Mycorrhizal fungi do not provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen. This process is more commonly associated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
