    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation with a 'blank stare,' flat facial expression, rigidity, and catatonia is suggestive of a drug-induced state. The fact that he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician during the examination further supports this. Among the given options, the drug most commonly associated with these symptoms is PCP (phencyclidine). PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause a range of symptoms including altered mental status, catatonia, aggression, and hostility. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that typically causes sedation and relaxation, not aggression. Methamphetamine is a stimulant that can cause agitation and aggression, but it is less likely to cause the catatonic state described. Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic that can cause sedation and respiratory depression, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. PCP (phencyclidine)\"}"
