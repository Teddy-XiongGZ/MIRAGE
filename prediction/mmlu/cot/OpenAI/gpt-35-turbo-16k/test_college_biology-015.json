    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte causes the release of proteolytic enzymes. This suggests that the described events involve a reaction that prevents polyspermy. The zona reaction is the hardening of the zona pellucida, the outer layer of the egg, to prevent additional sperm from entering. The acrosomal reaction is the release of enzymes from the sperm's acrosome to penetrate the egg. The cortical reaction is the release of cortical granules from the egg to form a fertilization envelope, which prevents polyspermy. The fertilization reaction is not a recognized term in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is C. cortical reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
