    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stress can have various effects on the immune system. One of the main effects of stress is the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which leads to the release of cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone that has immunosuppressive effects. Therefore, if stress is adversely affecting the immune system, we would expect to see a change in cortisol levels. Option A suggests a decreased AM serum cortisol concentration, which aligns with the hypothesis. On the other hand, options B, C, and D do not directly relate to the effects of stress on the immune system. Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding to support the hypothesis is option A: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
