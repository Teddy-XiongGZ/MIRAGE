    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Embryonic cleavage refers to the series of rapid mitotic divisions that occur in the early stages of embryonic development. Let's evaluate each statement to determine which one is NOT true. \\n\\nA. The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage: This statement is true. The presence of a large amount of yolk can inhibit or slow down cleavage because yolk is not easily divided during cell division.\\n\\nB. Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage: This statement is true. Telolecithal eggs, which have a large amount of yolk concentrated at one end, undergo meroblastic cleavage where only a portion of the egg cytoplasm undergoes division.\\n\\nC. The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole: This statement is NOT true. In most cases, the animal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the vegetal pole. The animal pole contains less yolk and is more active in cell division.\\n\\nD. The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres: This statement is true. The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres, which are the individual cells formed during cleavage. \\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the statement that is NOT true is C. The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
