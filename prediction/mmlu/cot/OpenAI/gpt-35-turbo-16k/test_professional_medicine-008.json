    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most common route of metastasis for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic drainage of the tongue involves multiple lymph nodes, including the submental, submandibular, superior deep cervical, and inferior deep cervical lymph nodes.
