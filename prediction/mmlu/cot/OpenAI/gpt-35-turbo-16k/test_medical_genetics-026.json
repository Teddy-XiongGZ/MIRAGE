    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that is caused by abnormalities on chromosome 15. It is typically associated with the loss of function of the UBE3A gene. Now let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Maternal UPD 15: This refers to uniparental disomy, where both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the mother. This can result in Angelman syndrome as the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome 15 is typically silenced in neurons.\\n\\nB. Paternal UPD 15: This refers to uniparental disomy, where both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father. This would not result in Angelman syndrome as the UBE3A gene on the paternal chromosome 15 is typically not expressed in neurons.\\n\\nC. Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15: This refers to a deletion of a portion of the paternal chromosome 15. This can result in Angelman syndrome as the UBE3A gene on the paternal chromosome 15 is typically not expressed in neurons.\\n\\nD. A mutation in the SNRPN promoter: This would not result in Angelman syndrome as it does not directly affect the UBE3A gene. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Maternal UPD 15.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
