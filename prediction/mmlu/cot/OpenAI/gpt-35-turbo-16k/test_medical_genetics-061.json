    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which finding on prenatal ultrasound examination would not raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality, we need to consider the association of each finding with chromosome abnormalities. \\n\\nA. Duodenal atresia: Duodenal atresia is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and other chromosome abnormalities. Therefore, it would raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\\n\\nB. Holoprosencephaly: Holoprosencephaly is associated with chromosomal abnormalities, particularly trisomy 13. Therefore, it would raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\\n\\nC. Hydrops fetalis: Hydrops fetalis is a condition characterized by abnormal fluid accumulation in the fetus, and it can be caused by various factors including chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, it would raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\\n\\nD. Monozygotic twins: Monozygotic twins, also known as identical twins, occur when a single fertilized egg splits into two embryos. This is not directly associated with chromosome abnormalities. Therefore, it would not raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the answer is D. Monozygotic twins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
