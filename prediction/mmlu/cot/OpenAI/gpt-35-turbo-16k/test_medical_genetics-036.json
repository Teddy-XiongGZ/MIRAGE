    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anticipation refers to the phenomenon where the severity or age of onset of a genetic disorder tends to increase in successive generations. It is commonly observed in disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Huntington disease: This disorder is caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene. It shows anticipation, with earlier onset and more severe symptoms in successive generations. \\n\\nB. Marfan syndrome: This disorder is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene and does not typically show anticipation.\\n\\nC. Cystic fibrosis: This disorder is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and does not typically show anticipation.\\n\\nD. Fragile X syndrome: This disorder is caused by an expansion of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. It shows anticipation, with increasing severity and earlier onset in successive generations.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Huntington disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
