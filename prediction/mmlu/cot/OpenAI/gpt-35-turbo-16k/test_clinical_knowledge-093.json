    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's evaluate each statement one by one to determine which one is not true.\\n\\nA. Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate. This statement is true. Muscle glycogen is broken down by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce glucose-1-phosphate.\\n\\nB. Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibers in their leg muscles. This statement is also true. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers that are more resistant to fatigue and are commonly found in endurance athletes.\\n\\nC. Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration. This statement is true. The liver plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels by releasing glucose from glycogen stores when needed.\\n\\nD. Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body. This statement is not true. While insulin does promote glucose uptake by many tissues, there are some tissues, such as the brain and red blood cells, that do not require insulin for glucose uptake.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
