    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat, along with tenderness over the left maxillary sinus. These findings are consistent with sinusitis. Sinusitis is commonly caused by obstruction of the sinus ostia, leading to impaired drainage and subsequent infection. The most likely underlying mechanism in this patient is mucosal edema, which can obstruct the sinus ostia and impair sinus drainage. Eustachian tube dysfunction is more commonly associated with middle ear infections. Nasal polyps can also cause sinus obstruction, but there are no findings to suggest their presence in this patient. Oral contraceptive use is not a known cause of sinusitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
