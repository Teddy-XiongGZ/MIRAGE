    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of asthma. He presents with increased symptoms of wheezing and chest tightness, requiring the use of his albuterol inhaler one to two times daily. Physical examination reveals scattered rhonchi and wheezes. The peak expiratory flow rate is 240 L/min, which is below the expected range for his age and height. Given the persistent symptoms and decreased peak flow rate, the most appropriate management would be to initiate a daily corticosteroid inhaler (Option D). This is recommended for patients with persistent asthma symptoms and reduced lung function. Chest x-ray (Option A) is not indicated in this patient as there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of an underlying lung pathology. Fexofenadine therapy (Option B) is an antihistamine used for allergic rhinitis, but it would not be the first-line treatment for asthma. Increased use of the albuterol inhaler (Option C) may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but it does not address the underlying inflammation and is not recommended as a long-term management strategy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
