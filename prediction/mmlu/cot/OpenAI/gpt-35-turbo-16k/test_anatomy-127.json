    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The vital centres in the brainstem are responsible for controlling essential functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. To determine where these vital centres are located, we need to consider the different regions of the brainstem. The brainstem consists of three main parts: the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. The cerebellum, on the other hand, is not part of the brainstem and is primarily involved in motor coordination. Therefore, we can eliminate option D (cerebellum) as a potential choice. Now, let's focus on the remaining options. The midbrain is primarily involved in relaying sensory information and controlling eye movements, so it is unlikely to be the location of the vital centres. The pons is involved in relaying information between the cerebrum and cerebellum, but it does not house the vital centres. Finally, the medulla oblongata is the most likely location for the vital centres in the brainstem. It is responsible for controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. Therefore, the answer is C. medulla oblongata.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
