    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon typically occurs in the fallopian tube. The fallopian tube is the structure that connects the ovary to the uterus. After ovulation, the released egg travels through the fallopian tube where it can be fertilized by a spermatozoon. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina and does not play a direct role in fertilization. The ovary is the site of egg production but fertilization does not occur within the ovary. The uterus is the organ where a fertilized egg implants and develops into a fetus, but fertilization itself does not occur in the uterus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fallopian tube\"}"
