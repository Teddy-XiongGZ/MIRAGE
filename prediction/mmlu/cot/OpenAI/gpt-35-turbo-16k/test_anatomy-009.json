    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary motor cortex is responsible for initiating voluntary movements. It sends signals to the muscles to contract and produce movement. The primary motor cortex is organized in a somatotopic manner, meaning that different areas of the cortex control different parts of the body. When the primary motor cortex is activated, it typically results in the contraction of muscles on the opposite side of the body, known as contralateral limb musculature. Therefore, the correct answer is D. contraction of contralateral limb musculature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
