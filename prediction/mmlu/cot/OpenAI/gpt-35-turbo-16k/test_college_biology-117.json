    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The net primary productivity (NPP) in terrestrial ecosystems is the amount of energy that is captured by plants through photosynthesis and is available for consumption by other organisms. To determine why NPP tends to increase toward the tropics, we need to consider the factors that influence plant growth and photosynthesis in these regions. A. The higher species diversity in the tropics may contribute to increased plant growth as different species can occupy different niches and utilize resources more efficiently. However, this alone may not be the best explanation for the increase in NPP toward the tropics. B. Lower metabolic costs to plant growth in the tropics could potentially contribute to increased NPP. However, this statement is not supported by evidence and is not a widely accepted explanation. C. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics is a key factor that fosters photosynthesis. Water is essential for plant growth, and warm temperatures enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis. This explanation is supported by scientific evidence and is a widely accepted reason for the increase in NPP toward the tropics. D. The presence of more predators in the tropics that minimize herbivory may indirectly contribute to increased NPP by reducing the pressure on plants from herbivores. However, this explanation alone is not sufficient to explain the overall increase in NPP toward the tropics. Considering the above explanations, the best choice is C. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis, leading to an increase in net primary productivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
