    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retrotransposons are a type of transposable element that can move within the genome via an RNA intermediate. They are characterized by the reverse transcription of their RNA into DNA, which is then integrated back into the genome. This process allows retrotransposons to replicate and increase their copy number within the genome. Therefore, the correct answer is C. A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
