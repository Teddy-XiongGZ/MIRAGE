    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mapping of human chromosomes refers to the process of determining the location and order of genes on a chromosome. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. The mapping of human chromosomes is not restricted to the sex chromosomes. It involves mapping all the chromosomes in the human genome.\\n\\nB. This option suggests that mapping has been more successful as more DNA markers became available. This is a plausible explanation as the availability of more markers would provide more information for accurate mapping.\\n\\nC. The number of linkage groups refers to the number of sets of genes that are inherited together. It is not directly related to the number of chromosomes. Therefore, this option is not correct.\\n\\nD. Mapping of human chromosomes does not demonstrate that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes. Only a small portion of the DNA is involved in coding for genes, while the majority is non-coding DNA. Therefore, this option is not correct.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, option B seems to be the most accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
