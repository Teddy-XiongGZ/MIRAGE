    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we know that the small rodent species eats seeds from only one species of pine. This suggests that the rodents have a specialized diet. Additionally, it is mentioned that the litter size of these rodents is small compared to other small rodents. Given these facts, we can make some inferences. Option A, moderate sexual size dimorphism, refers to a difference in size between males and females of a species. There is no information provided that suggests this characteristic is likely for these rodents. Option B, high parental investment, refers to the amount of time and energy parents put into raising their offspring. Since the litter size is small, it is possible that the parents invest more time and energy into each individual offspring, making this a plausible characteristic for these rodents. Option C, precocial young, refers to offspring that are relatively mature and independent at birth. This characteristic is unlikely for these rodents since it is mentioned that the litter size is small and the young are most likely born in litters of two or three. Option D, frequent extrapair matings, refers to individuals of a species mating with multiple partners outside of their pair bond. There is no information provided that suggests this characteristic is likely for these rodents. Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the rodents exhibit high parental investment, as they have a small litter size and may invest more time and energy into each individual offspring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
