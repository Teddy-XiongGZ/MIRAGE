    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 5-year-old boy who has a habit of eating dirt since age 3. He has also complained of headaches recently. Physical examination reveals symmetrical nontender cervical adenopathy. Laboratory studies show normal serum zinc, lead, and iron concentrations, but serologic testing confirms toxoplasmosis. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to prescribe pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine therapy for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. The habit of eating dirt is likely related to the infection. There is no indication for prescribing fluoxetine, methylphenidate, or risperidone as these medications are used for psychiatric conditions, which are not the primary concern in this case. Referring the patient to a child psychiatrist is also not necessary at this point.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
