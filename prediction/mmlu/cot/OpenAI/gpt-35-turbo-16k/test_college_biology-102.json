    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The stabilization of the unique coiled structure of an alpha helix in a protein is primarily attributed to hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms. The alpha helix is formed by a repeating pattern of hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen of one amino acid and the amide hydrogen of the amino acid four residues down the chain. This hydrogen bonding stabilizes the helical structure and allows for the formation of a stable protein conformation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
