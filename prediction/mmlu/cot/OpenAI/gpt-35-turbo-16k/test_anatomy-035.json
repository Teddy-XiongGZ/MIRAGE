    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The auditory tube, also known as the Eustachian tube, is a tube that connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx. It helps equalize pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere. The opening of the auditory tube is controlled by two muscles: the levator veli palatini and the tensor veli palatini. The levator veli palatini muscle opens the auditory tube during swallowing and yawning, while the tensor veli palatini muscle helps to close the tube to prevent the entry of fluids and pathogens. Therefore, the correct answer is A. connects the inner ear and nasopharynx.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
