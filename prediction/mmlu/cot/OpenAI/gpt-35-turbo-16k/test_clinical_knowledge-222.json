    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Haematemesis refers to the vomiting of blood. Let's go through each option to determine which one is true of haematemesis. \\n\\nA. A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features: This statement is true. In cases of haematemesis, a low blood pressure and a rapid heart rate are concerning signs that may indicate significant blood loss and potential hemodynamic instability.\\n\\nB. A pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring: This statement is not necessarily true. Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker medication that can lower heart rate. However, in the context of haematemesis, a pulse rate of 80/min may still be concerning depending on the patient's baseline heart rate and the severity of the bleeding.\\n\\nC. Abdominal pain is always present: This statement is not true. While abdominal pain can be associated with haematemesis, it is not always present. The presence or absence of abdominal pain depends on the underlying cause of the bleeding.\\n\\nD. An alcohol history is not essential: This statement is not true. An alcohol history is important in cases of haematemesis as alcohol abuse can be a significant risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
