    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is found unconscious and has a positive urine toxicology screening for opiates and cocaine, indicating drug abuse. The examination findings of erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs suggest rhabdomyolysis, which is supported by the significantly elevated serum creatine kinase activity. The presence of pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes in the urine indicates myoglobinuria and hematuria, respectively. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the release of myoglobin into the circulation, which can cause renal vasoconstriction and direct tubular toxicity. Therefore, the patient is at increased risk for ATN over the next 24 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
