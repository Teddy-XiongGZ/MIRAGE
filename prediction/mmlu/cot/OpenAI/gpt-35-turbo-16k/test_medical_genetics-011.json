    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Normal adult haemoglobin (Hb A) consists of two \u03b1 (alpha) and two \u03b2 (beta) chains. The \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains are encoded by different genes and are synthesized separately. These chains come together to form a tetramer, with two \u03b1 chains and two \u03b2 chains. This tetramer structure is what gives Hb A its characteristic properties and function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
