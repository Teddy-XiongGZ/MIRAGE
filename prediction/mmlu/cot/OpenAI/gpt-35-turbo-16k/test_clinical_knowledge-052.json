    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The smallest increment on a sphygmomanometer refers to the smallest change in pressure that can be measured. A mercury sphygmomanometer uses a column of mercury to measure blood pressure, while an aneroid sphygmomanometer uses a mechanical pressure gauge. For a mercury sphygmomanometer, the smallest increment is typically 2 mmHg. This is because the column of mercury in the device is divided into small increments, and the smallest division is usually 2 mmHg. For an aneroid sphygmomanometer, the smallest increment can vary depending on the design and calibration of the device. However, it is commonly 2 mmHg as well. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 2 mmHg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
