    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of difficulty focusing, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and distractibility. These symptoms are suggestive of a manic episode. The patient's history of excessive alcohol use and illicit drug use in the past also raises the possibility of substance-induced mania. The absence of delusions or hallucinations and the intact memory and attention suggest that the patient does not meet criteria for a psychotic disorder. The absence of a history of psychiatric illness and the patient's good mood and organized thought process make bipolar disorder less likely. Antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder are characterized by longstanding patterns of maladaptive behavior and do not account for the acute onset of symptoms in this patient. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is substance-induced mood disorder, specifically substance-induced mania.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
