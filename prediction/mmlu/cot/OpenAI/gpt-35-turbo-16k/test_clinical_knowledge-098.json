    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ATP is the immediate source of energy for muscle contraction. It is stored in limited quantities in the muscle cells. During high intensity exercise, the demand for ATP increases. The ATP stored in the muscle can only supply energy for a short period of time before it is depleted. The duration for which the ATP store can supply energy depends on the intensity of the exercise. Higher intensity exercises require more ATP and therefore deplete the ATP store more quickly. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. 10 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
