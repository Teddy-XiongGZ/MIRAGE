    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the relative risk, we need to compare the risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X with the risk in individuals who do not take Drug X. First, let's calculate the risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X. Out of the 200 individuals who received Drug X, 100 individuals died of the particular type of cancer. So, the risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X is 100/200 = 0.5. Next, let's calculate the risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who do not take Drug X. Out of the 400 individuals who did not receive the drug, 100 individuals died of the same type of cancer. So, the risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who do not take Drug X is 100/400 = 0.25. Now, let's calculate the relative risk. The relative risk is the risk in individuals who take Drug X divided by the risk in individuals who do not take Drug X. So, the relative risk is 0.5/0.25 = 2. Therefore, the answer is D. Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer compared to individuals who do not take Drug X.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
