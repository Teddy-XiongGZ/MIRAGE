Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Decreased exploration when the mother is out of the room: This could be a normal reaction as the child may feel more secure and comfortable exploring when the mother is present.\\n\\nB. Crying and returning to the mother upon return: This could indicate a secure attachment as the child seeks comfort from the mother when she returns.\\n\\nC. Avoiding the mother upon return: This could be a concerning sign as it suggests the child is actively avoiding or rejecting the mother, which may indicate an insecure attachment.\\n\\nD. Exploring the room before the mother leaves: This behavior is not necessarily concerning as it could be a normal reaction of curiosity and exploration.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the concerning sign during this evaluation would be option C. Avoiding the mother upon return.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
