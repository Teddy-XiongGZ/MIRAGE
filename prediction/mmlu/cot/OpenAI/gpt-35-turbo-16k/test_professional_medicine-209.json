    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 31-year-old pregnant woman who presents with dyspnea, wheezing, tachycardia, coughing up bloodstreaked sputum, and decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. On cardiac examination, there is an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1. A diastolic, rumbling murmur with a distinct snapping sound precedes the murmur is audible at the apex. Fetal heart rate is normal. Given these findings, the most likely cause is mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation. Mitral stenosis is commonly caused by rheumatic heart disease, which is supported by the presence of a diastolic, rumbling murmur. The irregularly irregular rhythm and the loud S1 suggest the presence of atrial fibrillation, which is a common complication of mitral stenosis. The other options, chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease, coarctation of the aorta, and congenital aortic stenosis, do not explain the combination of findings seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
