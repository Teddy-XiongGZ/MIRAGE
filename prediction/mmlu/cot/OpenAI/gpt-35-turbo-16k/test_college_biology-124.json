    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A fixed action pattern is a sequence of behaviors that is triggered by a specific stimulus and is performed in a stereotypical manner. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. This option suggests that a fixed action pattern occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life. However, this is not accurate as a fixed action pattern can occur the first time an animal is exposed to the stimulus.\\n\\nB. This option states that a fixed action pattern occurs in the absence of sensory feedback. However, this is not correct as sensory feedback is usually involved in triggering and guiding the fixed action pattern.\\n\\nC. This option suggests that a fixed action pattern is a motor response that once released may be terminated spontaneously. This is not accurate as a fixed action pattern is typically a sequence of behaviors that is performed to completion once initiated, and it is not terminated spontaneously.\\n\\nD. This option states that a fixed action pattern is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment. This is the most accurate description of a fixed action pattern, as it is indeed triggered by specific sensory signals in the animal's environment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
