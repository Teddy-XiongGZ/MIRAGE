    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antibiotics that affect bacterial cells can interfere with various cellular processes. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Peptidoglycan synthesis: Antibiotics like penicillin and cephalosporins target peptidoglycan synthesis, which is a key component of bacterial cell walls. Therefore, antibiotics can interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis.\\n\\nB. Protein synthesis: Antibiotics like tetracyclines and macrolides can interfere with bacterial protein synthesis by targeting ribosomes. Therefore, antibiotics can interfere with protein synthesis.\\n\\nC. DNA synthesis: Antibiotics like fluoroquinolones can interfere with bacterial DNA synthesis by targeting DNA gyrase. Therefore, antibiotics can interfere with DNA synthesis.\\n\\nD. Reverse transcriptase: Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme found in retroviruses, not bacteria. Antibiotics do not target reverse transcriptase, so they do not interfere with this process.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Reverse transcriptase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
