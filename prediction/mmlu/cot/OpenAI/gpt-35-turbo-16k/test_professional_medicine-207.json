    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the body's demand for oxygen and nutrients increases, leading to various physiological changes. One of these changes is an increase in heart rate, which helps to deliver more oxygenated blood to the working muscles. In this case, the average pulse during the last 2 minutes of the exercise session is 175/min, indicating an elevated heart rate. Now, let's consider the options and determine which one is most likely to be decreased compared to the measurement before the session: A. Pulse pressure: Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. During exercise, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure typically increase due to increased cardiac output and peripheral resistance. Therefore, pulse pressure is not likely to be decreased. B. Stroke volume: Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each beat. During exercise, stroke volume usually increases to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, stroke volume is not likely to be decreased. C. Systolic blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts. During exercise, systolic blood pressure typically increases due to increased cardiac output and peripheral resistance. Therefore, systolic blood pressure is not likely to be decreased. D. Total peripheral resistance: Total peripheral resistance refers to the resistance to blood flow in the peripheral blood vessels. During exercise, total peripheral resistance usually decreases due to vasodilation in the working muscles, allowing for increased blood flow. Therefore, total peripheral resistance is the most likely to be decreased compared to the measurement before the session. Based on the above reasoning, the answer choice is D. Total peripheral resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
