    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During CPR, chest compressions should be delivered at a rate of 100/minute. The correct rate of chest compressions during CPR is important to ensure adequate blood flow to the vital organs. Here's why:\\n\\n1. Chest compressions are a crucial component of CPR as they help to manually pump blood to the heart and brain when the heart is not functioning properly.\\n2. The recommended rate of chest compressions is 100-120 compressions per minute.\\n3. This rate ensures that there is enough blood flow to maintain oxygenation and perfusion of the vital organs.\\n4. Compressing the chest at a rate of 100/minute allows for adequate time for the heart to refill with blood between compressions.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 100/minute.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
