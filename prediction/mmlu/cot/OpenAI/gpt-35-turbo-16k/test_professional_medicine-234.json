    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When considering the properties of a killed vaccine relative to a live vaccine, we need to evaluate the specific characteristics of the new severe respiratory illness caused by the newly identified virus. A. Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence: This property is important when the live vaccine has the potential to revert to a virulent form and cause disease. However, since the question does not provide any information about the potential for reversion to virulence, we cannot determine if this is the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness. B. Develops more rapid protective immunity: Live vaccines often provide more rapid protective immunity compared to killed vaccines. However, the question does not provide any information about the urgency of developing immunity, so we cannot determine if this is the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness. C. Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity: Killed vaccines generally require multiple doses and sometimes boosters to achieve and maintain lifelong immunity. Live vaccines, on the other hand, may provide long-lasting immunity with a single dose. Since the question does not provide any information about the need for subsequent boosters, we cannot determine if this is the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness. D. Is most likely to generate mucosal immunity: Mucosal immunity is important for respiratory illnesses as it provides protection at the site of entry. Live vaccines are more likely to generate mucosal immunity compared to killed vaccines. However, since the question does not provide any information about the importance of mucosal immunity for this illness, we cannot determine if this is the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness. Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot determine\"}"
