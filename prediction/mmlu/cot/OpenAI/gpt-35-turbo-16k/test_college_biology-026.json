    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why the genes that allow host bird species to be duped into rearing cuckoo fledglings remain in the gene pool of the population. To answer this, we need to consider the potential benefits and costs of this behavior. Option A suggests that the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry. This does not explain why the genes allowing the host birds to be duped would remain in the gene pool. Option B suggests that the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when it rears an interloper of another species. This could be a potential reason for the genes to remain in the gene pool, as the host bird's fitness is not negatively affected. Option C suggests that on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own. This does not explain why the genes allowing the host birds to be duped would remain in the gene pool. Option D suggests that the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced. This does not explain why the genes allowing the host birds to be duped would remain in the gene pool. Considering the potential benefits and costs, option B seems to be the most plausible explanation for why the genes that allow host bird species to be duped into rearing cuckoo fledglings remain in the gene pool of the population.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
