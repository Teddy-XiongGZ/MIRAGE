    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the energy expended, we need to use the formula: Energy (kJ) = Oxygen uptake (L/min) x Duration of exercise (min) x 5.0 kJ/L. Given that the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 L/min for 5 minutes of exercise, we can substitute these values into the formula: Energy (kJ) = 3.0 L/min x 5 min x 5.0 kJ/L = 75 kJ. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 150 kJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
