    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the experimental observation that would NOT be expected. The binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3 is necessary for the sperm's acrosomal reaction and fertilization. Therefore, any experimental observation that disrupts this binding or blocks the interaction between ZP3 and its receptors would be expected to inhibit fertilization. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization: This option is expected because the antibodies would bind to ZP3, preventing its interaction with the sperm's receptors.\\n\\nB. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization: This option is also expected because the purified ZP3 would bind to the sperm's receptors, preventing their interaction with ZP3 in the zona pellucida.\\n\\nC. Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization: This option is expected for the same reason as option A.\\n\\nD. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads: This option is NOT expected because if ZP2 is capable of binding to the sperm's receptors, it should still lead to sperm aggregation on the beads, similar to the binding of ZP3 to the zona pellucida. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
