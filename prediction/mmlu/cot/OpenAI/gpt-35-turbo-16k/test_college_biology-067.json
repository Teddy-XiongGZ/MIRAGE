    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis, is a process in which cells undergo a controlled and organized self-destruction. This process is important for the development and functioning of various tissues and organs. To determine which plant cell undergoes programmed cell death to become functional, we need to consider the characteristics and functions of the given cell types. A. Phloem sieve tube members are responsible for transporting sugars and other organic compounds in plants. They do not undergo programmed cell death to become functional. B. Xylem vessel members are involved in the transport of water and minerals in plants. They do not undergo programmed cell death to become functional. C. Stomatal guard cells are specialized cells that control the opening and closing of stomata, which are small pores on the surface of leaves. These cells undergo programmed cell death to become functional. When they undergo apoptosis, they create a gap between them, allowing the stomata to open and facilitate gas exchange. D. Root cap cells are located at the tip of plant roots and protect the growing root. They do not undergo programmed cell death to become functional. Based on the above information, the correct answer is C. Stomatal guard cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
