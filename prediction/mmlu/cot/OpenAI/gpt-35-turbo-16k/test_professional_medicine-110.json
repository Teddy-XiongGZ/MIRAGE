    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis for this 4-year-old boy is Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness that primarily affects children under the age of 5. It is characterized by fever lasting for at least 5 days, along with at least four of the following five clinical criteria: bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips or oral mucosa, changes in the extremities (edema, erythema, or desquamation), polymorphous rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The presence of anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis bilaterally, a strawberry tongue, an erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet in this patient strongly suggests Kawasaki disease. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of Kawasaki disease is intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). IVIG has been shown to reduce the risk of coronary artery abnormalities and other complications associated with Kawasaki disease. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Intravenous immune globulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
