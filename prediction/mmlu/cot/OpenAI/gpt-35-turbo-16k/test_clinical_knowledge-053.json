    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In head injury and altered conscious level, abnormal breathing patterns can occur due to damage to the brainstem. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a pattern of breathing characterized by alternating periods of deep, rapid breathing followed by periods of apnea. This can be seen in head injury. Anaerobic respiration refers to a type of cellular respiration that occurs in the absence of oxygen and is not directly related to altered conscious level. Hyperventilation is an abnormal increase in breathing rate and depth and can be seen in head injury. Ataxic breathing is an irregular, unpredictable breathing pattern and is also seen in head injury. Therefore, the answer is B. Anaerobic respiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
