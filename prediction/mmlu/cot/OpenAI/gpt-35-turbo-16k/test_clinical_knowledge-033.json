    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Let's analyze each option one by one.\\n\\nOption A: Calcitonin is a hormone that is released by the thyroid gland. Its primary function is to lower blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing renal excretion of calcium. Therefore, it does not cause a rise in plasma calcium. This option is incorrect.\\n\\nOption B: Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands. This leads to increased levels of calcium in the blood. While some individuals with primary hyperparathyroidism may be asymptomatic, many experience symptoms such as fatigue, bone pain, kidney stones, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nOption C: Vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands. It is actually synthesized in the skin when exposed to sunlight or obtained through dietary sources. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium metabolism by promoting the absorption of calcium from the intestines and regulating its levels in the blood. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nOption D: Oliguria refers to a decreased urine output. Hypercalcaemia, which is an elevated level of calcium in the blood, can lead to various symptoms including polyuria (increased urine output) rather than oliguria. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nStep 2: After analyzing each option, we can conclude that none of the options are true of calcium metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
