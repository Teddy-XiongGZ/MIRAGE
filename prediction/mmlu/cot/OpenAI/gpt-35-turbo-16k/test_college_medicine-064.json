    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the rate of energy expenditure, we can use the formula: Rate of energy expenditure = Rate of oxygen consumption x Energy equivalent of oxygen. The energy equivalent of oxygen is approximately 20 kJ/L. Therefore, the rate of energy expenditure is approximately 2 L/min x 20 kJ/L = 40 kJ/min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 40 kJ/min.\"}"
