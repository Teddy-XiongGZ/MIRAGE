    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The number of human protein-coding genes has been a topic of debate and research. Initially, it was estimated that there are around 100,000 human protein-coding genes. However, with advancements in genomic research and analysis, this estimate has been revised. Recent studies suggest that the number of human protein-coding genes is likely to be lower than initially thought. The most widely accepted estimate currently is in the range of 19,000\u201320,000 genes. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 19,000\u201320,000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
