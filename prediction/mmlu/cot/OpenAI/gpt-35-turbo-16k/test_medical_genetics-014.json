    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Monosomy refers to the presence of only one copy of a particular chromosome instead of the usual two copies. To determine which of the options is an example of monosomy, we need to identify the option that has only one copy of a specific chromosome. A. 46,XX: This option indicates a normal female karyotype with two X chromosomes. It does not represent monosomy. B. 47,XXX: This option indicates a female karyotype with an extra X chromosome. It does not represent monosomy. C. 69,XYY: This option indicates a male karyotype with an extra Y chromosome. It does not represent monosomy. D. 45,X: This option indicates a karyotype with only one X chromosome, which is known as Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is an example of monosomy, as it involves the absence of one X chromosome in females. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 45,X.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
