    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When recording peak flow results, the three readings should be within a certain range to ensure accuracy and consistency. The range is typically determined by the variability of an individual's peak flow measurements. To determine this range, it is important to establish the personal best peak flow measurement for the individual. This is usually the highest peak flow measurement achieved when the individual's asthma is well-controlled. Once the personal best is established, the range for subsequent peak flow measurements is typically calculated as a percentage of the personal best. The most commonly used range is 20% of the personal best. Therefore, the answer is B. 20 litres per minute of each other.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
