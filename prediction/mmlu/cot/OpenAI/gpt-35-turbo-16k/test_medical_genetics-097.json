    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify genetic variants (such as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) that are associated with a particular trait or disease. The question states that despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies, known SNPs explain a certain percentage of the variation in body mass index. This suggests that the known SNPs are not able to explain the full heritability of body mass index. Given the options provided, we need to choose the percentage that is less than 50%. Option A states that only 5% of the variation in body mass index is explained by known SNPs. This is less than 50% and could be a possible answer. Option B states that less than 1% of the variation in body mass index is explained by known SNPs. This is also less than 50% and could be a possible answer. Option C states that only 13% of the variation in body mass index is explained by known SNPs. This is greater than 50% and cannot be the correct answer. Option D states that less than 2% of the variation in body mass index is explained by known SNPs. This is also less than 50% and could be a possible answer. Based on the step-by-step thinking, the correct answer is either A or B, as they both state that the known SNPs explain less than 50% of the variation in body mass index. To make a definite choice, we need more information or context about the specific study or data being referred to. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine the exact percentage explained by known SNPs. Therefore, the answer choice is not definitive and cannot be determined from the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
