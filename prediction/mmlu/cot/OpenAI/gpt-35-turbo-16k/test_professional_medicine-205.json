    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 1-year-old male with blistered fresh burns over his hands and feet in a stocking and glove distribution. The history provided suggests that the burns were accidental. The next step in the management of this patient should focus on the immediate medical needs and ensuring the safety of the child. Given the severity of the burns, the most appropriate next step would be to administer pain management and initiate the necessary medical interventions, such as debridement of the burns and baseline laboratory studies. The option to contact child protective services may be considered if there are concerns about the circumstances surrounding the burn, but it should not be the immediate next step in the management of the patient. Discharging the patient home with his parents without providing appropriate medical care would not be appropriate. Administering a 5% albumin infusion or intravenous steroids are not indicated in the initial management of burns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
