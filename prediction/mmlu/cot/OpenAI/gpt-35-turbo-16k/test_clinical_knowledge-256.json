    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Male patients are advised to take their own electric razor to the hospital for a specific reason. Let's evaluate each option to determine the most appropriate answer. Option A, patient comfort, may be a consideration, but it is not the primary reason for advising male patients to bring their own electric razor. Option B, making the hospital as familiar as possible, is not directly related to the use of an electric razor. Option D, allowing shaving at a time convenient to the patient, is a valid consideration, but it is not the primary reason. Option C, minimizing the risk of cross-infection, is the most likely reason for advising male patients to bring their own electric razor. Sharing razors can increase the risk of transmitting infections, including skin infections and bloodborne pathogens. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
