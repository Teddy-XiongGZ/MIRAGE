    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To observe the integration of mouse and human cell-surface proteins along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane, a cell culture technique that allows for the fusion of two different cell types is required. This suggests that either producing a heterokaryon (A) or producing a hybrid cell (B) could be the correct answer. A heterokaryon is formed by fusing two different cells, resulting in a single cell with two distinct nuclei. A hybrid cell, on the other hand, is formed by fusing two different cells, resulting in a single cell with a single nucleus containing genetic material from both parent cells. Given that the question mentions the integration of proteins along a fused plasma membrane, it is more likely that producing a hybrid cell (B) was employed in this experiment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
