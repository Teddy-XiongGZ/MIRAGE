    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions. The activity of an enzyme can be influenced by various factors, including pH. pH affects the ionization state of amino acid residues in the enzyme and substrate. If the activity of an enzyme is constant over a broad range of pH values, it suggests that the ionization state of the enzyme is not critical for its activity. This means that ionizing groups on the enzyme may not be directly involved in the reaction. However, ionizing groups on the substrate could still participate in the reaction. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. only ionizing groups on the substrate participate in the reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
