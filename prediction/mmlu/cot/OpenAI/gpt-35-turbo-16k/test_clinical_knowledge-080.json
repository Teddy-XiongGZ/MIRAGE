First, patient consent should be obtained to ensure they understand the procedure and give their permission. This is important for ethical and legal reasons. Second, the patient should be washed to maintain hygiene and reduce the risk of infection. Third, it is important to check the expiry dates of any equipment or supplies that will be used during the procedure to ensure they are still valid and safe to use.
