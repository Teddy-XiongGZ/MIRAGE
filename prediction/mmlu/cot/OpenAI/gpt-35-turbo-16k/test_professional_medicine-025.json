    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, which suggests a respiratory condition. The absence of chest pain or palpitations makes cardiac causes less likely. The normal cardiopulmonary examination and chest x-ray further support a respiratory etiology. The spirometry results show a normal FEV1:FVC ratio and FEV1, ruling out obstructive lung diseases like asthma and chronic bronchitis. Gastroesophageal reflux disease typically presents with heartburn and regurgitation, which are not mentioned in the patient's history. Postnasal drip syndrome can cause cough and nasal congestion, especially when lying down, but it is less likely to be exercise-induced. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is postnasal drip syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
