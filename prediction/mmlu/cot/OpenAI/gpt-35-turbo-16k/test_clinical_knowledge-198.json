    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maximum sustainable power refers to the maximum amount of power that a person can sustain over a given period of time. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is correct. \\n\\nA. usually remains constant during a race: This option is unlikely to be correct because the maximum sustainable power can vary depending on factors such as fatigue and energy depletion. \\n\\nB. declines with the distance of the race: This option is more likely to be correct because as the distance of the race increases, the body's energy stores deplete, leading to a decline in the maximum sustainable power. \\n\\nC. is improved by a high fat diet: This option is unlikely to be correct because while a high fat diet may provide a sustained source of energy, it does not necessarily improve the maximum sustainable power. \\n\\nD. is inversely related to muscle glycogen content: This option is also unlikely to be correct because muscle glycogen is an important source of energy during exercise, and a higher muscle glycogen content is generally associated with better performance. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. declines with the distance of the race.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
