    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is transported into the muscle cell through a process called facilitated diffusion. This means that glucose moves across the cell membrane with the help of specific protein transporters. The main transporter responsible for glucose uptake in muscle cells is called GLUT4. Insulin plays a role in the regulation of GLUT4, but it is not required for glucose transport into the muscle cell. Hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates glucose once it enters the cell, but it is not involved in the actual transport of glucose across the cell membrane. Monocarboxylic acid transporters are responsible for the transport of monocarboxylic acids, not glucose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
