    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the location of the enlarged submandibular salivary gland, we need to consider its anatomical position and the possible causes of enlargement. The submandibular salivary gland is located beneath the mandible, in the submandibular triangle. It is responsible for producing saliva. Enlargement of the submandibular salivary gland can occur due to various reasons such as infection, inflammation, or obstruction of the salivary duct. If the gland is enlarged due to infection or inflammation, it is likely to be palpable extraorally. This means that the enlargement can be felt by touching the area outside the mouth, in the submandibular triangle. In such cases, the patient may experience pain or tenderness in the affected area. On the other hand, if the gland is enlarged due to obstruction of the salivary duct, it may not be palpable extraorally. In this case, the enlargement is usually located within the mouth, beneath the tongue. The patient may experience swelling or a lump in the floor of the mouth, near the sublingual gland. Based on this information, the most likely answer is C. The enlarged submandibular salivary gland can be palpable both intra- and extraorally, depending on the cause of enlargement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
