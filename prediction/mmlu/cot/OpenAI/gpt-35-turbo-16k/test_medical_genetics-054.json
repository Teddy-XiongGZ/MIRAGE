    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transcriptional activator proteins are proteins that play a role in gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences near a gene. They help in the initiation of transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase to the gene promoter region. This suggests that the correct answer is A. bind regions near a eukaryotic gene and allow an RNA polymerase to transcribe a gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
