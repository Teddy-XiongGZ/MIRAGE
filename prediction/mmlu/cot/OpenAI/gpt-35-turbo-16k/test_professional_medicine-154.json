    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. The next step in evaluation should be to determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the most appropriate initial step in evaluating a thyroid nodule. FNA allows for cytologic examination of the nodule, which can help differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. CT scan of the neck is not the first-line investigation for evaluating thyroid nodules. Radionuclide thyroid scan is used to evaluate thyroid function, not to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. Thyroidectomy is a treatment option for malignant nodules, but it is not the appropriate next step in evaluation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
