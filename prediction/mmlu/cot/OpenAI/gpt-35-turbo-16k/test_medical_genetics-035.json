    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genetic disorders such as alkaptonuria and albinism are caused by specific gene mutations. These mutations can be inherited in different ways. To determine which option explains these genetic disorders, we need to consider the mode of inheritance for each disorder. Alkaptonuria is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the disorder to be present. Albinism, on the other hand, can be inherited in different ways depending on the type. The most common type, oculocutaneous albinism, is also inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Recessive inheritance has.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
