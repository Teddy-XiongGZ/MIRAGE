    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is commonly used by geneticists to study the relatedness of animal populations for several reasons. Let's evaluate each option to determine the correct answer: A. mtDNA mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA: This statement is incorrect. In fact, mtDNA mutates at a faster rate than nuclear DNA due to the lack of DNA repair mechanisms in mitochondria. B. mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes: This statement is correct. Unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA is solely inherited from the mother and does not undergo recombination, making it useful for tracing maternal lineages and studying population genetics. C. There are few single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hypervariable, noncoding regions: This statement is incorrect. The hypervariable, noncoding regions of mtDNA are known for their high mutation rate and high variability, making them valuable for population studies. D. All mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes: This statement is incorrect. While mtDNA does encode some mitochondrial proteins, the majority of mitochondrial proteins are actually encoded by nuclear DNA and imported into the mitochondria. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
