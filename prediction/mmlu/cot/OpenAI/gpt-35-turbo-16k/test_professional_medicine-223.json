    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of acute onset of rotatory vertigo, imbalance, decreased hearing, tinnitus, a sense of fullness of the right ear, and vomiting suggest a peripheral cause of vertigo. The presence of mild hearing loss in the right ear further supports a peripheral etiology. Acoustic neuroma is a slow-growing tumor of the vestibular nerve and typically presents with gradual onset of symptoms, such as hearing loss and tinnitus. Benign positional vertigo is characterized by brief episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. Brain stem transient ischemic attacks typically present with symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, rather than the specific symptoms described by the patient. Meniere's disease is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, Meniere's disease is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Meniere's disease\"}"
