    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation of absent sensation over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin, as well as absent sensation over the right side of the tongue, the most likely cause is a fracture affecting the location of the nerve responsible for these sensory deficits. The nerve responsible for sensation over the face anterior to the right ear, along the mandible, and to the chin is the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3). The mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve exits the skull through the foramen ovale. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting the foramen ovale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Foramen ovale\"}"
