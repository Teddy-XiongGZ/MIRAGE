    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following: 1. The hormone is found both inside and outside of cells when carrying out its function. This suggests that it is able to cross cell membranes, which is a characteristic of steroid hormones. 2. The hormone increases the amount of nucleic acid in the cell while functioning. Steroid hormones are known to regulate gene expression, which involves the synthesis of nucleic acids. 3. The hormone is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. Steroid hormones are characterized by their four-ring structure. Based on these observations, the hormone described is most likely a steroid hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
