    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The paranasal sinuses are air-filled spaces within the bones of the skull that communicate with the nasal cavity. The middle meatus is a passage in the nasal cavity. To determine which sinuses open into the middle meatus, we need to consider the anatomy of the sinuses. The anterior ethmoidal sinuses are located in the ethmoid bone and open into the middle meatus. The frontal sinuses are located in the frontal bone and also open into the middle meatus. The maxillary sinuses are located in the maxillary bones and open into the middle meatus. The sphenoidal sinuses are located in the sphenoid bone, but they do not open into the middle meatus. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The anterior ethmoidal, frontal, and maxillary sinuses open into the middle meatus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
