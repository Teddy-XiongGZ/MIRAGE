    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with swelling of her legs and weight gain, which are suggestive of fluid retention. The physical examination findings of periorbital edema, bulging flanks, and pitting edema in the lower extremities further support this. The patient's medical history is significant for sickle cell trait and mild anemia, but these conditions are unlikely to cause the current presentation. The patient's use of ibuprofen, smoking, and alcohol consumption may contribute to renal dysfunction and fluid retention. The history of cocaine use is less likely to be related to the current presentation given the remote timing. Given the findings of fluid retention, the most likely abnormal study would be the urine protein concentration, as this would indicate renal involvement and proteinuria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
