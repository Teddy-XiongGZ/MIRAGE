    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The subclavian arteries are major blood vessels that supply blood to the upper limbs and parts of the head and neck. To determine which brain area is supplied by branches of the subclavian arteries, we need to consider the blood supply to the brain. The main arteries that supply blood to the brain are the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries. The internal carotid arteries supply blood to the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, which primarily supply the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain. The vertebral arteries, which arise from the subclavian arteries, supply blood to the posterior cerebral arteries, which primarily supply the occipital lobe and parts of the temporal lobe. Therefore, the brain area supplied by branches of the subclavian arteries is the occipital lobe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
