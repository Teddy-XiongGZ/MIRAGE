    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A keloid is a type of scar that forms as a result of an overgrowth of collagen in the skin during the healing process. It is characterized by the presence of a firm mass of scar tissue that extends beyond the boundaries of the original wound. Keloids are not evidence of infection, as they can occur even in the absence of infection. They are also not a fine, hairline scar, as they are typically raised and thickened. Lastly, keloids are not formed if a wound drain is removed too soon, as their formation is primarily related to an abnormal healing response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
