    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Keystone species are species that have a disproportionately large impact on their ecosystem relative to their abundance. They play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of the ecosystem. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. tend to reduce diversity by eliminating food resources for other species: This is not true. Keystone species actually promote diversity by creating and maintaining habitats that support a variety of other species.\\n\\nB. provide the foundation for food webs: This is true. Keystone species often occupy a critical position in the food web, and their presence or absence can have cascading effects on other species.\\n\\nC. are more abundant than most other species in their communities: This is not necessarily true. Keystone species can be abundant or rare, but their impact on the ecosystem is not solely determined by their abundance.\\n\\nD. can prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction: This is true. Keystone species can help maintain biodiversity by preventing dominant species from excluding less competitive species.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. provide the foundation for food webs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
