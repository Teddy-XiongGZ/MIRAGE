    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cellular uptake of cholesterol occurs through internalization of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol complexes. This process is known as receptor-mediated endocytosis. The low density lipoprotein-cholesterol complexes bind to cell-surface receptors, which triggers the formation of endosomes. The endosomes then transport the complexes into the cell. Adhesion plaques, on the other hand, are structures involved in cell adhesion and not directly related to cholesterol uptake. Therefore, the correct answer is B. adhesion plaques.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
