    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A sarcomere is the basic unit of a striated muscle and is responsible for muscle contraction. Let's evaluate each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. During contraction H zones become elongated: This statement is incorrect. During muscle contraction, the H zones actually shorten as the actin filaments slide over the myosin filaments.\\n\\nB. In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin: This statement is correct. In the relaxed position, tropomyosin covers the binding sites on actin, preventing myosin from binding.\\n\\nC. Each myosin helical tail contains an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site: This statement is incorrect. The myosin head contains the actin-binding site and the ATP-hydrolyzing site.\\n\\nD. The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively: This statement is incorrect. Troponin is associated with the thin filaments, while tropomyosin is also associated with the thin filaments and covers the binding sites on actin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
