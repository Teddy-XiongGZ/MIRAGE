    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The larvae are eating their way from the center of the twig towards the outside. The pith is located in the center of the twig, so the larvae would encounter the pith first. Next, they would encounter the secondary xylem, which is located outside the pith. After the secondary xylem, they would encounter the primary xylem, which is located outside the secondary xylem. The vascular cambium is located outside the primary xylem, so that would be the next tissue region the larvae would encounter. After the vascular cambium, they would encounter the secondary phloem, which is located outside the vascular cambium. Next, they would encounter the primary phloem, which is located outside the secondary phloem. Finally, they would encounter the cortex, which is the outermost tissue region of the twig.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
