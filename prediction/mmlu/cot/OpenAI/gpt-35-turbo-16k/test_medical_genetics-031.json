    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotypic frequencies can be calculated using the equation p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. Given that the frequency of allele A is 0.6 and the frequency of allele B is 0.4, we can substitute these values into the equation. Let's calculate the genotypic frequency of heterozygotes (2pq).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
