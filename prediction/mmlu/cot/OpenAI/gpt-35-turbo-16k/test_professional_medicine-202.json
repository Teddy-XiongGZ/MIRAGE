    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl with elevated blood pressure measurements on multiple occasions. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Her physical examination is unremarkable, and her laboratory tests, including urinalysis, are within normal limits. The next step in management should be to evaluate for secondary causes of hypertension. The most common cause of secondary hypertension in adolescents is renal parenchymal disease. Therefore, renal ultrasonography is an appropriate initial test to evaluate for renal abnormalities. If renal ultrasonography is normal, further evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension, such as measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations or urine corticosteroid concentrations, may be considered. However, in this case, renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, so the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate lifestyle modifications, including exercise and weight reduction program, as the patient is at the 95th percentile for weight. Pharmacologic therapy, such as captopril, is not indicated at this time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
