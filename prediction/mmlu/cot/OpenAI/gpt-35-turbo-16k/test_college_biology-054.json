    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Linkage disequilibrium refers to the non-random association of alleles at different loci. It can be influenced by various factors. Let's consider each option:\\n\\nA. Asexual reproduction: In asexual reproduction, there is no recombination of genetic material, which means that the alleles at different loci remain together and do not get shuffled. This can promote linkage disequilibrium.\\n\\nB. Coadapted gene complexes: Coadapted gene complexes refer to a set of genes that have evolved together and are beneficial when present together. If these genes are physically close to each other on the same chromosome, they are more likely to be inherited together, promoting linkage disequilibrium.\\n\\nC. Epistasis: Epistasis refers to the interaction between different genes, where the effect of one gene depends on the presence of another gene. If these interacting genes are physically close to each other on the same chromosome, they are more likely to be inherited together, promoting linkage disequilibrium.\\n\\nD. Random mating: Random mating refers to the absence of any preference for mating partners based on their genotype. It promotes genetic diversity and reduces the likelihood of alleles at different loci being inherited together, thus reducing linkage disequilibrium.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the factor that does NOT promote linkage disequilibrium is D. Random mating.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
