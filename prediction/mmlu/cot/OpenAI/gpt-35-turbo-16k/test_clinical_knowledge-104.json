    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are characterized by having an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to a central carbon atom. They also have a side chain or R-group that varies between different amino acids. Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamine are all amino acids.
