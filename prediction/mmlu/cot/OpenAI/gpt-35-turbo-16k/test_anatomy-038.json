    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bronchioles are the smaller airways in the respiratory system that branch off from the bronchi. They are responsible for delivering air to the alveoli. The walls of bronchioles do not contain cartilage, as cartilage is present in the larger airways such as the trachea and bronchi. However, bronchioles do contain smooth muscle, which allows for constriction and dilation of the airways. Additionally, the walls of bronchioles are lined with respiratory epithelium, which helps in the exchange of gases. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
