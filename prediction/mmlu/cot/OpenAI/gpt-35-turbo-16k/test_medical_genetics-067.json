    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-linked inheritance refers to the inheritance of a genetic disorder through the X chromosome. In this type of inheritance, the gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Therefore, X-linked disorders are typically more common in males. A. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Therefore, A is not the correct answer. B. Tay-Sachs disease is also an example of an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, which is located on chromosome 15. Therefore, B is not the correct answer. C. Haemophilia A is an X-linked disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the F8 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Therefore, C is not the correct answer. D. Haemophilia B is also an X-linked disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the F9 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Therefore, D is not the correct answer. Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is E. None of the above. None of the disorders listed in the options do not show X-linked inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"E\"}"
