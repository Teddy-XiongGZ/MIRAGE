    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Positional cloning refers to the process of mapping a gene to a specific chromosomal region and then identifying and cloning a genomic copy of the gene from that region. This technique is used to identify and clone genes associated with specific traits or diseases. It involves several steps, including mapping the gene to a chromosomal region using genetic markers, narrowing down the region through linkage analysis, and finally identifying and cloning the gene from the region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
