    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Trinucleotide repeat expansion is a genetic mutation where a sequence of three nucleotides is repeated multiple times. This mutation is known to cause certain genetic disorders. Let's go through the options:\\n\\nA. Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which is not associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion.\\n\\nB. Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which is not associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion.\\n\\nC. Huntington disease: Huntington disease is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion of the CAG sequence in the HTT gene. This expansion leads to the production of an abnormal protein that causes neurodegeneration.\\n\\nD. Osteogenesis imperfecta: Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which are not associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion.\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is C. Huntington disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
