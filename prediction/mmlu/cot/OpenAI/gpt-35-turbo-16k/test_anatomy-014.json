    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct statement about the growth of the mandible, let's evaluate each option one by one:\\n\\nA. The mental symphysis refers to the midline fusion of the two halves of the mandible. It does not close at 1 year postnatally, as it continues to grow and fuse until adulthood. This statement is incorrect.\\n\\nB. The condylar growth cartilage is responsible for the growth of the mandible. It ceases activity at the end of adolescence, not necessarily at puberty. This statement is partially correct.\\n\\nC. The ossification center refers to the initial site of bone formation. It appears around 8 weeks intrauterine life (I.U.L) medial to Meckel's cartilage, which is a precursor to the mandible. This statement is correct.\\n\\nD. The functional matrix refers to the forces and influences acting on bone growth. The lateral pterygoid muscle is not directly involved in the growth of the angle of the mandible. This statement is incorrect.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the correct statement about the growth of the mandible is C. The ossification centre appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
