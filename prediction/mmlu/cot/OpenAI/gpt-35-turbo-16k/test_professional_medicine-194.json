    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-month-old girl who presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that has continued despite administration of rectal diazepam. After receiving an additional dose of diazepam intravenously, the seizure terminates. However, within 2 minutes, her oxygen saturation drops to 75% and she appears cyanotic. Respirations are 10/min and shallow. This suggests that the patient is experiencing respiratory insufficiency. Given the history and presentation, the most likely underlying cause of the respiratory insufficiency is medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can cause respiratory depression, especially when given in high doses or in combination with other sedating medications. The patient's respiratory insufficiency occurred shortly after receiving the second dose of diazepam, which supports this hypothesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
