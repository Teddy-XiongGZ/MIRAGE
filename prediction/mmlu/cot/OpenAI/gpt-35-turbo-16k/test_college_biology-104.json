    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A prokaryote that is thermophilic and methanogenic and has isoprenylglycerol ethers in its membrane instead of phospholipids is most likely an archaeon. Thermophilic organisms are adapted to live in high-temperature environments, and methanogenic organisms produce methane as a metabolic byproduct. Isoprenylglycerol ethers are a characteristic feature of archaeal membranes, whereas phospholipids are found in the membranes of bacteria and eukaryotes. Therefore, the correct answer is D. an archaeon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
