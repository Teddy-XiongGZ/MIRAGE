    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype through changes in the sequence of nucleotides. This can lead to changes in the structure and function of the protein encoded by the gene. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. A different polypeptide is produced: This option is correct because mutations can alter the sequence of nucleotides in a gene, leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide produced. This can result in a different protein with altered structure and function.\\n\\nB. The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA: This option is incorrect because mutations in DNA do not directly affect the polarity of tRNA.\\n\\nC. Nucleic acids are methylated: This option is incorrect because methylation of nucleic acids is a separate process that can regulate gene expression, but it does not directly result in the expression of a new phenotype.\\n\\nD. The gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction: This option is incorrect because the direction of gene reading (transcription) is always from 5' to 3' on the DNA template strand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
