This can result in various symptoms, including pupil abnormalities. Option A, unilateral constricted pupil, is not typically associated with a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy. Option B, bilateral constricted pupils, is not specific to a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy and can be seen in other conditions such as opioid overdose. Option D, oval shaped pupils, is not a characteristic finding of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy. However, option C, unilateral fixed dilated pupil, is a classic sign of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy and is considered a neurosurgical emergency. This is because it can indicate compression of the nerve due to an expanding intracranial mass, such as an aneurysm or tumor. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Unilateral fixed dilated pupil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
