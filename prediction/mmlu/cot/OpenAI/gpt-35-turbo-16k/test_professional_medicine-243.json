    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient is at high risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) due to his age, recent surgery, and history of coronary artery disease. The most appropriate prophylaxis for DVT in this patient would be pharmacologic prophylaxis. Options B, C, and D are all pharmacologic options. Option A, continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices, is a non-pharmacologic option and may be used as an adjunct to pharmacologic prophylaxis but is not the most beneficial option on its own. Warfarin (option C) is an oral anticoagulant that requires monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) and has a delayed onset of action. It is not the most beneficial option for immediate postoperative prophylaxis. Heparin (option B) is an intravenous anticoagulant that requires monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). While it is an effective option, it requires continuous intravenous infusion and monitoring, which may not be practical in this patient. Enoxaparin (option D) is a low molecular weight heparin that can be given subcutaneously once or twice daily without the need for monitoring. It is the most beneficial option for immediate postoperative prophylaxis in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
