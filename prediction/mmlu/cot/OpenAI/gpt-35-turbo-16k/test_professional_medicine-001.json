    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 25-year-old female in active labor at 39 weeks' gestation. She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. The examination shows no reason for obstructed labor, the fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is hypotonic uterine dysfunction. This is characterized by weak or ineffective contractions that fail to progress labor. Braxton Hicks contractions are usually irregular and do not cause cervical dilation. Lower uterine retraction ring is a finding seen in prolonged labor. Primary dysfunctional labor is a diagnosis of exclusion and requires ruling out other causes of labor dystocia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. hypotonic uterine dysfunction\"}"
