    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle, we need to consider the role of each option. \\n\\nA. Adrenaline: Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone that primarily acts to increase heart rate and blood pressure. It does not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. \\n\\nB. Insulin: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. It promotes glucose uptake by muscle cells and stimulates protein synthesis, thereby promoting amino acid uptake by muscle. \\n\\nC. Glycogen: Glycogen is a stored form of glucose in the body. It does not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. \\n\\nD. Cortisol: Cortisol is a stress hormone that has various effects on the body, including increasing blood sugar levels. However, it does not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is B. Insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
