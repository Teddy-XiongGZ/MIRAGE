    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"\u03b1-thalassaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin. It is caused by mutations in the genes that code for the alpha globin chains of hemoglobin. The common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a deletion of one or more of the alpha globin genes. This deletion leads to a decrease in the production of alpha globin chains, resulting in an imbalance with the beta globin chains and ultimately causing the symptoms of \u03b1-thalassaemia. Therefore, the answer is A. a deletion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
