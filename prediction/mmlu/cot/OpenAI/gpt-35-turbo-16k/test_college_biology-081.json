    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences, we need a technique that can detect the presence of the protein-DNA complex. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Western blot hybridization: This technique is used to detect specific proteins in a sample, but it does not directly demonstrate protein binding to DNA sequences.\\n\\nB. Northern blot hybridization: This technique is used to detect specific RNA molecules, not protein-DNA interactions.\\n\\nC. Southern blot hybridization: This technique is specifically designed to detect DNA sequences. It involves the transfer of DNA fragments from a gel to a membrane, followed by hybridization with a labeled DNA probe. This technique can be used to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences.\\n\\nD. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay: This technique is commonly used to study protein-DNA interactions. It involves the separation of protein-DNA complexes from unbound DNA fragments using gel electrophoresis. The presence of shifted bands indicates protein binding to specific DNA sequences. Therefore, this technique can also be used to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, both C (Southern blot hybridization) and D (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay) can be used to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C and D\"}"
