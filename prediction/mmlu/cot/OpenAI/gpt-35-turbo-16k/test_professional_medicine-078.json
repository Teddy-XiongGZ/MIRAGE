    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the sensitivity of a test, we need to know the number of true positive results (i.e., the number of individuals with the condition who test positive). In this case, the condition of interest is prostate cancer. The question states that 90 out of the 100 men who underwent biopsy procedures were found to have prostate cancer. Therefore, the number of men with prostate cancer who tested positive is 90. Hence, the answer is not A, B, or C. Option D, prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL, is not necessary to calculate the sensitivity of the test. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
