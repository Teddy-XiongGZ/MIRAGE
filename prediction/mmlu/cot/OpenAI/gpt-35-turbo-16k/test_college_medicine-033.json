    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy charge of the cell refers to the extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool is phosphorylated. Adenine nucleotides, such as ATP and ADP, play a crucial role in energy metabolism within the cell. When ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, energy is released and the adenine nucleotide pool becomes less phosphorylated. Conversely, when ADP is phosphorylated back to ATP, energy is stored and the adenine nucleotide pool becomes more phosphorylated. Therefore, the energy charge of the cell is determined by the balance between the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of adenine nucleotides.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
