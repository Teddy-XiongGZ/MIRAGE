    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, decreased urine output, and a decrease in hematocrit. These findings suggest hypovolemia. The reported operative blood loss of 200 mL is unlikely to account for the significant decrease in blood pressure. The clear drainage from the nasogastric tube suggests that there is no active bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Given the location of the surgery (left hemicolectomy at the splenic flexure), damage to the spleen is the most likely cause of these findings. The spleen is a highly vascular organ, and injury to it can result in significant blood loss and hypovolemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
