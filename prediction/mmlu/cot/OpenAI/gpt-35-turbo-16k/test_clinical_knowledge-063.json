    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Systemic Sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin and connective tissues. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. It affects males more than females: This statement is incorrect. Systemic Sclerosis affects females more frequently than males, with a female to male ratio of about 3:1.\\n\\nB. If telangiectasia are seen this clinches the diagnosis: This statement is incorrect. While telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels) can be seen in Systemic Sclerosis, their presence alone is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Additional clinical and laboratory findings are required.\\n\\nC. Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease: This statement is incorrect. Arachnodactyly, which refers to abnormally long and slender fingers, is not a characteristic feature of Systemic Sclerosis. It is more commonly associated with Marfan syndrome.\\n\\nD. Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin: This statement is incorrect. A beaked shaped nose and waxy skin are not typical findings in Systemic Sclerosis. These features are more commonly seen in conditions such as scleromyxedema or lipodermatosclerosis.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, none of the options provided are true of Systemic Sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
