The presence of erythema of the vulva and vagina, along with a thick white vaginal discharge, suggests an infection. The pH of the discharge is 4, which is consistent with a normal vaginal pH. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a fishy odor and a pH greater than 4. Chlamydia trachomatis infection is often asymptomatic in women, but when symptoms occur, they typically include vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, and dysuria. Escherichia coli infection is a common cause of urinary tract infections, but it typically presents with lower urinary tract symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency.
