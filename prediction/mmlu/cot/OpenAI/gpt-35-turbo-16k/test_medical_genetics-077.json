    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Female pseudohermaphroditism refers to a condition where an individual with female external genitalia has internal reproductive organs that are not fully developed or are ambiguous. It is important to note that female pseudohermaphroditism can have various causes. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Androgen insensitivity: Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition where individuals with XY chromosomes have impaired response to androgens, resulting in incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia. This condition does not cause female pseudohermaphroditism.\\n\\nB. Campomelic dysplasia: Campomelic dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects skeletal development. It is not associated with female pseudohermaphroditism.\\n\\nC. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): CAH is a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands' ability to produce certain hormones. In some cases of CAH, excessive androgen production can lead to virilization of female external genitalia, causing female pseudohermaphroditism.\\n\\nD. Klinefelter syndrome: Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (XXY). While individuals with Klinefelter syndrome may have some degree of feminization, it does not typically cause female pseudohermaphroditism.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is C. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
