    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RNA is a type of nucleic acid that is involved in protein synthesis. It is composed of a chain of nucleotides, which are made up of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The four nitrogenous bases found in RNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Thymine (T) is a nitrogenous base that is found in DNA, but not in RNA. Therefore, the nucleotide base that is not found in RNA is thymine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
