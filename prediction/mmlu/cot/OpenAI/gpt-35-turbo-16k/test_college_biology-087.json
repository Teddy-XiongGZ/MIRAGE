    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sexual dimorphism refers to the differences in physical characteristics between males and females of a species. In primates, a high degree of sexual dimorphism is often associated with competition between individuals of the same sex for limited resources or mates. Since the question asks about competition between primates, we can eliminate options A and C, which involve competition for individual food resources. This leaves us with options B and D, which involve competition for mates. Among primates, it is generally the males who compete for mates, as they often engage in behaviors such as fighting or displaying to attract females. Therefore, the correct answer is B. males in order to obtain mates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
