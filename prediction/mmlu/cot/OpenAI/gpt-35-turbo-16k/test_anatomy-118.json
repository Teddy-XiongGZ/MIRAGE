    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The right atrioventricular valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. It prevents the backflow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium during ventricular contraction. Option A is incorrect because semilunar valves are located between the ventricles and the major arteries leaving the heart, not between the atria and ventricles. Option B is correct. The right atrioventricular valve is prevented from everting (flipping inside out) by papillary muscles. These muscles are attached to the valve leaflets via chordae tendineae, which help to keep the valve in the correct position during ventricular contraction. Option C is incorrect. The right atrioventricular valve is closed during systole (ventricular contraction) to prevent the backflow of blood. Option D is incorrect. The right atrioventricular valve prevents blood from flowing back into the right atrium from the right ventricle, not from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
