    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which biological attribute would most likely allow a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution, we need to consider the characteristics that would enable the species to colonize and thrive in various habitats across different regions. A. Extreme habitat specialization would limit the species to a specific type of habitat, making it less likely to be cosmopolitan in distribution. B. K-selected reproductive rate refers to species that have few offspring but invest heavily in each individual. While this strategy may increase the chances of survival for each offspring, it does not necessarily contribute to cosmopolitan distribution. C. Limited dispersal abilities would restrict the species' ability to move and colonize new areas, making it less likely to become cosmopolitan in distribution. D. Capacity for long-distance dispersal would allow the species to travel over long distances and colonize new habitats. This attribute increases the chances of the species becoming cosmopolitan in distribution. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Capacity for long-distance dispersal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
