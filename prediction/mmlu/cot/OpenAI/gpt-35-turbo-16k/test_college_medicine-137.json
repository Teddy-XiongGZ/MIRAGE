    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate occurs during glycolysis, which is the first step of cellular respiration. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. In this process, a small amount of ATP is produced through substrate-level phosphorylation. Specifically, for each molecule of glucose, two molecules of ATP are produced. Therefore, the net formation of ATP during the conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate is two molecules of ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
