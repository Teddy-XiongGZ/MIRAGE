    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The technician is trying to determine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA is present in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. They are using DNA purified from the leukocytes of the patient and reacting it with oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are performed, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. Based on these steps, the most likely laboratory procedure used by the technician is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PCR is a technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences, and it involves repetitive cycles of heating and cooling to denature and anneal DNA strands, followed by DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerase. Gel electrophoresis is then used to detect the amplified DNA product.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Polymerase chain reaction\"}"
