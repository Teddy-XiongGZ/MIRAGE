    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs after eating, and the location of the pain extending from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and sometimes felt in the right scapula, the most likely diagnosis is biliary colic. Biliary colic is caused by gallstones obstructing the cystic duct or common bile duct, leading to intermittent pain. The pain typically occurs after eating fatty meals and is not relieved by antacids. The next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis with imaging.

Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
