    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pupillary light reflex is a reflex that controls the constriction of the pupil in response to light. Let's go through each statement to determine which one is true. \\n\\nA. Its efferent limb is carried in the optic nerve: The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain, but it does not carry the efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex. \\n\\nB. It is mediated by the inferior colliculi in the midbrain: The inferior colliculi are involved in auditory processing, not the pupillary light reflex. \\n\\nC. It is a consensual reflex: The pupillary light reflex is indeed a consensual reflex, meaning that both eyes respond to light stimulation. When light is shone into one eye, both pupils constrict. \\n\\nD. Its afferent limb is carried in the oculomotor nerve: The afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is carried in the optic nerve, not the oculomotor nerve. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct statement is C. It is a consensual reflex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
