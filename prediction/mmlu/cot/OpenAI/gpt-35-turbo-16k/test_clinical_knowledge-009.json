    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatty acids need to be transported into the mitochondria in order to undergo beta-oxidation, which is the process of breaking down fatty acids for energy production. The first step in this process involves the activation of fatty acids by attaching them to coenzyme A (CoA) through the action of an enzyme called thiokinase. This forms a compound called fatty acyl-CoA. However, fatty acyl-CoA cannot directly enter the mitochondria. Instead, it needs to be transported across the mitochondrial membrane by a specific transporter. This transporter is called the carnitine shuttle, and it involves the transfer of the fatty acyl group from CoA to carnitine, forming acylcarnitine. Acylcarnitine can then be transported into the mitochondria. Once inside the mitochondria, the acylcarnitine is converted back to fatty acyl-CoA, which can then undergo beta-oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. carnitine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
