    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Codons are sequences of nucleotide bases that code for specific amino acids. They are found in mRNA or DNA. The question is asking about the composition of codons. To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the structure of codons and their role in protein synthesis. Codons consist of three nucleotide bases, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. These nucleotide bases can be adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T) in DNA, and adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or uracil (U) in RNA. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, which is the building block of proteins. Therefore, the correct answer is A. triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
