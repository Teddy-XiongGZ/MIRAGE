    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A frameshift mutation occurs when a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene. This causes a shift in the reading frame of the gene, altering the way the codons are read during translation. As a result, the entire sequence of amino acids encoded by the gene is changed. Telomeric sequences being removed from DNA (option A) does not cause a frameshift mutation. Option B describes a point mutation, where a single nucleotide in a codon is changed, leading to the production of a different amino acid. Option D describes a nonsense mutation, where a codon is changed to a stop codon, prematurely terminating translation. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
