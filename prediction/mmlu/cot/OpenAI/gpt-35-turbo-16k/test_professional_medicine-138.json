    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is condyloma acuminatum, which is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The lesions are typically flesh-colored, sessile, and turn white on application of acetic acid. The patient's sexual history and inconsistent condom use increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections. The most appropriate next step in management for condyloma acuminatum is cryotherapy, which involves freezing the lesions with liquid nitrogen. This is a commonly used treatment modality for genital warts and has a high success rate. Oral acyclovir therapy (choice A) is used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections, which typically present with painful vesicular lesions. Oral doxycycline therapy (choice B) is used for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and syphilis, but these conditions are less likely based on the clinical presentation. Intramuscular penicillin therapy (choice C) is used for the treatment of syphilis, which typically presents with painless genital ulcers and lymphadenopathy. However, the absence of these findings makes syphilis less likely. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is cryotherapy (choice D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
