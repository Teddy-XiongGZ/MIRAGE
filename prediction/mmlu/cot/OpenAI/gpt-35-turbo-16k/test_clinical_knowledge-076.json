    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. It is regulated by several factors. \\n\\nFirst, preload refers to the amount of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole, just before contraction. An increase in preload stretches the ventricular muscle fibers, leading to a more forceful contraction and increased stroke volume. Therefore, preload is one of the factors that regulate stroke volume.\\n\\nSecond, contractility refers to the strength of the ventricular contraction. An increase in contractility leads to a more forceful contraction and increased stroke volume. Therefore, contractility is another factor that regulates stroke volume.\\n\\nThird, afterload refers to the resistance that the ventricle must overcome to eject blood into the systemic circulation. An increase in afterload decreases stroke volume. Therefore, afterload is also one of the factors that regulate stroke volume.\\n\\nBased on these explanations, the correct answer is B. Preload, contractility, and afterload.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
