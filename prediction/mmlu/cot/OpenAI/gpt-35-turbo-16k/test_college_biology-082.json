    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To maintain adequate serum levels of calcium in humans, we need to identify the hormone responsible for calcium regulation. Thyroxine (choice A) is a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland and is not directly involved in calcium regulation. Glucagon (choice B) is a hormone secreted by the pancreas and is primarily involved in regulating blood glucose levels. Growth hormone (choice C) is secreted by the pituitary gland and is responsible for growth and development, but not calcium regulation. Parathyroid hormone (choice D) is secreted by the parathyroid glands and plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis. It acts to increase serum calcium levels by stimulating the release of calcium from bones, increasing calcium absorption in the intestines, and reducing calcium excretion in the kidneys. Therefore, the correct answer is D. parathyroid hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
