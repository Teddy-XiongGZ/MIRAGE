    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we can use Boyle's Law, which states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure, assuming constant temperature. Mathematically, this can be represented as P1V1 = P2V2, where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume. In this case, we know that the initial volume (V1) is 0.1L and the initial pressure (P1) is 200atm. The final pressure (P2) is given as 1atm. We can rearrange the equation to solve for V2: V2 = (P1 * V1) / P2. Plugging in the values, we get V2 = (200atm * 0.1L) / 1atm = 20L.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 20L\"}"
