    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From an evolutionary perspective, the optimality theory suggests that traits that provide a net benefit to the organism will persist in the genome. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. This option suggests that if the benefits gained from the trait exceed the cost of the trait to the animal performing them, that trait will persist in the genome. This aligns with the optimality theory as it considers the net benefit of the trait.\\n\\nB. This option suggests that if the trait reaps the best return for the cost relative to alternative forms of the trait, that trait will win out over the alternative forms. This also aligns with the optimality theory as it considers the cost-benefit ratio of the trait.\\n\\nC. This option suggests that beneficial traits are always worth the cost to the organism in energy and physiology, so those traits will persist in the genome. However, this statement is too absolute and does not consider the trade-offs and costs associated with the trait.\\n\\nD. This option suggests that the relative fitness of an organism must be improved due to a specific trait in order for the trait to remain in a population's gene pool. This aligns with the optimality theory as it considers the fitness advantage of the trait.\\n\\nConsidering the explanations above, options A and B both align with the optimality theory, but option B provides a more comprehensive explanation by considering the relative return on cost compared to alternative forms of the trait. Therefore, the answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
