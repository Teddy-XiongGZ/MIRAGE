It commonly presents with difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and muscle weakness. The hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the left upper extremity are not consistent with ALS. Friedreich ataxia is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system and causes progressive damage to the spinal cord. It typically presents with ataxia, muscle weakness, and loss of reflexes. Pick disease is a type of frontotemporal dementia characterized by progressive decline in behavior, language, and cognition. It does not typically present with motor symptoms. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a viral infection of the brain that primarily affects individuals with weakened immune systems. It does not typically present with motor symptoms. Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
