    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use and the complaint of feeling 'burning up,' it is important to consider infective endocarditis as a possible diagnosis. The presence of a systolic heart murmur over the precordium suggests valvular involvement. When evaluating a heart murmur, it is important to assess its intensity and any associated changes with different maneuvers. Option A, decreased intensity of S1, is not an expected finding in this scenario. Option B, increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration, is not a typical finding in infective endocarditis. Option C, increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration, is also not a typical finding. Option D, positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration), is not specific to infective endocarditis and is more commonly seen in conditions such as constrictive pericarditis or right-sided heart failure. Therefore, the expected physical finding in this scenario is not listed among the provided choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
