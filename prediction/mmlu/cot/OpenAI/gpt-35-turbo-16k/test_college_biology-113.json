    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At the maximal rate of reaction, the enzyme is working at its maximum capacity. This means that all the active sites of the enzyme molecules are occupied by acetaldehyde molecules. Therefore, choice A is true. The activation energy of a reaction is the energy required to initiate the reaction. It does not change at the maximal rate of reaction, so choice B is false. The change in free energy of a reaction is a measure of the spontaneity of the reaction. It also does not change at the maximal rate of reaction, so choice C is false. The enzyme is still specific for acetaldehyde at the maximal rate of reaction, as it is the substrate for the enzyme. Therefore, choice D is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
