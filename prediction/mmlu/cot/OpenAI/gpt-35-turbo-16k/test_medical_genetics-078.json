    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The initial transcript in eukaryotes undergoes several modifications before it can be translated into a protein. Let's analyze each option to determine which component is present in the initial transcript but is removed before translation occurs. \\n\\nA. Intron: Introns are non-coding regions of DNA that are transcribed into RNA but are removed during the process of RNA splicing. They are not present in the final mRNA molecule that is translated into a protein. \\n\\nB. 3\u2019 Poly A tail: The 3\u2019 Poly A tail is added to the mRNA molecule after transcription and is not present in the initial transcript. It plays a role in mRNA stability and translation efficiency. \\n\\nC. Ribosome binding site: The ribosome binding site, also known as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, is present in prokaryotes and is involved in the initiation of translation. It is not present in eukaryotes. \\n\\nD. 5\u2019 cap: The 5\u2019 cap is a modified guanine nucleotide that is added to the 5\u2019 end of the mRNA molecule during transcription. It is present in the initial transcript and is important for mRNA stability, transport, and translation initiation. However, it is not removed before translation occurs. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the component of transcribed RNA in eukaryotes that is present in the initial transcript but is removed before translation occurs is the intron. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Intron.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
