    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The postnatal growth of the maxilla involves various processes. Let's evaluate each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty: This statement is incorrect. Pneumatisation, or the enlargement of the maxillary sinus, continues throughout adulthood and does not cease at puberty.\\n\\nB. Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity: This statement is incorrect. The space for the eruption of permanent molars is created by the forward growth of the maxilla, not by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity.\\n\\nC. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to an increase in height and length of the maxilla: This statement is correct. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures, which connect the maxilla to the zygomatic bone, contribute to the vertical and horizontal growth of the maxilla.\\n\\nD. The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally: This statement is incorrect. The intermaxillary suture, which separates the two halves of the maxilla, typically fuses around the age of 2-3 years, not eight years postnatally.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct statement is C. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to an increase in height and length of the maxilla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
