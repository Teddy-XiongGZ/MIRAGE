    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Damage to the spinal cord at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra can potentially affect the function of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm, the main muscle involved in breathing. The phrenic nerve originates from the C3-C5 spinal cord segments, but it receives contributions from the C6 spinal cord segment as well. Therefore, damage at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra can disrupt the function of the phrenic nerve and impair breathing. Based on this, the patient is likely to experience difficulty breathing and will require some form of respiratory support.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
