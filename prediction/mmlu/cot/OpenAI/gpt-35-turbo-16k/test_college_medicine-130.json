    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In an SDS-PAGE procedure, the SDS serves as a detergent. The purpose of treating proteins with a detergent before running them through the electrophoresis gel is to disrupt the structure of the proteins and denature them. This is important because it allows the proteins to be separated solely on the basis of their size and molecular weight. Detergents like SDS bind to the proteins and coat them with a negative charge, which helps to unfold the proteins and break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure together. This results in the generation of linear fragments that can be sorted based on their size during electrophoresis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
