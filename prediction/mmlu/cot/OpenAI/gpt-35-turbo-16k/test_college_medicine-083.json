    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During multiple sprint activities, peripheral muscle fatigue can occur due to various factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. An accumulation of inorganic phosphate: Inorganic phosphate, specifically in the form of inorganic phosphate ions (Pi), is known to increase during intense exercise. However, it is not directly implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue.\\n\\nB. Development of hyperosmolality in the muscles: Hyperosmolality refers to an increased concentration of solutes in the muscle cells. While it can contribute to muscle fatigue, it is not specifically associated with peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities.\\n\\nC. An excess of antioxidants: Antioxidants are substances that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. While oxidative stress can contribute to muscle fatigue, an excess of antioxidants is not thought to be implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities.\\n\\nD. A lack of potassium: Potassium is an essential electrolyte involved in muscle contraction and nerve function. A deficiency in potassium can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue. Therefore, a lack of potassium is a possible factor implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities.\\n\\nConsidering the above information, the most likely answer is D. A lack of potassium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
