    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of each allele. In this case, each parent can pass on one of two alleles for each gene: A or a, B or b, and C or c. To calculate the frequency of AABBCC individuals, we need to multiply the frequencies of each allele being passed on by each parent. The frequency of each allele being passed on is 1/2, since each parent has a 50% chance of passing on either allele. Therefore, the frequency of AABBCC individuals would be (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8. However, we need to consider that AABBCC individuals can be formed in multiple ways. There are 3 genes, and each gene can have 2 alleles. Therefore, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of alleles for AABBCC individuals. So, the final frequency of AABBCC individuals would be (1/8) * 8 = 1/1 = 1.0. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 1.0/64.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
