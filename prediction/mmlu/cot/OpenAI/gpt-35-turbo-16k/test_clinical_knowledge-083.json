    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the amount of dopamine in milligrams that a 65 kg person will receive in an hour, we need to convert the rate from micrograms/kg/min to milligrams/hour. Step 1: Convert the person's weight from kilograms to grams: 65 kg = 65,000 grams. Step 2: Multiply the weight in grams by the rate of dopamine: 65,000 grams * 4 micrograms/kg/min. Step 3: Convert the result from micrograms to milligrams: (65,000 grams * 4 micrograms/kg/min) / 1,000 = 260,000 micrograms/hour. Step 4: Divide the result by 1,000 to convert micrograms to milligrams: 260,000 micrograms/hour / 1,000 = 260 milligrams/hour. Therefore, the person will receive 260 milligrams of dopamine in an hour.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1.56\"}"
