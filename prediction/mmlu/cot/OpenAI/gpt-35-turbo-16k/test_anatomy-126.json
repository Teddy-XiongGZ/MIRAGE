    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cranial nerves are a set of twelve pairs of nerves that originate from the brain and control various functions of the head and neck. To determine which cranial nerve is related to the sense of smell, we need to recall the functions of each nerve. \\n\\nA. Abducens: This cranial nerve controls the movement of the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for moving the eye laterally. It is not related to the sense of smell. \\n\\nB. Hypoglossal: This cranial nerve controls the movement of the tongue. It is not related to the sense of smell. \\n\\nC. Olfactory: This cranial nerve, also known as cranial nerve I, is specifically related to the sense of smell. It carries sensory information from the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity to the brain. \\n\\nD. Trochlear: This cranial nerve controls the movement of the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for moving the eye downward and laterally. It is not related to the sense of smell. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is C. Olfactory.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
