    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pulse is the rhythmic expansion and contraction of the arteries as blood is pumped through them by the heart. It can be palpated or felt when an artery is close to the surface of the skin. Veins do not have the same rhythmic expansion and contraction as arteries, so option B can be ruled out. The atria and ventricles are chambers of the heart, and their contractions do not directly cause the pulse. The left ventricle is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, but the pulse is not directly related to its contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is D. when an artery is close to the surface of the skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
