    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the cell will switch from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration. In anaerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is not oxygen but an alternative molecule, such as pyruvate or another organic molecule. This leads to the production of lactic acid or ethanol, depending on the organism. Therefore, the molecule that will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is A. Oxaloacetate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
