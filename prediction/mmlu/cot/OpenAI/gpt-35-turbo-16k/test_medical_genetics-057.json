    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder. Given that Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is a mitochondrial disorder, it is caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA, which is separate from the nuclear DNA found in chromosomes. Therefore, the correct answer is D. mitochondrial DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
