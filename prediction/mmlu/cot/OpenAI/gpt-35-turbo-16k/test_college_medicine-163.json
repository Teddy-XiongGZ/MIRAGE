    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"With an increasing number of sprints, the body's demand for energy increases. This increased demand is met by the body's energy systems, primarily the aerobic and anaerobic systems. The anaerobic system provides energy for high-intensity, short-duration activities, such as sprints. As the number of sprints increases, the anaerobic contribution progressively increases because the body relies more on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy demands. Therefore, the correct answer is A. anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
