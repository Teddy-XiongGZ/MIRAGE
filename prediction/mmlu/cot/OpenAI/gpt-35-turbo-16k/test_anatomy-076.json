    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The left internal capsule conveys motor neurons to the right leg. A CVA (cerebrovascular accident) in this area can result in damage to the motor neurons. Damage to the upper motor neurons in the internal capsule typically leads to spastic paralysis. This is characterized by increased muscle tone, exaggerated reflexes, and difficulty with voluntary movements. Flaccid paralysis, on the other hand, is caused by damage to the lower motor neurons and is characterized by decreased muscle tone and reflexes. Tremor is an involuntary shaking movement and is not specific to damage in the internal capsule. Hyporeflexia refers to decreased reflexes and is not typically associated with damage in the internal capsule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
