    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Severe blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen is most likely to involve the organs in that region. The appendix is located in the lower right abdomen, so it is unlikely to be involved. The gallbladder is located in the right upper abdomen, so it is also unlikely to be involved. The urinary bladder is located in the lower abdomen, so it is not likely to be affected by trauma to the left upper abdomen. The spleen, however, is located in the left upper abdomen and is vulnerable to injury from blunt trauma. Therefore, the most likely organ to be involved in this scenario is the spleen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Spleen\"}"
