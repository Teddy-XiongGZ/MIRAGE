    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cell nucleus contains genetic material, which is responsible for storing and transmitting hereditary information. This genetic material is composed of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Therefore, option I is correct. Proteins are also present in the cell nucleus, as they play a crucial role in various cellular processes. Therefore, option II is correct. RNA (ribonucleic acid) is also found in the cell nucleus, where it is involved in processes such as transcription and splicing. Therefore, option III is correct. Considering all these facts, the correct answer is option D, I, II, and III.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
