    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the external pH is low, it means that the solution is acidic. In this scenario, the best explanation for the effect of low external pH on the mitochondria is that it increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix. This is because the low external pH causes an influx of H+ ions into the mitochondria, leading to an increase in the acid concentration within the mitochondria matrix.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
