    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with episodes of fainting and fatigue, which suggests a cardiac conduction abnormality. The pulse rate of 40/min indicates bradycardia. The ECG shows a dissociation between the P-wave rate and the R-wave rate, indicating an atrioventricular (AV) block. The most likely diagnosis is a third-degree AV block, also known as a complete heart block, where there is complete dissociation between the atria and ventricles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
