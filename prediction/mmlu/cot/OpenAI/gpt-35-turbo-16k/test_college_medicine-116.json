    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Signal Detection Theory, there are four possible outcomes: hit, miss, false alarm, and correct rejection. A hit occurs when the signal is present and the observer detects it. A miss occurs when the signal is present but the observer fails to detect it. A false alarm occurs when the signal is absent but the observer mistakenly detects it. A correct rejection occurs when the signal is absent and the observer correctly does not detect it. In this scenario, the pilot is unable to see the light when it is 1 mile away, indicating a miss. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Miss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
