    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"C4 plants and CAM plants both employ strategies to reduce photorespiration. Let's compare the strategies of the two plant types. C4 plants fix CO2 as the 4-carbon acid oxaloacetate in the mesophyll cells. They then transport this 4-carbon acid to the bundle sheath cells, where the Calvin cycle takes place. On the other hand, CAM plants fix CO2 as the 3-carbon acid phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the mesophyll cells during the night. This CO2 is stored as the 4-carbon acid malate or malic acid. During the day, the malate is transported to the bundle sheath cells, where it releases CO2 for the Calvin cycle. Based on this comparison, the accurate comparison of the two strategies is option B. C4 plants fix CO2 in the mesophyll but carry out the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath, while CAM plants fix CO2 and carry out the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
