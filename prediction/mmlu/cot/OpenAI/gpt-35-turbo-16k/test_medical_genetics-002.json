    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The X-linked recessive condition affects males more frequently than females. In a human population, the frequency of affected males is given as 0.10 (one in ten). Since the condition is X-linked recessive, it means that affected males have one affected X chromosome and one normal Y chromosome. On the other hand, affected females would need to have two affected X chromosomes. The frequency of affected females can be calculated by squaring the frequency of affected males. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females would be 0.10 squared, which is 0.01.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
