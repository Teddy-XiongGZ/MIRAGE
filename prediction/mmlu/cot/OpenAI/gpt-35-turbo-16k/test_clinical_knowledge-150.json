    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An Early Warning Score (EWS) is a tool used to assess the severity of a patient's illness and to identify patients who may be deteriorating. It is typically used in hospital settings to monitor patients' vital signs and detect early signs of deterioration. A. Only patients over 60 years of age: Age alone is not a sufficient criterion for using an EWS. While older patients may be at higher risk for certain conditions, an EWS should be used based on the patient's clinical condition rather than age alone. B. Only patients admitted to the Emergency Department: Patients admitted to the Emergency Department are often acutely unwell and may require immediate medical attention. Therefore, it is appropriate to assess these patients using an EWS. C. Only patients who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit: Patients in intensive care or high dependency units are already being closely monitored and have access to more advanced monitoring systems. Therefore, an EWS may not be necessary for these patients. D. Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery: Patients who are acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively, as well as those who have undergone major surgery, are at increased risk of complications and deterioration. Therefore, it is important to assess these patients using an EWS to detect early signs of deterioration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
