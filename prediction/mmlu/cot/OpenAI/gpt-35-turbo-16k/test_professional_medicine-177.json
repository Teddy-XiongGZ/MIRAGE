    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pilonidal abscess. Pilonidal abscesses typically occur in the sacrococcygeal region and are more common in young males. They often present with a painful, erythematous, fluctuant mass that may have multiple midline pores. The history of trauma, such as a fall during a wrestling match, is consistent with the development of a pilonidal abscess. Anocutaneous fistula is characterized by a connection between the anal canal and the skin, which is not seen in this patient. Coccygodynia refers to pain in the coccyx region and does not typically present with a fluctuant mass. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory condition that typically affects the axillae, groin, and inframammary regions, and does not present with midline pores.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. pilonidal abscess\"}"
