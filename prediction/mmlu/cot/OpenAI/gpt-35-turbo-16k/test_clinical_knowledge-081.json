    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrogen ions are formed when pyruvate is converted to lactate during anaerobic glycolysis. This process occurs when there is a lack of oxygen and the body needs to produce ATP quickly. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, and under aerobic conditions, pyruvate is further metabolized in the mitochondria. However, when oxygen is limited, pyruvate is converted to lactate, resulting in the release of hydrogen ions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
