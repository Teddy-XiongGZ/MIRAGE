    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 32-year-old woman in active labor with a history of mild asthma. She is at 41 weeks' gestation and has a reactive fetal heart rate. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration in the fetal heart rate to 60/min. The patient then develops acute shortness of breath, cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Bleeding is noted from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). AFE is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when amniotic fluid, fetal cells, hair, or other debris enters the maternal circulation and triggers an immune response. This can lead to a cascade of events including cardiovascular collapse, respiratory distress, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can explain the bleeding from multiple sites. AFE typically presents with sudden onset of symptoms during labor or immediately postpartum. Intracerebral hemorrhage and myocardial infarction are less likely in this case as they do not explain the acute respiratory distress, cyanosis, and bleeding. Status asthmaticus is also less likely as it does not explain the sudden cardiovascular collapse and bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
