    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction and ongoing chest pain on exertion, it is likely that he is experiencing angina. Angina is typically caused by a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease. The patient is already taking nitroglycerin, which helps to dilate the coronary arteries and improve blood flow to the heart. The fact that the patient's heart sounds are normal suggests that there is no significant decrease in myocardial contractility. Peripheral vasodilation would not directly improve blood flow to the heart. Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs would be more relevant in the context of preventing thrombosis, but it would not directly improve blood flow to the heart. Therefore, the most likely mechanism by which a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent would improve the patient's symptoms is by dilating the coronary arteries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
