    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the perceived frequency of the gunshot, we need to consider the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave as observed by an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In this case, the camera is the observer and the gunshot is the source of the wave. First, we need to calculate the relative velocity between the camera and the car. The car is traveling at 108 km/h and the camera is traveling at 72 km/h in the same direction. Therefore, the relative velocity is 108 km/h - 72 km/h = 36 km/h. Next, we need to convert the relative velocity from km/h to m/s. 1 km/h is equal to 1000 m/3600 s. So, the relative velocity is (36 km/h * 1000 m/3600 s) = 10 m/s. Now, we can use the formula for the Doppler effect to calculate the perceived frequency. The formula is: perceived frequency = (speed of sound + relative velocity) / (speed of sound) * original frequency The speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s. Substituting the values into the formula, we get: perceived frequency = (343 m/s + 10 m/s) / (343 m/s) * 800 Hz perceived frequency = 353 / 343 * 800 Hz perceived frequency \u2248 823.4 Hz Therefore, the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at is approximately 823.4 Hz.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
