    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following facts was established prior to 1859, we need to evaluate the timeline of scientific discoveries. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. DNA provides the macromolecular basis of heredity: The discovery of DNA as the macromolecular basis of heredity was made by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, which is after 1859. Therefore, option A is not established prior to 1859.\\n\\nB. Mendelian principles explain why some traits are dominant and others are recessive: Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance and the establishment of Mendelian principles was published in 1866, which is also after 1859. Therefore, option B is not established prior to 1859.\\n\\nC. Prokaryotes include two major domains, the Bacteria and the Archaea: The discovery of the Archaea domain was made by Carl Woese in the 1970s, which is well after 1859. Therefore, option C is not established prior to 1859.\\n\\nD. There exist fossilized remains of species that have become extinct: The existence of fossilized remains of extinct species has been known since ancient times. Fossils have been studied and collected for centuries, with significant discoveries made well before 1859. Therefore, option D is established prior to 1859.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
