    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a ventricular septal defect, there is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. This allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, resulting in a mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. A. The percentage of oxygen in the left atrium would be lower: This statement is incorrect because the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, and the mixing of blood in the ventricular septal defect does not directly affect the oxygen content in the left atrium. B. The percentage of CO2 in the right ventricle would be higher: This statement is incorrect because the ventricular septal defect does not directly affect the carbon dioxide content in the right ventricle. CO2 levels are primarily determined by the metabolic processes in the body. C. The percentage of oxygen in the right atrium would be lower: This statement is correct. The mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the ventricular septal defect would result in a decrease in the oxygen content in the right atrium. D. The percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be higher: This statement is incorrect. The mixing of blood in the ventricular septal defect would result in a decrease in the oxygen content in the right ventricle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
