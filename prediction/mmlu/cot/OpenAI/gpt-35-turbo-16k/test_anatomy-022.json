    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The regional lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue is determined by the location of the lymph nodes that receive the lymphatic drainage from that area. The submental lymph nodes are located beneath the chin, while the submandibular lymph nodes are located beneath the mandible.
