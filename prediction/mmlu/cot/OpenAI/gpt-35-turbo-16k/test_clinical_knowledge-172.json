    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The frontal lobe of the brain's cortex is responsible for a variety of functions, including executive functions, decision-making, problem-solving, and controlling voluntary movements. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. The sleep/wake cycle: The sleep/wake cycle is primarily regulated by the hypothalamus, not the frontal lobe.\\n\\nB. The ability to draw shapes: Drawing shapes involves motor skills and visual perception, which are controlled by the frontal lobe, specifically the motor cortex and the visual association areas.\\n\\nC. Understanding others' speech: Understanding speech is primarily associated with the temporal lobe, particularly the Wernicke's area.\\n\\nD. Visual perception: Visual perception involves processing and interpreting visual information, which is primarily controlled by the occipital lobe, not the frontal lobe.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. The ability to draw shapes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
