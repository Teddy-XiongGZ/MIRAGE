    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypothyroidism is a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, which leads to a decrease in the production of thyroid hormones. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is true of hypothyroidism. \\n\\nA. Weight loss: Hypothyroidism is actually associated with weight gain, not weight loss. Therefore, this option is not true of hypothyroidism. \\n\\nB. Pre-tibial myxoedema: Pre-tibial myxoedema is a skin condition that can occur in some individuals with Graves' disease, which is a form of hyperthyroidism. It is not typically associated with hypothyroidism. Therefore, this option is not true of hypothyroidism. \\n\\nC. A raised TSH level: In hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormones, which leads to an increase in the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland. Therefore, a raised TSH level is true of hypothyroidism. \\n\\nD. An aversion to warm places: Hypothyroidism can cause sensitivity to cold, but it does not typically result in an aversion to warm places. Therefore, this option is not true of hypothyroidism. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. A raised TSH level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
