    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The palatine processes refer to the bony structures that form the hard palate, which is the roof of the mouth. The fusion of the palatine processes is an important step in the development of the palate. During embryonic development, the palatine processes start to form around the sixth week post-fertilization. However, complete fusion of the palatine processes occurs later in development. The fusion of the palatine processes is typically completed around the tenth week post-fertilization. Therefore, the correct answer is C. ten weeks post-fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
