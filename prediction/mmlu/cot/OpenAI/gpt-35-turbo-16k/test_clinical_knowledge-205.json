    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's analyze each option one by one. \\n\\nOption A states that alcohol makes the tremor of benign essential tremor worse. Benign essential tremor is a common movement disorder characterized by involuntary shaking or trembling of the hands, arms, head, or other parts of the body. While alcohol can temporarily improve the symptoms of essential tremor, it does not worsen the tremor. Therefore, option A is false. \\n\\nOption B states that hemiballismus is due to a stroke causing paralysis of the distal half of the arm. Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder characterized by sudden, involuntary, and violent flinging or jerking movements of one side of the body, typically the arm. It is usually caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleus in the brain, not by a stroke causing paralysis. Therefore, option B is false. \\n\\nOption C states that a 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions that cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. A 'milkmaid' grip refers to a hand posture where the fingers move in a repetitive opening and closing motion, resembling the milking of a cow. This hand posture is commonly seen in dystonia. Therefore, option C is true. \\n\\nOption D states that writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia. Writer's cramp is a specific type of dystonia that affects the muscles of the hand and forearm, causing difficulty in writing or performing fine motor tasks. Therefore, option D is true. \\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is options C and D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C and D\"}"
