    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the number of fragments a restriction enzyme would cleave a double-stranded bacteriophage with a genome size of 5,000 bp into, we need to consider the recognition sequence and the average fragment size. Since the restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4 base sequence, it will cleave the DNA at every occurrence of that sequence. The average fragment size can be estimated by dividing the genome size by the number of recognition sites. In this case, the genome size is 5,000 bp and the recognition sequence is 4 bases long. To calculate the number of recognition sites, we subtract the length of the recognition sequence from the genome size and add 1 (to account for the first recognition site). So, the number of recognition sites would be (5000 - 4) + 1 = 4997. Therefore, the average fragment size would be 5000 bp / 4997 = 1.0006 bp. Since the enzyme cleaves at every recognition site, the number of fragments would be equal to the number of recognition sites. So, the answer is D. about 50.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
