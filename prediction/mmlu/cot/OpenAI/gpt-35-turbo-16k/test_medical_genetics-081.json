    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peroxisomal disorders are a group of genetic disorders that affect the function of peroxisomes, which are small organelles involved in various metabolic processes. To determine which of the given conditions is a peroxisomal disorder, we need to evaluate each option. \\n\\nA. Acute intermittent porphyria is not a peroxisomal disorder. It is a rare metabolic disorder that affects the production of heme, a component of hemoglobin.\\n\\nB. Maple syrup urine disease is also not a peroxisomal disorder. It is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the breakdown of certain amino acids.\\n\\nC. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is not a peroxisomal disorder either. It is an inherited disorder that affects the breakdown of fatty acids.\\n\\nD. Zellweger syndrome is a peroxisomal disorder. It is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence or dysfunction of peroxisomes, leading to various neurological and developmental abnormalities.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is D. Zellweger syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
