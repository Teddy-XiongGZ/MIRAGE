    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"QTL analysis stands for Quantitative Trait Locus analysis. It is a statistical method used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross. This method helps in understanding the genetic basis of complex traits such as height, weight, disease susceptibility, etc. QTL analysis involves mapping genetic markers across the genome and correlating them with the phenotypic variation observed in the population. Therefore, the correct answer is A. identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
