    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the compatible blood types that can be given to a person with blood group B (rhesus negative), we need to consider the ABO blood group system and the Rh factor. Blood group B means that the person has B antigens on their red blood cells. Rhesus negative means that the person does not have the Rh antigen on their red blood cells. In the ABO blood group system, there are four main blood types: A, B, AB, and O. In terms of compatibility, a person with blood group B (rhesus negative) can receive blood from donors who have the same blood group (B) and are also rhesus negative. This means that the compatible blood types are blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative). Therefore, the correct answer is C. Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
