    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After consuming the 800-calorie meal, the body will initially use glucose from the meal for energy. Once the glucose from the meal is used up, the body will need to maintain its serum glucose concentration through other mechanisms. Option A, continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal, is unlikely because the meal was consumed 12 hours ago and the body would have already absorbed and utilized the nutrients. Option B, glucose release from skeletal muscle, is also unlikely because skeletal muscle primarily uses glucose for its own energy needs and does not release glucose into the bloodstream. Option D, increased leptin release from adipose tissues, is not directly involved in maintaining serum glucose concentration. Therefore, the most likely mechanism involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration is option C, glycogenolysis in the liver. Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver into glucose, which can then be released into the bloodstream to maintain serum glucose levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
