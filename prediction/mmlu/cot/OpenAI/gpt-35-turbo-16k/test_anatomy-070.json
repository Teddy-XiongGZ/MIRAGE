    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proprioceptive receptors are responsible for providing information about the position and movement of our body parts. In the case of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), these receptors are located in specific structures. The TMJ is a synovial joint that allows for movement of the jaw. The major concentrations of proprioceptive receptors in the TMJ are typically found in the structures that are directly involved in its movement and stability. Option A states that the proprioceptive receptors are located in the capsule and ligaments of the TMJ and the medial pterygoid muscle. The capsule and ligaments of the TMJ are responsible for providing stability to the joint, while the medial pterygoid muscle is involved in jaw movement. Option B states that the proprioceptive receptors are located in the capsule and ligaments of the TMJ and the lateral pterygoid muscle. The lateral pterygoid muscle is also involved in jaw movement. Option C states that the proprioceptive receptors are located in the articular disc of the TMJ and the medial pterygoid muscle. The articular disc is a structure that separates the mandibular condyle from the temporal bone and helps with smooth movement of the joint. Option D states that the proprioceptive receptors are located in the articular disc of the TMJ and the lateral pterygoid muscle. Based on the functions of these structures and their involvement in TMJ movement and stability, the most likely answer is option A. The capsule and ligaments of the TMJ provide stability, while the medial pterygoid muscle is involved in jaw movement. Therefore, the major concentrations of proprioceptive receptors providing information about the position of the TMJ are located in the capsule and ligaments of the TMJ and the medial pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
