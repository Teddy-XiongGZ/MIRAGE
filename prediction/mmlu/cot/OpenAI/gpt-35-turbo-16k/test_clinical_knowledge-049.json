    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Free fatty acids are hydrophobic molecules and cannot dissolve in the aqueous environment of the blood. Therefore, they require a carrier protein to be transported in the blood. One of the main carrier proteins for free fatty acids in the blood is albumin. Albumin is a protein produced by the liver and it has a high affinity for fatty acids. It binds to the fatty acids and transports them in the blood. Lipoproteins, on the other hand, are responsible for transporting cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, not free fatty acids. Glucose is a carbohydrate and does not play a direct role in transporting free fatty acids in the blood. Red blood cells do not have the ability to transport free fatty acids. Therefore, the correct answer is D. bound to albumin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
