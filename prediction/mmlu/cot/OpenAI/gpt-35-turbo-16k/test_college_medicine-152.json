    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle contraction requires energy, which is provided by the breakdown of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is the primary source of energy for muscle contraction. ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is the product of ATP breakdown and does not directly provide energy for muscle contraction. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy molecule that can be rapidly converted to ATP to provide energy for muscle contraction, but it is not the primary source of energy. Oxidative phosphorylation is a process that occurs in the mitochondria and generates ATP, but it is not the immediate source of energy for muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
