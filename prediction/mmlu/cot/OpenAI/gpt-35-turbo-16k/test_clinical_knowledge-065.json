    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In hypovolaemic shock, the body is experiencing a significant loss of blood volume. As blood volume decreases, the body tries to compensate by increasing heart rate and constricting blood vessels to maintain blood pressure. This compensatory mechanism helps to maintain blood flow to vital organs. However, there is a limit to how much blood can be lost before these compensatory mechanisms start to fail. Typically, a loss of around 10-15% of blood volume is required before changes in heart rate and blood pressure become evident. Therefore, the answer is B. 10%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
