    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-chromosome inactivation refers to the process by which one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals is genetically turned off. This is necessary to achieve dosage compensation between males and females, as males only have one X chromosome. Option A correctly describes this process. Option B is incorrect because X-chromosome inactivation in humans is random, resulting in different X chromosomes being inactive in different cells. Option C is incorrect because X-chromosome inactivation does not affect the Y chromosome. Option D is incorrect because X-chromosome inactivation occurs in mammals, including humans, and not just in fruit flies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
