    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Substance abuse throughout adolescence can have detrimental effects on the brain, particularly on executive functioning. Executive functioning refers to a set of cognitive processes that are responsible for goal-directed behavior, impulse control, and decision-making. Given that the young adult in question is experiencing psychological symptoms reflecting diminished executive functioning, it is likely that there are pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex, which is the region of the brain responsible for executive functions. Therefore, statement I is likely true. Additionally, reduced behavioral impulse control is a common symptom of diminished executive functioning, so statement III is also likely true. However, there is no mention of auditory hallucinations in the question stem, so statement II cannot be inferred from the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is C. I and III only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
