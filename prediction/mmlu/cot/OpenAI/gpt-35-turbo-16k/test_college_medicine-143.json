    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The World Systems Theory categorizes countries into core, periphery, and semi-periphery based on their level of economic development and integration into the global economy. Core countries are highly developed, have advanced industries, and dominate the global market. Periphery countries are less developed, have limited industrialization, and are dependent on core countries for economic resources. Semi-periphery countries fall in between, they have some developed industries and are more economically diversified compared to periphery countries, but they are not as dominant or advanced as core countries. Based on this information, the answer choice that correlates best with semi-periphery countries is C. A diversified and developed economy. Semi-periphery countries have a mix of developed and developing industries, and they have a more diversified economic base compared to periphery countries. This allows them to have a higher level of economic development and integration into the global economy compared to periphery countries, but they are still not as advanced or dominant as core countries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
