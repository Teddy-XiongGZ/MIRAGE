    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dependent variable is the variable that is being measured or observed in the experiment. It is the outcome variable that is expected to change as a result of manipulating the independent variables. In this experiment, the independent variables are the amount the subjects were compensated, the room in which they were asked to recall facts, the number of facts they can recall, and the time they were given to learn the facts. I. The amount the subjects were compensated: This is an independent variable, as it is being manipulated by the researcher. It is not a dependent variable. II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts: This is an independent variable, as it is being manipulated by the researcher. It is not a dependent variable. III. The number of facts the subjects can recall: This is a dependent variable, as it is the outcome variable that is expected to change based on the manipulation of the independent variables. IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts: This is a dependent variable, as it is the outcome variable that is expected to change based on the manipulation of the independent variables. Based on the above analysis, the dependent variables in this experiment are III and IV. Therefore, the answer is D. I and III and IV only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
