    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In order to determine which phases are common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis, we need to understand the phases of both processes. Meiosis consists of two rounds of cell division, resulting in four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Mitosis, on the other hand, consists of one round of cell division, resulting in two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Now let's analyze the phases: I. G0: This phase refers to the resting phase of the cell cycle, where the cell is not actively dividing. It is not a phase specific to either meiosis or mitosis. II. G2 phase: This is the phase following DNA replication, where the cell prepares for division. Both meiosis and mitosis have a G2 phase. III. S phase: This is the phase where DNA replication occurs. Both meiosis and mitosis involve DNA replication, so they have an S phase. Based on this analysis, the phases common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis are G2 phase and S phase. Therefore, the answer is C. II and III only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
