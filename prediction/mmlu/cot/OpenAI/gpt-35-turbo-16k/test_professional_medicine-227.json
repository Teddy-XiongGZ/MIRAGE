    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of white lesions in the mouth of a 3-week-old infant is suggestive of oral thrush, which is a common fungal infection caused by Candida species. The fact that the lesions do not come off when gently scraped indicates that they are likely to be adherent pseudomembranes. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for oral thrush in infants is Nystatin, which is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida species. Acyclovir and Valacyclovir are antiviral medications used to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus, and would not be appropriate in this case. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida species, but it is typically reserved for more severe or recurrent cases of oral thrush and is not the first-line treatment for infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Nystatin\"}"
