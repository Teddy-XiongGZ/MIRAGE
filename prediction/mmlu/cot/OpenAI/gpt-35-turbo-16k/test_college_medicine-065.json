    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a double stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines (adenine and guanine) to pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine) is a constant ratio. The base pairing rules in DNA dictate that adenine always pairs with thymine and guanine always pairs with cytosine. Therefore, for every adenine in the DNA molecule, there will be a thymine, and for every guanine, there will be a cytosine. This means that the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is always 1:1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. always 1:1.\"}"
