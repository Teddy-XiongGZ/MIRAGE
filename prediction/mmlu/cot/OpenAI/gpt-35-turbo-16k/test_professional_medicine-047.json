    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the efferent arteriole is constricted, it causes an increase in resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus. This leads to an increase in hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus. According to Starling's forces, the filtration of fluid across the glomerular capillaries is determined by the balance between hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure. Therefore, when the efferent arteriole is constricted, the most likely change in the glomeruli is an increased hydrostatic pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
