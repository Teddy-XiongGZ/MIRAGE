    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ferns undergo alternation of generations, which means they have two distinct phases in their life cycle: a sporophyte phase and a gametophyte phase. The sporophyte is the diploid (2n) phase that produces spores through meiosis. The spores then develop into the gametophyte, which is the haploid (n) phase. The gametophyte produces gametes through mitosis. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
