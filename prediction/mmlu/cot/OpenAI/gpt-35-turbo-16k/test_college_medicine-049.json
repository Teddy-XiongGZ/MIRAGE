    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to balance the equation first. The balanced equation for the reaction is: C2H4 + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 2H2O. From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of ethane (C2H4) reacts to produce 2 moles of carbon dioxide (CO2). To find the number of moles of ethane, we divide the given mass (84g) by the molar mass of ethane (2*12 + 4*1 = 28g/mol). This gives us 3 moles of ethane. Since the ratio of ethane to carbon dioxide is 1:2, we multiply the number of moles of ethane by 2 to find the number of moles of carbon dioxide. Finally, we multiply the number of moles of carbon dioxide by its molar mass (44g/mol) to find the mass of carbon dioxide produced.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 264g\"}"
