    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand what haemorrhoids are. Haemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus. They can be internal or external. Now let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Bleeding haemorrhoids can lead to melaena per rectum (PR), which is the passage of black, tarry stools. However, this is not always the case, as bleeding from haemorrhoids can also present as bright red blood in the stool.\\n\\nB. Pregnancy is indeed a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids. The increased pressure on the veins in the pelvic area during pregnancy can lead to the development of haemorrhoids.\\n\\nC. Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids, which are internal haemorrhoids that do not prolapse, is usually painless. Pain is more commonly associated with second and third degree haemorrhoids.\\n\\nD. Second degree haemorrhoids can be manually reduced or pushed back into the anal canal. This is in contrast to third degree haemorrhoids, which cannot be manually reduced.\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is B. Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
