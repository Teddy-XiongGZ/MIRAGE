    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations are errors in DNA that can occur spontaneously or be induced by external factors such as carcinogens. They can have various effects on an organism, including harmful, neutral, or even beneficial effects. Therefore, option A, which states that mutations are always harmful, is incorrect. Option B, which states that mutations only occur in the presence of carcinogens, is also incorrect as mutations can occur spontaneously. Option C, which states that mutations increase tumor growth, is too specific and does not encompass all the possible effects of mutations. The most accurate answer is option D, which states that mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
