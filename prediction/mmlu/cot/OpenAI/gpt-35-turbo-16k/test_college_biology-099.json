    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To induce polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote, we need to choose an agent that disrupts the normal process of cell division. Polyploidy refers to the condition where an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes. A. Penicillin is an antibiotic that targets bacterial cell walls and does not have any effect on eukaryotic cell division. It does not induce polyploidy. B. Colchicine is a drug that disrupts microtubule formation, which is essential for cell division. It prevents the separation of chromosomes during mitosis or meiosis, leading to polyploidy. Therefore, colchicine can induce polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. C. Tetracycline is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and does not have any effect on eukaryotic cell division. It does not induce polyploidy. D. Puromycin is an antibiotic that causes premature termination of protein synthesis. It does not directly affect cell division and does not induce polyploidy. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Colchicine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
