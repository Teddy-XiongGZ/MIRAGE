    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Male to male transmission is a key feature of X-linked inheritance patterns. This is because males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Therefore, if a trait is carried on the X chromosome, it can only be passed from a carrier female to her sons. In the case of X-linked recessive inheritance, affected males can pass the trait to their daughters who become carriers, but not to their sons. Therefore, the answer is D. X-linked recessive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
