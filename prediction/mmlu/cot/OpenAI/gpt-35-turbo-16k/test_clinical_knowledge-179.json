    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, the initial energy source is required to be readily available and able to provide energy quickly. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to produce ATP, but it takes longer to produce ATP compared to other energy sources. Creatine phosphorylation is a process where creatine phosphate donates a phosphate group to ADP to quickly regenerate ATP. Phosphocreatine stores are the storage form of creatine phosphate in muscles. ATP stores are the immediate source of energy for muscle contractions. Considering the requirement for quick energy production, the most likely initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds is phosphocreatine stores.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
