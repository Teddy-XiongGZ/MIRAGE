    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autozygosity mapping is a technique used to identify regions of the genome where an individual has inherited two copies of the same allele from a common ancestor. This occurs when both parents are carriers of a recessive allele for a particular disorder. Therefore, autozygosity mapping is used to map disorders that show autosomal recessive inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Autosomal recessive\"}"
