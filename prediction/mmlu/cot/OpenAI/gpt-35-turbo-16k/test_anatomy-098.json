    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Macrostomia refers to an abnormally large mouth opening. To determine the cause of macrostomia, we need to understand the normal embryological development of the face. During embryogenesis, the face develops from several processes and arches. The maxillary process contributes to the formation of the upper jaw and lip, while the mandibular process contributes to the formation of the lower jaw and lip. The frontonasal process gives rise to the forehead, nose, and upper lip. The hyoid arch is not directly involved in the formation of the mouth. Therefore, to answer the question, we need to identify which processes fail to fuse in macrostomia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maxillary and frontonasal processes.\"}"
