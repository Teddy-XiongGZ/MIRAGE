    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Homeobox sequences are DNA sequences that code for a specific type of protein called a transcription factor. These sequences are involved in the regulation of gene expression during development. Now let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. are present in the genome of many animal species: This is true. Homeobox sequences are highly conserved and found in the genomes of many animal species.\\n\\nB. are found in prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes: This is false. Homeobox sequences are specific to eukaryotes and are not found in prokaryotes.\\n\\nC. were identified as the integration sites for bacterial viruses: This is false. Homeobox sequences are not integration sites for bacterial viruses.\\n\\nD. represent integration sites for transposable elements: This is false. Homeobox sequences are not integration sites for transposable elements.\\n\\nBased on the above evaluation, the correct answer is A. are present in the genome of many animal species.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
