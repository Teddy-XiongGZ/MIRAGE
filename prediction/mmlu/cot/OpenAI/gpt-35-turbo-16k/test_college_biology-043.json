    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gas exchange in plants occurs through small openings called stomata, which are typically found on the leaves. However, in woody stems, gas exchange can also occur through specialized structures called lenticels. Lenticels are small, raised areas on the surface of the stem that allow for the exchange of gases between the internal tissues and the external environment. Terminal buds are the growing points at the tips of stems and do not directly participate in gas exchange. Nodes are the points on the stem where leaves, branches, or flowers are attached and do not directly participate in gas exchange. Internodes are the segments of the stem between the nodes and do not directly participate in gas exchange. Therefore, the correct answer is A. lenticels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
