    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation, a process that breaks down fatty acids to generate acetyl-CoA. However, fatty acids cannot freely cross the mitochondrial membrane. They need to be attached to a molecule to be transported across. This molecule is not thiokinase, as thiokinase is an enzyme involved in the activation of fatty acids, but not their transport. It's also not coenzyme A or acetyl-CoA, as these molecules are involved in the breakdown of fatty acids inside the mitochondria, but not their transport. The correct answer is carnitine, which binds to fatty acids and helps transport them across the mitochondrial membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. carnitine\"}"
