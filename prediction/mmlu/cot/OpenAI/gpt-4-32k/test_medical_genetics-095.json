    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzyme assays are tests that measure the activity of a specific enzyme. Cystic fibrosis is identified through a sweat test, not an enzyme assay. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that's usually inherited, and it's diagnosed through a DNA test. Oculocutaneous albinism is a group of conditions that affect coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes and can be diagnosed through genetic testing or physical examination. Tay-Sachs disease, however, is a rare inherited disorder that progressively destroys nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. The most common form of Tay-Sachs disease becomes apparent in infancy and is characterized by a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities that results in death by age 4. The disease occurs when harmful quantities of gangliosides accumulate in the nerve cells' brain, a process that can be identified through an enzyme assay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
