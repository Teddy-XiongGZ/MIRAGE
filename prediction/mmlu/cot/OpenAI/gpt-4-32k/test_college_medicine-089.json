    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vygotsky's zone of proximal development refers to the difference between what a learner can do without help and what he or she can do with help. It is the area where the most sensitive instruction or guidance should be given - allowing the child to develop skills they will then use on their own. Option A is about building muscle memory, which is not necessarily related to the zone of proximal development. Option B is about a flute player not being able to finish a complex piece, which could be related to the zone of proximal development, but it doesn't mention any guidance or help. Option C is about a student submitting a paper for review, which could be related to the zone of proximal development, but it doesn't mention any guidance or help. Option D is about a diver taking instruction from her coach to improve her form, which is directly related to the zone of proximal development because it involves guidance and help.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
