    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation, a process that breaks down fatty acids to generate acetyl-CoA. Before they can be transported into the mitochondria, fatty acids must be activated in the cytosol by thiokinase, which results in the formation of fatty acyl-CoA. However, the fatty acyl-CoA cannot directly cross the mitochondrial membrane. Instead, the fatty acyl group is transferred to carnitine, forming acylcarnitine. This acylcarnitine can cross the mitochondrial membrane, and once inside, the fatty acyl group is transferred back to CoA, ready for beta-oxidation. Therefore, fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to carnitine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. carnitine\"}"
