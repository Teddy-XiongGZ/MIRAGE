    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha is the probability of making a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, it's the probability of finding a difference when one does not exist. By setting alpha at 0.01 instead of 0.05, we are making the criteria for statistical significance more stringent. This means we are less likely to make a Type I error, but it does not increase the power of the study or decrease the likelihood of a Type II error. It also does not increase the likelihood of statistically significant findings. Instead, it allows us to report significant findings with greater confidence because we have set a higher bar for what we consider to be statistically significant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
