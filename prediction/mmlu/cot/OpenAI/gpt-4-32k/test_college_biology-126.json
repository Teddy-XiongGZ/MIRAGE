    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Double fertilization is a process unique to angiosperms, or flowering plants. In this process, one sperm cell fertilizes the egg cell to form a zygote, which will develop into the embryo. The second sperm cell fertilizes the two polar nuclei in the center of the embryo sac. This fertilization event leads to the formation of the endosperm, a tissue that provides nutrients to the developing embryo.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. endosperm\"}"
