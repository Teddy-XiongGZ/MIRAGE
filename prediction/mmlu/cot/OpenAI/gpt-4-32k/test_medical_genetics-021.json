    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-chromosome inactivation is a process that occurs in female mammals to balance the dosage of X-chromosome gene expression between males and females. It does not cause the Y chromosome to be genetically inactive, so option C is incorrect. It also does not occur in fruit flies, so option D is incorrect. While it does occur in humans, it is not true that the same X chromosome is inactive in all cells of a female. The inactivation is random, meaning that some cells will have one X chromosome inactivated, while others will have the other X chromosome inactivated. Therefore, option B is also incorrect. This leaves us with option A, which correctly states that X-chromosome inactivation results in genetically turning off one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
