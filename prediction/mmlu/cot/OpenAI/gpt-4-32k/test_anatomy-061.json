    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The glossopharyngeal nerve, or cranial nerve IX, has several functions including taste and somatosensory sensation from the posterior third of the tongue. Therefore, damage to this nerve would result in loss of these sensations in that area. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue are innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) for taste and the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) for somatosensory sensation. The muscles of the tongue are primarily innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
