    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that have cell walls, similar to plants. However, the composition of their cell walls is different. Silica is a mineral and is not used in the construction of cell walls in fungi. Lignin is a complex organic polymer that is used in the cell walls of plants, not fungi. Collagen fibers are a type of protein that is found in animals, not fungi. Chitin, on the other hand, is a long-chain polymer of a derivative of glucose and is found in the cell walls of fungi.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
