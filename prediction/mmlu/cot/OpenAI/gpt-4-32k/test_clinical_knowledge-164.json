    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peak flow results are used to measure how well a person's lungs are working. The readings should be consistent and not vary too much. A variation of 10 litres per minute might be too small, considering the natural variability of the human body. 100 litres per minute seems too large, as it would indicate a significant difference in lung function. Between 20 and 30 litres per minute seems more reasonable. However, according to the British Thoracic Society, the readings should be within 20 litres per minute of each other.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
