    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the option that best supports the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive for this species of goose. This means we're looking for an option that suggests some sort of advantage or benefit to cliff nesting. Option A doesn't provide any advantage of cliff nesting. Option C is about the instinct of chicks, not about the advantage of cliff nesting. Option D, while it suggests that more chicks survive than are killed, it doesn't necessarily mean that cliff nesting is adaptive or beneficial. Option B, however, suggests that cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than beach nesting, which would be consistent with the idea that cliff nesting is adaptive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
