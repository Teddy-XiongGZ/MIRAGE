    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tumor suppressor genes are genes that regulate cell division and prevent the formation of tumors. APC, NF1, and RB1 are all known tumor suppressor genes. APC is involved in cell growth and division, NF1 regulates cell division and growth, and RB1 plays a role in controlling cell cycle progression. On the other hand, RET is not a tumor suppressor gene. Instead, it is a proto-oncogene, which, when mutated, can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and potentially cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. RET\"}"
