    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatigue in high intensity exercise is not related to a lack of skill, so option D can be eliminated. A fall in the cell concentration of ADP, option A, is not a fundamental cause of fatigue. ADP is actually produced when ATP is used for energy, so if anything, we would expect ADP levels to rise, not fall, during high intensity exercise. Inhibition of ATP production, option B, could potentially cause fatigue, but it's not the most direct cause. The most direct cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand, option C. When you're exercising intensely, your muscles are working hard and need a lot of ATP. If the supply can't keep up with the demand, you'll start to feel fatigued.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
