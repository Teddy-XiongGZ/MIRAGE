    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has a positive PPD skin test, which is indicative of a tuberculosis infection. The size of the induration (10mm) is significant, especially in a child and in a person who is likely to have been exposed to TB, such as in a homeless shelter. The next step in management for a positive PPD test is to rule out active tuberculosis disease, which is done by ordering a chest x-ray. The other options are not as relevant. Calling her previous physician may not provide any additional useful information. Ordering a test for HIV antibody is not the immediate concern, although it could be considered later as HIV increases the risk for TB. Repeating the PPD skin test is not necessary as the test is already positive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Order a chest x-ray\"}"
