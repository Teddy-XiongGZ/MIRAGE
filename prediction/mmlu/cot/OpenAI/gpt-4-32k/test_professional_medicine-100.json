    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden onset shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating are suggestive of a cardiovascular event. His risk factors include hypertension, smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The presence of a diastolic blowing murmur heard over the left sternal border that radiates to the right sternal border, along with decreased femoral pulses bilaterally, are indicative of aortic dissection. Acute myocardial infarction typically presents with a crushing chest pain, but it does not usually cause a diastolic murmur or decreased femoral pulses. Esophageal rupture would present with severe chest pain following vomiting, which is not mentioned in the case. Mitral valve prolapse would typically present with a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur, not a diastolic murmur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Aortic dissection\"}"
