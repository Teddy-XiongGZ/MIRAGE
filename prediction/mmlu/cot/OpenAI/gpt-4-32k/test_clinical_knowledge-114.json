    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In genetics, an allele is a variant form of a gene. Some genes have a variety of different forms, which are located at the same position, or genetic locus, on a chromosome. In an individual, one form of the allele (the dominant one) may be expressed more than another form (the recessive one). The recessive allele is the one that is masked when the dominant allele is present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
