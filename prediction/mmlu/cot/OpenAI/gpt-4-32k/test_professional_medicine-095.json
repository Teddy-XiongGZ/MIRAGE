    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of increasing foot pain, pale appearance of the lower extremity, and weak popliteal pulse with a pulseless foot suggest acute limb ischemia, likely due to graft occlusion. The most appropriate initial step in management is to confirm the diagnosis. Bedside compartment pressure measurements (choice A) are used to diagnose compartment syndrome, which is not suggested by the clinical picture. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy (choice C) and intraoperative angiography (choice D) are management options after the diagnosis is confirmed. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity (choice B) is a noninvasive test that can quickly confirm the diagnosis of graft occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
