    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A. This is not correct because mtDNA actually mutates at a faster rate than nuclear DNA, which makes it useful for studying recent evolutionary changes. B. This is correct. mtDNA is passed down from mother to child without recombination, which makes it useful for tracing maternal lineage. C. This is not correct. The hypervariable, noncoding regions of mtDNA actually have many single nucleotide polymorphisms, which makes them useful for studying genetic diversity. D. This is not correct. While mitochondria do have their own DNA, most mitochondrial proteins are actually coded for by nuclear genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
