    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cytochalasin B is a drug known to interfere with the polymerization of actin, a protein that makes up microfilaments. Therefore, it would not affect microtubules, which are composed of tubulin, not actin. The effect of cytochalasin B on actin is reversible, meaning that once the drug is removed, the actin can repolymerize into microfilaments. Therefore, the correct answer should involve microfilaments and reversible depolymerization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
