    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The atrioventricular bundle, also known as the bundle of His, is a part of the electrical conduction system of the heart that transmits impulses from the atria to the ventricles. It is not formed of autonomic nerve processes, so options A and C can be eliminated. The bundle is indeed formed of Purkinje fibers. Now, we need to determine whether it is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. The atrioventricular bundle is indeed the only pathway by which an electrical signal can travel from the atria to the ventricles. This is because the fibrous skeleton of the heart electrically isolates the atria from the ventricles, with the exception of the atrioventricular bundle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
