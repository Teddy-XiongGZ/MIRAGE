    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyperventilation is the condition where you start to breathe very quickly. Healthy individuals who hyperventilate will blow off carbon dioxide from their bodies, causing a decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. The decrease in carbon dioxide concentration in the blood leads to an increase in pH, meaning a decrease in the concentration of hydrogen ions (since pH is inversely proportional to the concentration of hydrogen ions).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions\"}"
