    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where the offspring (F1 generation) of two homozygous parents (one with dark blue flowers and one with white flowers) have an intermediate phenotype (light blue flowers). This suggests that neither of the parental alleles is completely dominant over the other. Furthermore, when the F1 generation is self-fertilized, the resulting F2 generation shows a 1:2:1 ratio of the parental and intermediate phenotypes. This is consistent with the Mendelian inheritance pattern observed in incomplete dominance, where the heterozygous genotype results in an intermediate phenotype.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. incomplete dominance\"}"
