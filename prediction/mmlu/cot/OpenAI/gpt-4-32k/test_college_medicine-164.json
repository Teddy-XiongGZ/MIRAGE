    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the principle of continuity in fluid dynamics, which states that the product of the cross-sectional area and the velocity of the fluid remains constant. In other words, if the area decreases, the velocity must increase to keep the product constant. So, if the area is reduced to 1/3, the velocity must triple to keep the product constant. Therefore, the final velocity of the water as it exits is 2 m/s * 3 = 6 m/s.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
