    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes an enzyme that catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group from one reactant to another. This is a transfer reaction, where a functional group (in this case, a nitrogen group) is transferred from one molecule to another. Therefore, the enzyme that catalyzes this type of reaction is a transferase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Transferase\"}"
