    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient has undergone a total knee replacement, which puts him at risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The best prophylaxis for DVT in this case would be pharmacological, as it is more effective than mechanical methods like pneumatic compression devices. However, the patient has a low ejection fraction, indicating heart failure, which makes him at risk for bleeding. Therefore, we need a drug that is both effective and has a low risk of bleeding. Warfarin and heparin have a higher risk of bleeding and require monitoring, which is not ideal in this case. Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, is a good choice because it is effective, has a lower risk of bleeding than heparin and warfarin, and does not require monitoring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Subcutaneous enoxaparin\"}"
