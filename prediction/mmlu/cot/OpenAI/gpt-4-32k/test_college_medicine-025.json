    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide, and a deletion is the removal of one or more nucleotides. So, we are looking for a sequence that has one different nucleotide and one less nucleotide than the original sequence. Option A has a different nucleotide but the same number of nucleotides. Option B has a different nucleotide and one less nucleotide. Option C has the same number of nucleotides but two different nucleotides. Option D has the same nucleotides but one less. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
