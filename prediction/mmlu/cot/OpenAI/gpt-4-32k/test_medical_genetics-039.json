    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epigenetic inheritance refers to the process by which genetic information is not encoded in the DNA sequence itself but is passed on to subsequent generations. This is different from the traditional concept of inheritance, which is often referred to as 'hard inheritance' because it is based on the physical DNA sequence. The term 'soft inheritance' is often used to describe epigenetic inheritance because it is more flexible and can be influenced by environmental factors. Therefore, the epigenetic inheritance system has been described as 'soft inheritance'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. soft inheritance\"}"
