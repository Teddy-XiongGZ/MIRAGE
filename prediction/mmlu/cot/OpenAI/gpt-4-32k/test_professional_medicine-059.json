    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Inguinal hernias in infants and children are due to the persistence of the processus vaginalis, which normally obliterates before birth. This allows abdominal contents to pass into the inguinal canal and sometimes into the scrotum. The risk of incarceration and strangulation is high in infants, especially those younger than 1 year, and therefore, prompt surgical repair (herniorrhaphy) is indicated. Waiting for spontaneous closure or until a certain age is not recommended due to the risk of complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time\"}"
