    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The boy's history of excessive activity, impulsivity (running wildly in the classroom), talkativeness, inattentiveness (forgetting to turn in homework), and frequent accidents suggest a hyperactivity and impulsivity disorder. These symptoms are consistent with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that is inappropriate for the child's age. Conduct disorder is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated. Learning disorders are diagnosed when the individual's achievement on individually administered, standardized tests in reading, mathematics, or written expression is substantially below that expected for age, schooling, and level of intelligence. Seizure disorder or epilepsy is a neurological disorder marked by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, or convulsions, associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The boy's symptoms do not align with these other disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\"}"
