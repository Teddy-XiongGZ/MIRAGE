    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions. They have an optimal pH at which they function best. If an enzyme's activity is constant over a broad range of pH values, it suggests that the enzyme is not sensitive to changes in pH. This would be the case if there were no ionizing groups on the enzyme or substrate, as ionizing groups can gain or lose protons depending on the pH, altering the structure and function of the enzyme or substrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
