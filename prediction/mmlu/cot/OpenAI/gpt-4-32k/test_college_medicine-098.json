    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microtubules are part of the cell's cytoskeleton and are involved in maintaining cell shape, enabling cell motility, and most importantly, they are crucial for intracellular transport and cell division. Cardiac muscle contraction is more related to actin and myosin filaments, not microtubules. Transcription of mRNA from DNA is a nuclear process and does not directly involve microtubules. The Krebs cycle is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the mitochondria and does not involve the cytoskeleton. Meiosis, on the other hand, is a type of cell division that involves the alignment and separation of chromosomes, a process that heavily relies on the microtubule network.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
