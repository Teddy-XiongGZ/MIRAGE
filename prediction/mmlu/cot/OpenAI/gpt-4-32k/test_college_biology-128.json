    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Root pressure is a force or pressure that helps to drive fluids upwards into the plant. It is primarily generated by osmotic pressure in the cells of the roots and is partially responsible for the rise of water in plants. Translocation refers to the movement of materials from leaves to other tissues throughout the plant. Adhesion refers to the property of water to stick to other substances, and capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of external forces like gravity. Therefore, the process that causes water to enter the roots due to root pressure is osmosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
