    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first priority in this situation is patient safety. Allowing a potentially intoxicated physician to continue working could put patients at risk. Asking the physician if he is sober (option A) is not reliable, as he may not be truthful or may not accurately assess his own sobriety. Taking a blood sample (option B) could provide objective evidence of intoxication, but it would not immediately address the potential risk to patients. Letting the physician sleep in his office (option D) does not address the issue of potential substance use and does not ensure that the physician will not return to work while still impaired. The most immediate and effective way to ensure patient safety is to relieve the physician of duty and alert the hospital's patient safety officer (option C). This would remove the potential risk to patients and initiate a process for addressing the physician's potential substance use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
