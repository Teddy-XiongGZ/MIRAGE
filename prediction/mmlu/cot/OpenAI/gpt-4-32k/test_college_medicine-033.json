    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy charge of the cell is not the difference between the charge on the outside and inside of a cell, that's the membrane potential. It's also not generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase, that's the electrochemical gradient. The overall rate of energy use by the cell is the metabolic rate, not the energy charge. The energy charge of a cell is a measure of the energy status of the cell, and it is determined by the extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool (ATP, ADP, AMP) is phosphorylated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
