    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mapping of human chromosomes is not restricted to the sex chromosomes, so option A is incorrect. The number of linkage groups is not about twice the number of chromosomes, so option C is incorrect. It is also not true that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes, as a significant portion of DNA is non-coding, so option D is incorrect. The mapping of human chromosomes has indeed proceeded more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available, which makes sense as these markers would provide more information and detail for the mapping process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
