    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Executive functioning is primarily controlled by the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for complex cognitive behavior, decision making, and moderating social behavior. Substance abuse can cause pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex, leading to diminished executive functioning. Therefore, statement I is correct. Statement II is not necessarily true, as auditory hallucinations are not directly linked to diminished executive functioning or substance abuse. They are more commonly associated with conditions like schizophrenia. Statement III is also correct, as reduced behavioral impulse control is a common symptom of diminished executive functioning. Therefore, the patient is likely to exhibit pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex and reduced behavioral impulse control.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
