    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation suggests that she has normal female secondary sexual characteristics (breast development) but lacks axillary and pubic hair, which are androgen-dependent. This suggests a disorder of androgen action. Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition that results in the partial or complete inability of the cell to respond to androgens. The unresponsiveness of the cell to the presence of androgenic hormones can impair or prevent the masculinization of male genitalia in the developing fetus, as well as the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia typically presents with ambiguous genitalia in newborn females. Ectodermal dysplasia is a group of syndromes deriving from abnormalities of the ectodermal structures, which include the hair, teeth, nails, sweat glands, cranial-facial structure, and hands. A psychiatric disorder would not explain the lack of axillary and pubic hair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Androgen insensitivity\"}"
