    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and then transported to their respective destinations. For most destinations, a single signal peptide is sufficient to direct the protein to its location. However, chloroplasts are unique in that they are thought to have originated from an ancient symbiotic relationship between a primitive eukaryotic cell and a photosynthetic bacterium. As a result, chloroplasts have two membranes, each requiring a different signal peptide for protein targeting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Chloroplast\"}"
