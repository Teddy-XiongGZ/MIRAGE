    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The src oncogene is a gene that can lead to cancer when it is mutated or expressed at high levels. An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. In tumor cells, these genes are often mutated or expressed at high levels. The src oncogene encodes a protein known as a tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that can transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a protein in a cell. This process is known as phosphorylation. Phosphorylation can change the function or activity of a protein, often in a way that promotes cell division and growth. Therefore, the src oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tyrosine kinase\"}"
