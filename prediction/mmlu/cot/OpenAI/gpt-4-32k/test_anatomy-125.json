    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cervical sympathetic chain is responsible for the sympathetic innervation of the head and neck. Damage to this chain can result in a condition known as Horner's syndrome. The symptoms of Horner's syndrome include ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), miosis (pupillary constriction), anhidrosis (decreased sweating), and vasodilation of facial vessels due to the loss of sympathetic tone. However, the sympathetic chain does not control lacrimation, which is under parasympathetic control. Therefore, decreased lacrimation would not be a symptom of damage to the cervical sympathetic chain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pupillary constriction and vasodilation of facial vessels\"}"
