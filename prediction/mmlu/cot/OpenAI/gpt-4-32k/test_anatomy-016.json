    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During quiet inspiration, the primary muscles involved are the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. The diaphragm contracts and moves downward, increasing the vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity. The external intercostal muscles lift the ribs up and out, increasing the anteroposterior and transverse dimensions of the thoracic cavity. The internal intercostal muscles are primarily involved in forced expiration, not quiet inspiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm\"}"
