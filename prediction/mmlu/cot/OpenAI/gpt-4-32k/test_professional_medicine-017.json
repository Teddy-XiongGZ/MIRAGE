    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a process where DNA is amplified using specific oligonucleotides, a thermostable DNA polymerase, and repetitive cycles of heating and cooling. This is the process of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), which is used to amplify specific DNA sequences. Northern blotting is used to study RNA, not DNA. Reverse transcription is the process of creating DNA from an RNA template, which is not described in the scenario. Southern blotting is a method used to detect a specific DNA sequence in a DNA sample, but it does not involve amplification of the DNA sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Polymerase chain reaction\"}"
