    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose to produce energy, which can result in the production of acidic byproducts and thus lower the pH within the cell. An intracellular buffer would need to be able to absorb these excess hydrogen ions to prevent drastic changes in pH. Glutamine is an amino acid and does not have buffering capacity. Glucose is the substrate for glycolysis and does not act as a buffer. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars and does not have buffering capacity. Carnosine, however, is a dipeptide molecule that is known to act as an intracellular buffer, particularly in muscle cells where the rate of glycolysis can be high during exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Carnosine\"}"
