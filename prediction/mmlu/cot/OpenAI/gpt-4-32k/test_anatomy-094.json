    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A lateral excursion of the mandible is a movement where the lower jaw moves to the side. If the mandible is moving to the right, it means that the muscles on the left side of the jaw are contracting to pull the jaw to the right. The lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for moving the jaw side to side. Therefore, the left lateral pterygoid muscle would be the most active during a right lateral excursion of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Left lateral pterygoid muscle\"}"
