    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome and are caused by radiation, viruses, transposons and mutagenic chemicals, as well as errors that occur during meiosis or DNA replication. They can also be induced by the organism itself, by cellular processes such as hypermutation. Mutation can result in several different types of change in DNA sequences; these can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely. Most mutations have no effect on the organism's phenotype, these are called neutral mutations. Some mutations can be beneficial but they are rare. Deleterious mutations can cause genetic disorders or cancer. Mutations are not related to being present in homozygotes or heterozygotes, it's about the change in the DNA sequence. Allozyme studies can detect some mutations but not all, so it's not the most common feature of mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
