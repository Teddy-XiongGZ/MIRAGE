    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a modification in an RNA strand that normally produces a transmembrane protein. The modification is a single nucleotide change. This is known as a point mutation. Depending on where this mutation occurs, it could either have no effect (if it's a silent mutation), or it could change the amino acid sequence of the protein (missense mutation), or it could introduce a stop codon (nonsense mutation). The question does not specify where in the sequence the change occurs, so we cannot determine if it's a silent, missense, or nonsense mutation. However, since the question implies a change, it's likely not a silent mutation. A nonsense mutation would result in a shorter protein, not mentioned in the options. Therefore, the most likely outcome is a missense mutation, which would result in a protein of the same size, but with a different amino acid sequence, potentially making it dysfunctional.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein\"}"
