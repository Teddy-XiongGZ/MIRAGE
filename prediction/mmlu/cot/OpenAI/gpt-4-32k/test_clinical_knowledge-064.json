    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A palpable left parasternal impulse is typically associated with an enlarged right ventricle. This is because the right ventricle lies immediately beneath the sternum, and any enlargement or hypertrophy of the right ventricle can cause a palpable impulse in the left parasternal area. Aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation are more likely to cause a palpable impulse in the aortic area, which is located in the second right intercostal space. Left ventricular hypertrophy is more likely to cause a palpable impulse in the apex of the heart, which is located in the fifth intercostal space in the midclavicular line.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Right ventricular hypertrophy\"}"
