    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Embryonic cleavage refers to the division of cells in the early embryo. Let's go through the options one by one. A. The presence of yolk does inhibit cleavage, particularly in the vegetal pole where the yolk is concentrated. B. Telolecithal eggs, which have a large amount of yolk, do undergo meroblastic cleavage, where only a portion of the egg divides. D. The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage do directly give rise to blastomeres, which are the cells formed by cleavage. C. However, the vegetal pole, which contains more yolk, does not undergo cleavage more readily than the animal pole. In fact, it's the opposite: the animal pole, which contains less yolk, undergoes cleavage more readily.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
