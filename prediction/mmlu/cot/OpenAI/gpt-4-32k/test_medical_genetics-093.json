    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Twin studies are a valuable tool in genetics research because they allow scientists to estimate the relative influence of genes and environment on individual traits. This is because identical twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins share about 50% of their genes, just like any other siblings. Therefore, any differences in traits between identical twins can be attributed to environmental factors, while differences between fraternal twins can be due to both genetic and environmental factors. The other options are not correct because twin studies do not facilitate gene cloning, improve gene expression, or increase the likelihood of being heterozygous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
