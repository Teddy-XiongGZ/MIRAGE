    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of progressive weakness, inability to perform activities that require muscle strength, and characteristic skin findings suggest a diagnosis of dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune condition that affects the skin and muscles, causing a distinctive rash and muscle weakness. The rash often appears on the face, eyelids, and knuckles, and is described as a purple-red or heliotrope discoloration. The muscle weakness is typically symmetrical and affects the proximal muscles, making tasks like climbing stairs or combing hair difficult. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy usually presents earlier in life and does not involve a rash. Eczema would not cause muscle weakness. Lyme disease could cause muscle weakness, but the rash and other symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Dermatomyositis\"}"
