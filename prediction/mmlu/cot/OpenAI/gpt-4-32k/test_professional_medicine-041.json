    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of syncope while walking, along with the physical exam findings of a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the neck, are indicative of aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis can cause syncope during exertion due to the heart's inability to adequately increase cardiac output. Aortic insufficiency typically presents with a diastolic murmur, not a systolic one. Mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis typically present with murmurs best heard at the apex of the heart, not the right upper sternal border.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. aortic stenosis\"}"
