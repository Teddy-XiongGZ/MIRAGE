    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pupillary light reflex is the process by which the pupil of the eye constricts in response to light. The afferent limb of this reflex is carried by the optic nerve, not the oculomotor nerve, so option D is incorrect. The efferent limb is carried by the oculomotor nerve, not the optic nerve, so option A is also incorrect. The inferior colliculi in the midbrain are involved in auditory processing, not visual, so option B is incorrect. The pupillary light reflex is indeed a consensual reflex, meaning that when one eye is exposed to light, both pupils constrict. Therefore, option C is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
