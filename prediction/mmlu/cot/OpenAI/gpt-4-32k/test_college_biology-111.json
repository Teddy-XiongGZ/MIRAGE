    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Evolution is a process that results in changes in the genetic material of a population over time. It is driven by mechanisms such as mutation, non-random mating, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. For evolution to occur, there must be a change in the frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool over successive generations. This is because evolution is a generational process, not something that happens within an organism's lifetime. Therefore, the frequencies of alleles in a population's gene pool remaining constant over successive generations or changing during an organism's lifetime would not indicate evolution. Similarly, the frequencies of each allele in an organism's genotype remaining constant within the organism's lifetime would not indicate evolution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
