    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The aorta is the main and largest artery in the human body, originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen. However, it carries oxygenated blood away from the heart, not to it. The carotid arteries are major blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain, neck, and face. They also carry oxygenated blood away from the heart. The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body into the right atrium of the heart. Therefore, it does not carry oxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins are the only veins in the body that carry oxygenated blood. They transport oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Pulmonary veins\"}"
