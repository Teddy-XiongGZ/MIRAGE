    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a stillborn with oligohydramnios and absence of a urethral opening. Oligohydramnios is a condition characterized by a deficiency of amniotic fluid. It can occur due to various reasons, one of which is renal agenesis, where the fetus's kidneys do not develop properly. The kidneys produce the majority of amniotic fluid in the second half of pregnancy, so their absence or dysfunction can lead to oligohydramnios. The absence of a urethral opening in the stillborn suggests a urinary tract obstruction, which could also lead to decreased amniotic fluid production. The lack of amniotic fluid can cause compression of the developing fetus, leading to a condition known as Potter sequence. One of the key features of Potter sequence is pulmonary hypoplasia, or underdevelopment of the lungs, due to the lack of space for the lungs to expand and grow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pulmonary hypoplasia\"}"
