    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Systemic Sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a chronic connective tissue disease generally classified as one of the autoimmune rheumatic diseases. It is characterized by changes in the skin, blood vessels, muscles, and internal organs. It's not true that it affects males more than females, in fact, it's more common in females. Telangiectasia can be seen in many conditions, not just systemic sclerosis, so it doesn't clinch the diagnosis. Arachnodactyly is a feature of Marfan syndrome, not systemic sclerosis. Patients with systemic sclerosis can have changes in their skin, which can become hard and tight, but a beaked shaped nose is not a typical feature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
