    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitochondria are present in all eukaryotic cells, including plants, animals, and fungi. They are responsible for producing energy through the process of cellular respiration. Chloroplasts, on the other hand, are only found in plant cells and some algae. They are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy. Therefore, plants have both mitochondria and chloroplasts, while animals and fungi only have mitochondria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
