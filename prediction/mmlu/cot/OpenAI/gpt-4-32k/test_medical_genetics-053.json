    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Plasmid vectors are small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules that are distinct from a cell's chromosomal DNA. They are used in genetic engineering to amplify, or make many copies of, certain genes. They can accommodate inserts of DNA, but not as large as 100 kilobases. They do not include centromeres, which are a feature of eukaryotic chromosomes, not prokaryotic plasmids. They do grow within bacteria and are present in bacterial colonies on an agar plate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
