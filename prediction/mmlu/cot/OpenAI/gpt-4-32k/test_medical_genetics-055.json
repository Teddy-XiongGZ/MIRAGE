    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lac operon is a set of genes in E. coli that are involved in the metabolism of lactose. The operon is normally turned off, or repressed, when lactose is not present. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon and prevents transcription of the genes. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor and changes its shape, preventing it from binding to the operator and allowing transcription to occur. If a mutation prevents the repressor from binding to lactose, the repressor will always be able to bind to the operator, regardless of whether lactose is present or not. This means that the genes will not be transcribed, even when lactose is present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
