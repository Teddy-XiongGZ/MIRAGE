    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport in plants involves proton pumps. Proton pumps are a type of active transport mechanism, which means they require energy to function. This energy is typically provided by ATP. The process does not depend on DNA, as it is not a genetic process. It also does not translocate starch, but rather, it translocates sugars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
