    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Recombinant alpha-iduronidase is an enzyme replacement therapy. Each of the diseases listed is a type of lysosomal storage disorder, but they each involve a deficiency of a different enzyme. Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A, Gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase. Hurler syndrome, on the other hand, is caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, so recombinant alpha-iduronidase would be used to treat this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
