    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process by which H+ ions return to the inside of the mitochondria is facilitated by ATP synthase, which allows the ions to move down their concentration gradient. This movement does not require energy, which means it is a passive process. However, it is not just simple diffusion because it involves a specific channel protein (ATP synthase). Therefore, it is a type of passive transport known as facilitated diffusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Passive transport\"}"
