    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, pancreatitis, thick nasal secretions, and salty sweat are all indicative of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease or trait to develop. The patient has been found to have one detectable mutation (G551D) in the CFTR gene, which is associated with CF. However, the test used only checks for the 36 most common mutations, and it's possible that the patient has a less common mutation in the other CFTR allele that was not detected by this test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained\"}"
