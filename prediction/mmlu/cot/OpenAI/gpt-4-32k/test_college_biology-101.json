    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae are both photosynthetic organisms, but they belong to different domains of life. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes, meaning they lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Green unicellular algae, on the other hand, are eukaryotes, which means they have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Both cyanobacteria and green algae have cell walls, and both can produce cell membranes. Cyanobacteria do not reduce sulfur compounds as a general characteristic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\"}"
