    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the evolutionary relationship between Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria. The fact that both Eukarya and Archaea utilize similar transcription factors (TBP and TFIIB) that Bacteria do not suggests that Eukarya and Archaea share a more recent common ancestor with each other than either does with Bacteria. This would mean that the common ancestor of Eukarya and Archaea diverged from Bacteria first, and then Eukarya and Archaea diverged from each other.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
