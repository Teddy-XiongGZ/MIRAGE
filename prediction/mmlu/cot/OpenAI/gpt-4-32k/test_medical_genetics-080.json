    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neural tube defects can be diagnosed using several methods. Amniocentesis can detect neural tube defects by analyzing the amniotic fluid for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a substance that can be high in cases of neural tube defects. Chorion villus sampling (CVS) can also be used to detect genetic abnormalities, including neural tube defects. Maternal serum screening, specifically the quadruple screen, can detect high levels of AFP which may indicate a neural tube defect. Ultrasonography, particularly a detailed second trimester ultrasound, can visualize the fetus and detect physical abnormalities such as neural tube defects. Therefore, all of these diagnostic techniques are valuable for the diagnosis of neural tube defects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
