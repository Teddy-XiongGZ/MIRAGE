    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Jaundice is a condition that causes yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels. Let's analyze the options. Option A is incorrect because pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of obstructive jaundice, not haemolytic anaemia. Option B is also incorrect because bilirubin is a waste product from the breakdown of red blood cells, not used in their synthesis. Option D is incorrect because it's mandatory to label blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice as a potential infection risk. However, option C is correct. Itching can indeed be a symptom of obstructive jaundice due to the accumulation of bile salts under the skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
