    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gene flow refers to the transfer of genetic variation from one population to another. If genes are moved between populations, that's gene flow. This can increase the genetic diversity of the receiving population, but it can also make the two populations more similar to each other, or more homogeneous. It does not necessarily increase the rate of deleterious mutations, nor does it increase the likelihood of speciation. In fact, it can prevent speciation by keeping the populations genetically similar. It can disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which assumes no gene flow, but the most direct and certain effect is an increase in genetic homogeneity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
