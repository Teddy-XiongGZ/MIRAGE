    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The brain's ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity is not related to the amplitude of the action potential, as this remains constant. The threshold potential also does not vary with stimulus intensity. The number of synapses crossed is not directly related to stimulus intensity. However, the number of action potentials per second, or the frequency of action potentials, does increase with increasing stimulus intensity. This is how the brain can differentiate between a light touch and a hard push, for example.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
