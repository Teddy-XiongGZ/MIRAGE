    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A peripheral motor nerve injury would lead to loss of innervation to the muscles it supplies. This would mean that the muscles are not receiving the necessary signals for contraction and movement. Over time, without these signals, the muscles would begin to waste away or atrophy due to disuse. Spastic paralysis is usually associated with central nervous system damage, not peripheral. Flaccid paralysis could be a result immediately after the injury, but over time, the muscle would atrophy. Contracture is a condition of abnormal shortening of muscle tissue, which is not the case here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. atrophy\"}"
