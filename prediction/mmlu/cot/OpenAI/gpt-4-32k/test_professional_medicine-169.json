    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. When DNA damage is detected, p53 will halt the cell cycle in the G1 phase to allow for DNA repair. If the damage is too severe, p53 can trigger apoptosis to prevent the propagation of potentially cancerous cells. In this case, the patient's tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene, leading to an inactive gene product. This means that the cells would not be able to halt the cell cycle for DNA repair or trigger apoptosis, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Therefore, the defect in cell cycle arrest due to the inactive p53 gene product would most likely occur in the G1 phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
