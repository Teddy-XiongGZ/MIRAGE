    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The transmembrane domain of a protein is the part that spans the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. This region is hydrophobic, meaning it repels water. Therefore, the amino acids in this region are typically nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acids. Looking at the options, glycine is a nonpolar amino acid, but it is not as hydrophobic as some others. Tyrosine is a polar amino acid due to its hydroxyl group, and arginine is a basic amino acid, which makes it polar and hydrophilic. Isoleucine, however, is a nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acid, making it the most likely to be found in the transmembrane domain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Isoleucine\"}"
