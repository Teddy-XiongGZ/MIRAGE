    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitral regurgitation is characterized by a pan-systolic murmur, which is present in all options. A displaced apex beat is also common in mitral regurgitation due to left ventricular enlargement, which is present in options A, B, and C. The first heart sound is usually soft in mitral regurgitation, which is present in option A. A mid-diastolic murmur is suggestive of mitral stenosis, which would be part of a mixed mitral valve disease. The length of the mid-diastolic murmur can vary, but a short mid-diastolic murmur is more suggestive of a predominance of mitral regurgitation over stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
