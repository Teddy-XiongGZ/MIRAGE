    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes do not properly align with each other when looking at an object. A medially directed strabismus means the eye is deviated towards the nose. The muscles that control this movement are the lateral rectus, which abducts the eye, and the medial rectus, which adducts the eye. The oculomotor nerve innervates the medial rectus, while the abducens nerve innervates the lateral rectus. If there is medial strabismus, it means the eye is not being abduced properly, which would suggest a problem with the abducens nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. abducens nerve.\"}"
