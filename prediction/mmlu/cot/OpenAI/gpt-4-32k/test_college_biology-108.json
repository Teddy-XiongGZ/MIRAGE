    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Marine birds drink seawater, which is high in salt. To maintain their internal osmolarity, they need to get rid of the excess salt. They can't do this through urine alone because it would require a lot of water, which they don't have access to. Therefore, they must have a specialized mechanism to excrete salt. The question is whether they excrete only salt or also nitrogenous wastes. Nitrogenous wastes are typically excreted through the kidneys, not the nasal glands. Therefore, the most likely answer is that they excrete salts through specialized salt-exchange glands and excrete small volumes of urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
