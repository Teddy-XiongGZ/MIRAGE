    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of agitation and aggression could be indicative of a hyperactive dopamine system. This could be due to an excess of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, or an increased sensitivity of the dopamine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane. However, the options provided do not include an increase in dopamine or increased sensitivity of the receptors. Decreased dopamine or decreased receptors would likely result in symptoms of dopamine deficiency, such as Parkinson's disease. Cell death in areas with high dopamine cells could also lead to a decrease in dopamine, not an increase. Seizure-like activity in the dopamine brain areas is not typically associated with aggression and agitation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. There are decreased dopamine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane.\"}"
