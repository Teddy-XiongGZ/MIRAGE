    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates in the subarachnoid space, which is located between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The dura mater is the outermost layer, followed by the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater is the innermost layer that is directly attached to the brain and spinal cord. Therefore, the CSF does not circulate between the skull and dura mater or the dura mater and arachnoid mater. It also does not circulate between the pia mater and the brain surface because the pia mater is directly attached to the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. arachnoid and pia maters.\"}"
