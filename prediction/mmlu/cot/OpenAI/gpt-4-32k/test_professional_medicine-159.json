    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the risk of death from cancer in both groups. The risk is calculated as the number of events (in this case, deaths from cancer) divided by the total number of individuals in the group. For the group that received Drug X, the risk is 100/200 = 0.5. For the group that did not receive Drug X, the risk is 100/400 = 0.25. The relative risk is then calculated as the risk in the exposed group (those who received Drug X) divided by the risk in the unexposed group (those who did not receive Drug X). So, the relative risk is 0.5/0.25 = 2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer\"}"
