    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adaptations of plants to minimize water loss in high-temperature environments would involve mechanisms that reduce evaporation. Numerous stomata (A) would actually increase water loss because stomata are the pores through which plants lose water. Thin cuticles (B) would also increase water loss because the cuticle is a waxy layer that prevents water loss. Large surface-to-volume ratios (D) would also increase water loss because a larger surface area would mean more area for water to evaporate from. Spines instead of leaves (C), however, would reduce water loss. This is because spines have a smaller surface area than leaves, reducing the area from which water can evaporate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
