    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation that improve with bowel movements and worsen with stress (eg, preparing for examinations) are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with predominant constipation (IBS-C). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. The diagnosis is clinical, based on Rome IV criteria, which require recurrent abdominal pain at least 1 day/week in the last 3 months associated with 2 or more of the following: related to defecation, associated with a change in stool frequency, or associated with a change in stool form. The patient's normal physical examination and laboratory studies, including negative urease breath test and normal endoscopies, are consistent with IBS, as IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion, accelerating small bowel and colonic transit, which can help alleviate constipation in IBS-C. Azathioprine and infliximab are used in inflammatory bowel disease, not IBS. Mesalamine is used in inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Lubiprostone\"}"
