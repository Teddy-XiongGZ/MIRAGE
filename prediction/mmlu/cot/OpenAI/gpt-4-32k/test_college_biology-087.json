    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sexual dimorphism refers to the differences in appearance between males and females of the same species. This can include differences in size, color, and the presence of physical features such as antlers or feathers. In primates, a high degree of sexual dimorphism usually indicates intense competition between males. This competition is not typically for food resources, as primates often share food resources within their social groups. Instead, the competition is usually for mates, as the males with the most desirable traits are more likely to attract females and pass on their genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. males in order to obtain mates\"}"
