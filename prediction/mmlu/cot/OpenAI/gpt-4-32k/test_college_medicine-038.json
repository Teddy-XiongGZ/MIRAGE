    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle contraction is a complex process that involves several steps. The power stroke is one of these steps, and it is the phase where the muscle fiber shortens. This process requires ATP. However, the question asks for another process that also requires ATP. Tropomyosin-troponin interaction, myosin-actin interaction, and calcium-troponin interaction are all important in muscle contraction, but they do not directly require ATP. On the other hand, the detachment of myosin from actin at the end of the power stroke requires ATP. Therefore, the answer should be myosin-actin detachment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
