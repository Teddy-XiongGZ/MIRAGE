    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A nucleosome is a basic unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes, consisting of a segment of DNA wound around eight histone proteins (two each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), and is connected by linker DNA. The H1 histone is associated with the linker DNA. When a nucleosome dimer is digested to nucleosome monomers by DNase, the target is the linker DNA that connects the two nucleosomes, not the histones or the nucleosome core itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. linker DNA\"}"
