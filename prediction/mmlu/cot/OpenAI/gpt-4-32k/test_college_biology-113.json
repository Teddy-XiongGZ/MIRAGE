    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where the rate of a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme (alcohol dehydrogenase) increases with the concentration of the substrate (acetaldehyde) until it reaches a maximum rate. This is a typical characteristic of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and is described by the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. When the reaction rate reaches its maximum, it means that all the active sites of the enzyme molecules are occupied by the substrate. This is known as enzyme saturation. At this point, adding more substrate won't increase the reaction rate because there are no free enzyme molecules to interact with the extra substrate. The activation energy of the reaction, the change in free energy, and the specificity of the enzyme for its substrate do not change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
