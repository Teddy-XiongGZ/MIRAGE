    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of low back pain radiating down the leg, which started after lifting a heavy object, along with a positive straight-leg raise test and loss of right ankle reflex, are indicative of sciatica. Sciatica is most commonly caused by herniation of the lumbar intervertebral disc, which leads to compression of the nerve root, most commonly L5 or S1. This herniation is due to displacement of the nucleus pulposus, the gel-like substance in the center of the intervertebral disc. Hypertrophy of the facet joints, osteophyte formation, and spondylolisthesis can also cause back pain, but they are less likely to cause the radicular symptoms seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Displacement of the nucleus pulposus\"}"
