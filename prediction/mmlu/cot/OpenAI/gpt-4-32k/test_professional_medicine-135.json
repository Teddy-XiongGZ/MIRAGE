    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of unconsciousness, erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs, along with a significantly elevated creatine kinase activity, suggests a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. This condition is often caused by prolonged immobilization, which can occur in cases of drug overdose, as suggested by the positive urine toxicology screening for opiates and cocaine. Rhabdomyolysis leads to the release of muscle cell contents, including myoglobin, into the circulation. Myoglobin is toxic to the renal tubules and can lead to acute tubular necrosis, a form of acute kidney injury. The presence of pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes in the urine further supports this diagnosis, as these are signs of renal tubular damage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Acute tubular necrosis\"}"
