    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of pain at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity suggest a problem with one of the rotator cuff muscles. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. The supraspinatus muscle is the most commonly injured rotator cuff muscle and is responsible for the initial 15 degrees of arm abduction. The anterior scalene, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis minor are not part of the rotator cuff and are not primarily responsible for arm abduction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. supraspinatus\"}"
