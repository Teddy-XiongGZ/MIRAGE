    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A peroxisomal disorder is a condition that affects the peroxisomes, which are small organelles within cells that help to break down fatty acids and other substances. Acute intermittent porphyria is a disorder of heme biosynthesis, not peroxisomes. Maple syrup urine disease is a metabolic disorder that affects the breakdown of certain amino acids, not peroxisomes. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder that affects the breakdown of certain fats, but it is a mitochondrial disorder, not a peroxisomal disorder. Zellweger syndrome, on the other hand, is a peroxisomal disorder characterized by the reduction or absence of functional peroxisomes in the cells of an individual.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
