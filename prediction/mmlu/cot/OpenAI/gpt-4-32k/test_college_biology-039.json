    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The statement 'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' (choice A) is a theory that has been largely discredited in modern biology. It suggests that an organism's development (ontogeny) repeats (recapitulates) its evolutionary history (phylogeny), which is not entirely accurate. Choice B is also incorrect because early embryos do not display identical features of their class, order, and species. They do, however, share some common features, which leads us to choice C. Early human embryos do have features in common with early fish and avian embryos, such as the presence of a notochord, pharyngeal arches, and a tail. Finally, choice D is incorrect because a human embryo does not display features of adult fish and birds in the course of its development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
