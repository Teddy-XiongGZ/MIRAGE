    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The intensity of exercise determines the type of energy production the body uses. At lower intensities, the body primarily uses aerobic energy production, which includes the TCA cycle and the electron transfer chain. However, as the intensity of exercise increases, the body cannot produce energy fast enough through aerobic means, so it begins to rely more heavily on anaerobic energy production. Therefore, the higher the intensity of exercise, the greater the proportional contribution of anaerobic energy production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
