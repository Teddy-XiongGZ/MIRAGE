    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diplopia, or double vision, can occur even if one eye is covered, so option A is incorrect. The false image in diplopia is not always the outer image, it can be either, so option B is incorrect. A fourth nerve palsy, also known as trochlear nerve palsy, primarily affects the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for downward, inward eye movement, not upward, so option C is incorrect. A sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, affects the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for outward eye movement. If this muscle is paralyzed, the eye will deviate medially, causing a convergent squint, not a divergent squint, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
