    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"R-selected species are those that emphasize high growth rates, typically exploit less-crowded ecological niches, and produce many offspring, each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood. Therefore, they have a high reproductive rate (option A), they are usually small in size (option B), and they occupy unstable environments (option C). However, they do not have a high competitive ability (option D) because they focus on rapid reproduction and growth rather than competition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
