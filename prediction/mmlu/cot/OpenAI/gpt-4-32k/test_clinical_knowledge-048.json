    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen breakdown, also known as glycogenolysis, occurs in the muscles during exercise to provide a quick source of energy. Insulin is a hormone that promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen, so it would not activate glycogen breakdown. Cortisol is a stress hormone that does promote glycogenolysis, but it's not the primary activator in exercising muscles. Increased pH would not activate glycogen breakdown, as it is not directly related to energy production. Therefore, none of the options provided are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. none of the above.\"}"
