    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The female reproductive tract in mammals starts with the ovary, where the eggs are produced. The eggs then travel through the oviduct, also known as the fallopian tube, to the uterus. If fertilization occurs, the fertilized egg implants in the uterus. The vagina is the final part of the tract, serving as the birth canal and the route for menstrual flow. The rete and epididymis are parts of the male reproductive system, not the female.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Ovary, oviduct, uterus, vagina\"}"
