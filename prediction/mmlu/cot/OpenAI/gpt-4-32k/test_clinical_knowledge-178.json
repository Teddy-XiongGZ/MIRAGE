    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts. They speed up chemical reactions in a cell. Enzyme activity can be affected by a variety of factors. Temperature can affect enzyme activity because enzymes have an optimal temperature at which they function best. If the temperature is too high or too low, the enzyme can denature and lose its function. pH can also affect enzyme activity because enzymes have an optimal pH at which they function best. If the pH is too high or too low, the enzyme can denature and lose its function. The presence of certain metal ions can also affect enzyme activity. Some enzymes require certain metal ions to function properly. If these metal ions are not present, the enzyme may not be able to carry out its function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
