    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing a rapid heart rate, or tachycardia. The goal is to slow down the heart rate. Digoxin is used for rate control in atrial fibrillation but it has a slow onset of action and is not suitable for acute situations. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension and heart failure, but it does not directly affect heart rate. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic for ventricular arrhythmias, not atrial. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to slow the heart rate in atrial fibrillation. The patient has already received metoprolol and it initially worked, but the heart rate has increased again. Therefore, additional metoprolol should be administered.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Metoprolol\"}"
