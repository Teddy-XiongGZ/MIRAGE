    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a blistering skin disorder. The fact that the blisters do not break easily indicates that the adhesion failure is likely occurring deeper in the skin, rather than at the level of the epidermis. Langerhans cells and melanocytes are located in the epidermis, so they can be ruled out. Dermal papillae are part of the dermis and are involved in the formation of the dermal-epidermal junction, but they are not directly involved in cell adhesion. The basement membrane, on the other hand, is a layer that separates the epidermis from the dermis and is involved in cell adhesion. Therefore, a failure in the adhesion of the basement membrane could lead to the formation of blisters.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Basement membrane\"}"
