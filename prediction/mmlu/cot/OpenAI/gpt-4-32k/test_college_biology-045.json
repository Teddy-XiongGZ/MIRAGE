    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Introns are noncoding regions of DNA that are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain, so options B and C are characteristics of introns. They are also excised from the primary transcript before it gains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A)tail, so option D is also a characteristic of introns. However, introns are not exclusive to eukaryotes. While they are more common in eukaryotes, some prokaryotes also have introns, so option A is not a characteristic of introns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
