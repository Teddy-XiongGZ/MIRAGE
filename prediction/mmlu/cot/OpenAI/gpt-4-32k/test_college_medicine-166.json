    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine is used for short, high-intensity efforts. These energy systems are anaerobic, meaning they do not require oxygen to produce energy. However, they are limited in duration because the body has a limited store of ATP and phosphocreatine. The ATP-PCr energy system can sustain maximal effort for about 5-10 seconds before it is depleted and other energy systems need to take over.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
