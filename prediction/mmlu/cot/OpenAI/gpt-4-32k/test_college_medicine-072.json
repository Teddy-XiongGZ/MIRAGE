    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water is due to the fact that solid water (ice) is less dense than liquid water. This is because of the hydrogen bonds that form a crystalline structure in ice, which takes up more space and therefore has a lower density than liquid water. This is why ice floats on water. So, the answer should be the one that states that solid water has a lower density than liquid water due to the hydrogen bonds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
