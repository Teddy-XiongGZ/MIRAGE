    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the red fox is a major predator of hares. If the fox population decreases due to the mange mite, there will be fewer predators for the hares. This would likely lead to an increase in the hare population as there are fewer threats to their survival. Therefore, as mite population sizes increase, fox populations would decrease and hare populations would increase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.\"}"
