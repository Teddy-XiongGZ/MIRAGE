    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Starling forces that determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR) include the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, and the filtration coefficient. If the efferent arteriole is constricted, this would increase the resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus. As a result, more blood would be 'backed up' in the glomerulus, leading to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries. This would increase the driving force for filtration, potentially increasing the GFR. The filtration coefficient and oncotic pressure would not be directly affected by this change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased hydrostatic pressure\"}"
