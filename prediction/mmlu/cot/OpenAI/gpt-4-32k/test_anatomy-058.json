    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A dendrite is a part of a neuron that receives signals, but it is not the point where an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another. Glial cells are non-neuronal cells in the brain that provide support and protection for neurons, but they do not transmit impulses. A nerve center is a group of nerve cells, but it is not the point where an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another. A synapse, however, is the junction between two neurons where the impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Synapse\"}"
