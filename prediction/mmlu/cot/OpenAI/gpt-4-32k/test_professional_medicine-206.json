    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and fever, along with the finding of intracellular inclusion bodies in the transplanted kidney, suggest a viral infection. The patient's leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and elevated creatinine level indicate that the infection is affecting his immune system and kidney function. Cyclosporine and corticosteroids are immunosuppressive drugs, so increasing their dosage would likely worsen the infection. Amphotericin is an antifungal medication, which would not be effective against a viral infection. Ganciclovir, however, is an antiviral medication that is often used to treat infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common cause of disease in immunosuppressed patients, including organ transplant recipients. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to begin ganciclovir therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
