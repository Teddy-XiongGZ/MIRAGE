    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cellular uptake of cholesterol involves the binding of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol complexes to cell-surface receptors. This is followed by endosome formation, which is a part of the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Adhesion plaques, however, are involved in cell-to-cell adhesion and do not play a role in cholesterol uptake.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
