    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tall violet plant has the genotype DDWw, which means it has two dominant alleles for height (D) and one dominant and one recessive allele for color (Ww). The dwarf white plant, on the other hand, must have two recessive alleles for both traits, so its genotype is ddww. When these two plants cross, all of the offspring will receive a dominant D allele from the tall parent, making them all tall. For the color, half of the offspring will receive a dominant W allele from the tall parent and half will receive a recessive w allele, making half of them violet and half white. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
