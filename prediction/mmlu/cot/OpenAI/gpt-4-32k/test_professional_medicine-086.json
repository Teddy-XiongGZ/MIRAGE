    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, a widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration, and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. Aortic stenosis typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur, but it is usually heard best at the right upper sternal border and does not cause a widely split S2. Coarctation of the aorta usually presents with a systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border, but it also does not cause a widely split S2. Mitral valve prolapse usually presents with a mid-systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur, not a mid-diastolic murmur. An atrial septal defect, however, can cause a widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration, a systolic ejection murmur due to increased flow across the pulmonary valve, and a mid-diastolic murmur due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Atrial septal defect\"}"
