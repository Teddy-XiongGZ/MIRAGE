    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. It is typically caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. However, in this case, the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother does not change the amino acid at that locus, meaning it is a silent mutation. Furthermore, the same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. This suggests that the nucleotide change is not disease-causing but rather a common variation in the gene sequence that does not cause any apparent changes to the protein's function. This is known as a polymorphism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. It is a polymorphism\"}"
