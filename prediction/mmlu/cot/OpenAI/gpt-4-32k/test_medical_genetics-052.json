    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Positional cloning is a method used to identify and clone a gene based on its location on a chromosome. It does not involve using a selection procedure to clone a cDNA, which is option A. It also does not involve cloning a portion of a gene using PCR, which is option B. Nor does it involve isolating a gene by PCR using primers from another species, which is option C. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, which correctly describes the process of positional cloning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
