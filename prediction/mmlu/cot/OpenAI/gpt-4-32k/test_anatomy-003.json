    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ectomesenchyme is a form of mesenchyme that arises from the neural crest during embryonic development. It gives rise to various structures in the body, particularly those in the head and neck region. Motor neurons are derived from the neural tube, not the neural crest, so option A is incorrect. Skeletal muscles are derived from the mesoderm, not the ectomesenchyme, so option B is incorrect. Sweat glands are derived from the ectoderm, not the ectomesenchyme, so option D is incorrect. Melanocytes, however, are derived from the neural crest, and therefore the ectomesenchyme, making option C the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
