    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the body's main stress response system. The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol. When cortisol levels in the blood reach a certain threshold, it inhibits the release of CRF and ACTH, thus suppressing further cortisol production. This is known as a negative feedback loop.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Negative feedback loop of cortisol.\"}"
