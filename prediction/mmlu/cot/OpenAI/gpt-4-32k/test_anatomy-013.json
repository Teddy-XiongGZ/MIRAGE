    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Therefore, if there is damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the cricothyroid muscle would still be functional. The interarytenoid muscles, which are responsible for adduction of the vocal folds, would be weak due to the nerve damage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. cricothyroid muscle is still functional but the interarytenoids are weak.\"}"
