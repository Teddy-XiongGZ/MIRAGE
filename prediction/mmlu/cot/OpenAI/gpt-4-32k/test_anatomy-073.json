    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandible, or lower jaw, is the bone that forms the lower part of the skull, and it's often subject to fractures. When a fracture occurs, the muscles attached to the mandible can cause displacement of the fragments. The digastric muscle, which is attached to the anterior or front part of the mandible, pulls it upwards and backwards. The lateral pterygoid muscle, which is attached to the posterior or back part of the mandible, pulls it forwards. The temporalis muscle, which is also attached to the posterior part of the mandible, pulls it upwards and backwards. The medial pterygoid muscle, which is attached to the medial or inner part of the mandible, pulls it upwards and forwards. Therefore, in an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible, the posterior fragment would be displaced anteriorly by the action of the lateral pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
