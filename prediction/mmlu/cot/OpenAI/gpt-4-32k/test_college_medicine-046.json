    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This scenario is describing a psychological test known as the 'Strange Situation' developed by Mary Ainsworth to assess attachment styles in children. The child's behavior when the mother leaves and returns provides insight into their attachment style. Decreased exploration when the mother is out of the room (Choice A) is a normal reaction, as the child may feel insecure without their primary caregiver. Crying and returning to the mother upon return (Choice B) is also a normal reaction, as it shows the child missed their mother and seeks comfort from her. Exploring the room before the mother leaves (Choice D) is a sign of a secure attachment, as the child feels safe to explore their environment with their caregiver present. However, avoiding the mother upon return (Choice C) is a concerning sign. This could indicate an insecure attachment style, specifically avoidant attachment, where the child learns to suppress their needs and emotions as they do not expect them to be met.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
