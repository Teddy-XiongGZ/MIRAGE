    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the rodent species has unusually small litter sizes. This suggests that the species may invest more resources into each offspring, which is a characteristic of high parental investment. The other options do not directly relate to the size of the litter. Sexual size dimorphism does not necessarily correlate with litter size. Precocial young, which are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching, also does not necessarily correlate with litter size. Frequent extrapair matings, which refers to a mating system where a pair of animals will mate with others outside their pair, also does not necessarily correlate with litter size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. High parental investment\"}"
