    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polytene chromosomes are a special type of chromosome that are formed by repeated rounds of DNA replication without cell division, leading to a 'bundle' of parallel chromosomes. They are not produced only during mitosis, as mitosis involves cell division. They are actively carrying out transcription, so they are not inactive. They are not multiple copies of a single chromosome, but rather multiple copies of all the chromosomes in a cell, bundled together.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
