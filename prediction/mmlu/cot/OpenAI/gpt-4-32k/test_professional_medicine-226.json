    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include loss of sensation to pinprick over the right side of the face and tongue, which suggests damage to the sensory nerves. The nerve responsible for sensation in these areas is the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3), which passes through the foramen ovale. The other foramina listed do not transmit the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. Foramen lacerum transmits the internal carotid artery, foramen rotundum transmits the maxillary nerve (V2), and foramen spinosum transmits the middle meningeal artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
