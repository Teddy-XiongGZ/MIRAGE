    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The McDonaldization of Society is a term used by sociologist George Ritzer in his book 'The McDonaldization of Society' (1993). It refers to the process by which the principles of the fast-food restaurant are coming to dominate more and more sectors of society. This includes rationalization of decisions into cost/benefit analysis structures and away from traditional modes of thinking (A), bureaucratic organization that formalizes well-establish division of labor and impersonal structures (B), and an intense effort on achieving sameness across diverse markets (D). However, McDonaldization does not involve a dissolution of hierarchical modes of authority into collaborative team-based decision protocols (C). In fact, it often involves a strengthening of hierarchical authority and a reduction in individual autonomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
