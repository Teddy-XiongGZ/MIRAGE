    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Programmed cell death is a process where cells are genetically programmed to die after a certain point. This is a normal part of development and growth in both animals and plants. Phloem sieve tube members are living cells that transport sugars and other nutrients throughout the plant, so they do not undergo programmed cell death. Stomatal guard cells are also living cells that control the opening and closing of stomata to regulate gas exchange, so they do not undergo programmed cell death either. Root cap cells protect the growing tip of the root and are constantly being sloughed off and replaced, but this is not the same as programmed cell death. Xylem vessel members, on the other hand, are part of the plant's water transport system. These cells undergo programmed cell death, leaving behind their cell walls to form a continuous, hollow tube for water transport. Therefore, xylem vessel members are the plant cells that undergo programmed cell death to become functional.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Xylem vessel member\"}"
