    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, along with a family history of asthma, suggest a diagnosis of asthma. Chronic bronchitis is unlikely in a young, non-smoking patient. Gastroesophageal reflux disease typically presents with heartburn and regurgitation, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. Postnasal drip syndrome could cause cough and nasal congestion, but it would not be exercise-induced. The spirometry results are normal, which is consistent with exercise-induced asthma, as symptoms and airflow limitation may only be present during or after exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
