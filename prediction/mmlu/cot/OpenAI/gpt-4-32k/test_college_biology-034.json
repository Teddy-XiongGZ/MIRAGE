    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The complementary base pairs in DNA are Adenine (A) with Thymine (T), and Cytosine (C) with Guanine (G). So, the complementary sequence to 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 would be 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032. The sequence should be read from 5' to 3', so the order of the bases is important.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032\"}"
