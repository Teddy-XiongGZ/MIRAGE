    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to overactivity of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). It is more common in women than in men. It does not typically cause a large multi-nodular goitre, but rather a diffusely enlarged thyroid. Ophthalmoplegia, or paralysis of the eye muscles, is not a common symptom of Graves' disease, although eye problems can occur in Graves' disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy). 'Derbyshire Neck' was a term used to describe goitre caused by iodine deficiency, not Graves' disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
