    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-linked recessive conditions are more common in males because they only have one X chromosome, so if a disease-causing allele is present on it, they will express the disease. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they would need two copies of the disease-causing allele to express the disease. Therefore, the frequency of affected females would be the square of the frequency in males, because each X chromosome in a female has a 0.10 chance of carrying the disease-causing allele, and both need to carry it for the female to be affected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 0.01\"}"
