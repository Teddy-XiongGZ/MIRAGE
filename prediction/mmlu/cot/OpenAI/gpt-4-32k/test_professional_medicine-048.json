    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, which means the fetus could potentially be Rh-positive. If fetal Rh-positive blood cells enter the maternal circulation, the mother may form antibodies against the Rh antigen, a process known as Rh sensitization. This can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn in subsequent pregnancies. Rho(D) immune globulin is given to Rh-negative mothers to prevent this sensitization by binding to any fetal Rh-positive cells before the mother's immune system can respond to them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Formation of antibodies to RhD\"}"
