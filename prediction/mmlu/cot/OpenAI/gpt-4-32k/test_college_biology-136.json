    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where a female fruit fly with linked genes (genes that are close together on the same chromosome) for gray body and normal wings mates with a male fruit fly with black body and vestigial wings. The presence of offspring with a combination of traits from both parents (gray body from the mother and vestigial wings from the father) suggests that some form of genetic recombination has occurred. This is not due to independent assortment or segregation of alleles, as these processes apply to genes that are on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome. Penetrance refers to the proportion of individuals with a particular genotype that actually displays the phenotype associated with that genotype, which is not relevant in this case. The best explanation for the observed results is crossing over, a process that can occur during meiosis in which homologous chromosomes exchange segments, leading to new combinations of alleles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
