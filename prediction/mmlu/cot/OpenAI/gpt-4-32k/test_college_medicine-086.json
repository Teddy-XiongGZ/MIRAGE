    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrogen ions are formed during the process of glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP. This process also produces pyruvate, which can be converted to lactate in the presence of hydrogen ions. Therefore, the formation of hydrogen ions is not directly related to the depletion of glycogen or the breakdown of phosphocreatine. It is also not directly related to the use of glycolysis as a major means of resynthesising ATP, although it is a part of the process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. pyruvate is converted to lactate.\"}"
