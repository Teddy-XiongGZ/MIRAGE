    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pKb is a measure of the strength of a base. The higher the pKb, the weaker the base. The pOH is a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution. For a very weak base, the concentration of hydroxide ions would be low, meaning the pOH would be high. Therefore, the pKb of a very weak base would likely be higher than the pOH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Higher than the pOH\"}"
