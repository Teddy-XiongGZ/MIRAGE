    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The statistical power of a study is defined as the probability that it will correctly reject a false null hypothesis. In other words, it's the probability of not making a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). The probability of making a Type II error is often denoted as \u03b2. The power of a study is calculated as 1 - \u03b2. In this study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same (a Type II error) as 10%. Therefore, the power of the study is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 or 90%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 90%\"}"
