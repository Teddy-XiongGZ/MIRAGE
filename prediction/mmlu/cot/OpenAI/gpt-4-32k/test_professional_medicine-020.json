    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of low-grade fever, abdominal cramps, and tenderness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen suggest a possible infection or inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. The fact that she has been on antibiotics without relief of symptoms suggests that the cause of her symptoms is not a simple bacterial infection. The absence of bloody stools and negative test for occult blood make it less likely that she has a gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's history of intermittent constipation and the location of her pain suggest a possible issue with the colon, such as diverticulitis. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is the best next step in diagnosis as it can help visualize the colon and other abdominal structures to identify any abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
