    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coding sequences of genes are the parts that are transcribed into mRNA and then translated into proteins. These sequences are not called extrons, as extrons are the parts of the gene that are expressed. They are also not called introns, as introns are the non-coding sequences within a gene that are removed during RNA splicing. Codons are the three-nucleotide sequences in mRNA that code for specific amino acids during protein synthesis. Therefore, the coding sequences of genes are called exons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. exons.\"}"
