    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cosmopolitan species is one that can be found all over the world. To achieve this, the species would need to be able to disperse over long distances. Extreme habitat specialization would limit a species to specific environments, making it less likely to be cosmopolitan. A K-selected reproductive rate refers to species that produce fewer offspring but invest more in their survival, which doesn't necessarily correlate with a cosmopolitan distribution. Limited dispersal abilities would also prevent a species from becoming cosmopolitan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
