    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alzheimer's disease can be divided into two types: early-onset and late-onset. Early-onset Alzheimer's is often associated with mutations in genes like APP, PS1, and PS2. However, the question is asking about polygenic Alzheimer's disease, which is a form of late-onset Alzheimer's. The APOE gene, specifically the APOE4 variant, is known to increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. APOE\"}"
