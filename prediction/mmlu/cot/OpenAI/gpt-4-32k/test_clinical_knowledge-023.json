    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Informal carers are individuals who provide unpaid care to a family member, friend, or neighbor. The statement that 50% of over 65s are providing informal care seems too high. It's more likely that a smaller proportion of this age group is providing care, so option B seems more plausible. Informal carers should definitely be included in discharge planning as they are often the ones who will be providing care at home, so option C is incorrect. The statement that the majority of informal carers are fit and active is too broad and doesn't take into account the physical and emotional strain that caregiving can put on a person, so option D is also incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
