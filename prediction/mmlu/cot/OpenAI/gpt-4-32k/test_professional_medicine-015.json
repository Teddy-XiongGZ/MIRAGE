    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a motor vehicle collision. The most appropriate approach to confirm the diagnosis would be to conduct a thorough interview, asking the patient to provide a detailed narrative of the incident and his symptoms. This would allow the clinician to assess the patient's symptoms in the context of the traumatic event, and to evaluate whether they meet the criteria for PTSD.
