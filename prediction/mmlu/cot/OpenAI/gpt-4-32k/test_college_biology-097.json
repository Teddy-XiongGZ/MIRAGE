    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antibiotics are designed to target bacterial cells and disrupt their functions, leading to their death or inhibition. A. Peptidoglycan synthesis is a process unique to bacteria, and many antibiotics, like penicillin, target this process. B. Protein synthesis is also a target for antibiotics, as they can bind to bacterial ribosomes and disrupt this process. C. DNA synthesis is another target, as antibiotics can inhibit enzymes necessary for this process. D. Reverse transcriptase, however, is not a process typically found in bacteria. It is an enzyme used by retroviruses, like HIV, to replicate their genetic material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
