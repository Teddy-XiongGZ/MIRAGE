    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. During this process, ATP is produced via substrate-level phosphorylation. For each glucose molecule, 4 ATP molecules are produced, but 2 ATP are consumed in the early steps of glycolysis, resulting in a net production of 2 ATP. When glycogen is the starting molecule, one less ATP is consumed in the early steps, resulting in a net production of 3 ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen.\"}"
