    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An action potential arriving at the motor endplate triggers the release of neurotransmitters. The primary neurotransmitter involved in this process is acetylcholine, which traverses the neuromuscular junction and binds to receptors on the muscle membrane, causing depolarization and muscle contraction. Sodium ions, calcium ions, and noradrenaline are also involved in the process, but they are not directly released as a result of the action potential arriving at the motor endplate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
