    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thigmotropism is a directional growth movement which occurs as a mechanosensory response to a touch stimulus. Phototropism is the growth of organisms in response to a light stimulus. Gravitropism is a turning or growth movement by a plant or fungus in response to gravity. Negative gravitropism is the growth of plant parts against the force of gravity. A plant growing along a trellis is responding to the physical touch of the trellis, which is a characteristic of thigmotropism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
