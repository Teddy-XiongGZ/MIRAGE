    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Serial peak flow readings are used to measure the maximum speed of expiration, which can help diagnose conditions that affect the airways. Asthma is a condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to variable and reversible airflow obstruction. This variability can be captured by serial peak flow readings. COPD, on the other hand, is characterized by persistent, not variable, airflow limitation. Pneumonia and tuberculosis primarily affect the lung parenchyma, not the airways, and would not be diagnosed using peak flow readings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. . . . asthma.\"}"
