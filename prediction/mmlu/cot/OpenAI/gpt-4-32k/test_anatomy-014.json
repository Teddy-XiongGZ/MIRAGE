    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandible is a complex bone that undergoes significant growth and development. Let's analyze each option. A. The mental symphysis, which is the fusion of the two halves of the mandible, actually closes before birth, not 1 year postnatally. B. The condylar growth cartilage, which contributes to the vertical and posterior growth of the mandible, does not cease activity at puberty. In fact, it continues to grow until the late teens or early twenties. C. The ossification center of the mandibular bone appears around the 6th week of intrauterine life, not the 8th week. Moreover, it is not medial to Meckel's cartilage, but rather it forms lateral to it. D. The functional matrix theory suggests that the growth of the mandible is influenced by the surrounding soft tissues, including muscles. The lateral pterygoid muscle is indeed one of the muscles that influence the growth of the mandible, particularly at the angle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
