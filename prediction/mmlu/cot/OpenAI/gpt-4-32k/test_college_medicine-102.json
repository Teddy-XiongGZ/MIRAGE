    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is an anaerobic process, meaning it does not require oxygen. The conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA, also known as beta-oxidation, does not directly use oxygen. Glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, also does not require oxygen. However, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, also known as the Krebs' cycle or citric acid cycle, is an aerobic process, meaning it does require oxygen. This is because the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, which is part of the Krebs' cycle, is oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
