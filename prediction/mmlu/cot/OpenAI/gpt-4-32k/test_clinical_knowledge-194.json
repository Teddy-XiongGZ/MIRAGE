    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phosphocreatine is a molecule that serves as a rapidly mobilizable reserve of high-energy phosphates in skeletal muscle and the brain to recycle adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of the cell. After high-intensity exercise, it takes some time for phosphocreatine to be resynthesized. The process is not immediate and takes longer than a few seconds or a minute. Research shows that it takes about 3 to 5 minutes for phosphocreatine stores to be fully replenished after intense exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. about 4 minutes.\"}"
