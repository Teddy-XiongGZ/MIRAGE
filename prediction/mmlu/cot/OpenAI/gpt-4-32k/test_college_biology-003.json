    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A second messenger is a molecule that relays signals received at receptors on the cell surface to target molecules inside the cell. Prostaglandins are a group of lipids that act like hormones and are not second messengers. Cyclic AMP is a second messenger, but it primarily activates protein kinases, not the release of calcium ions. Calmodulin is a calcium-binding messenger protein, not a second messenger. Inositol triphosphate (IP3) is a second messenger that binds to IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Inositol triphosphate\"}"
