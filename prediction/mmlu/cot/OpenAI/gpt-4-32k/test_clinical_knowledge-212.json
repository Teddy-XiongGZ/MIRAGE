The disease is characterized by excessive breakdown and formation of bone tissue that can cause the affected bones to weaken, resulting in pain, misshapen bones, fractures, and arthritis in the joints near the affected bones. Therefore, pathological fractures are indeed a feature of Paget's disease, ruling out option D. Heart failure is a recognized complication of Paget's disease due to increased cardiac output, ruling out option C. Spinal cord compression is not a common complication of Paget's disease, ruling out option B. This leaves us with option A, which is indeed a characteristic feature of Paget's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
