    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactate and hydrogen ions are byproducts of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle. They need to leave the muscle to be metabolized or excreted. They do not leave via a cotransport mechanism with carnosine, as carnosine is a dipeptide of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine, and it does not have a role in the transport of lactate or hydrogen ions. They also do not leave via an active transport mechanism, as this would require energy, and the process of lactate and hydrogen ion removal from the muscle does not require energy. They do not leave via a protein transporter molecule, as this would imply a specific protein is required for their transport. Instead, they leave the muscle by simple diffusion, which is a passive process where molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
