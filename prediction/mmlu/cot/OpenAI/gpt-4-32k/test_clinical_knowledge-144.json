    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy charge of the cell is not the difference between the charge on the outside and inside of a cell, that's the membrane potential. It's also not generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase, that's related to maintaining the cell's resting potential. The overall rate of energy use by the cell is more related to metabolism, not the energy charge. The energy charge of a cell is a measure of the energy status of the cell, and it's determined by the extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool (ATP, ADP, AMP) is phosphorylated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
