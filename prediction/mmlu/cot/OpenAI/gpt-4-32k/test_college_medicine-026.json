    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the Doppler effect, which is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In this case, the source of the sound (the gunshot) is moving away from the observer (the camera), and the observer is also moving away from the source. We can use the formula for the Doppler effect in this case, which is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v + vs), where f' is the observed frequency, f is the source frequency, v is the speed of sound, vo is the speed of the observer, and vs is the speed of the source. The speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s. The speeds of the car and the platform need to be converted from km/h to m/s, which gives approximately 30 m/s for the car and 20 m/s for the platform. Substituting these values into the formula gives f' = 800 * (343 + 20) / (343 + 30), which calculates to approximately 924 Hz.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
