    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of producing different proteins from the same gene is not achieved by selective transcription of different parts of the DNA in the gene, as transcription is a process that involves the entire gene. Doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule produced from the primary transcript does not result in different proteins, but rather a longer protein. Splicing of the mRNA molecule after it has been formed from the primary transcript is a part of the process, but it is not the main mechanism. The main mechanism is alternative RNA splicing, where the primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, which then code for different proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
