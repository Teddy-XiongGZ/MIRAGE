    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about hybrid sterility, which is a common phenomenon in plants where the offspring of two different species are unable to reproduce due to differences in chromosome numbers. However, the question also mentions that the chromosome number of the hybrid plant can sometimes double spontaneously. This doubling of chromosomes, known as polyploidy, can allow the chromosomes to pair up normally during meiosis, which is a crucial step in sexual reproduction. Therefore, the descendants of these plants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
