    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The boy's symptoms of hives, hoarseness, and light-headedness that occurred shortly after a bee sting are indicative of an allergic reaction. The fact that each subsequent reaction has been more severe is concerning for anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. While avoidance strategies such as not going to areas known to have bees or not wearing colorful clothing outside can help reduce the risk of bee stings, they are not foolproof and do not provide immediate treatment in the event of a sting. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can help with allergic reactions, but it is not the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The most appropriate recommendation for this patient would be to carry self-injectable epinephrine, which can quickly reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis and potentially save his life.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Carrying self-injectable epinephrine\"}"
