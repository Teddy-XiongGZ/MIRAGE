    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FGFR3 is a gene that provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Mutations in this gene are known to cause several conditions. Achondroplasia, Crouzon syndrome, and Thanatophoric dysplasia are all conditions caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. However, Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic condition that can cause hearing loss and changes in coloring (pigmentation) of the hair, skin, and eyes. It is not caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, but rather mutations in other genes such as PAX3, MITF, EDN3, EDNRB, SOX10, and SNAI2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Waardenburg syndrome\"}"
