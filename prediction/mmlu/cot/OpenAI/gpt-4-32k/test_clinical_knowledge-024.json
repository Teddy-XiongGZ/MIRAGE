    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protein modification after translation is a common process in cells. Lipidation, glycosylation, and phosphorylation are all known post-translational modifications. They involve the addition of lipid groups, sugar moieties, and phosphate groups to the protein, respectively. However, the attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not a post-translational modification. This process is part of the translation itself, where amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form the protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
