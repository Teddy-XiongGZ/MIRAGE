    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is transported into cells via glucose transporters. There are several types of these, but the one that is primarily responsible for glucose uptake in muscle cells is GLUT4. This process is indeed facilitated by insulin, but it's not accurate to say that it only occurs in the presence of insulin. Hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates glucose once it's inside the cell, not a transporter. Monocarboxylic acid transporters are involved in the transport of monocarboxylic acids, not glucose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
