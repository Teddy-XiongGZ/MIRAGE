    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The elbow joint is a complex structure that allows for both flexion and extension, as well as a small amount of rotation. It is not a ball and socket joint, which allows for a wide range of movement in all directions, like the shoulder or hip. It is also not a fused joint, as these are immovable, like the sutures in the skull. A plain joint, also known as a gliding joint, allows bones to slide past one another, which is not the case with the elbow. The elbow is a synovial hinge joint, which allows movement in one plane, much like a door hinge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Synovial hinge joint.\"}"
