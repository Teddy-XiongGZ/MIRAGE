    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The body has several ways to produce energy for muscle contractions. For very short, high-intensity contractions, the body primarily uses ATP stores and phosphocreatine stores. ATP is the immediate source of energy for muscle contractions, but these stores are depleted within a few seconds. Phosphocreatine can quickly donate a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP, providing energy for another 5-7 seconds of contraction. Glycolysis and creatine phosphorylation are slower processes that provide energy for longer duration activities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. phosphocreatine stores.\"}"
