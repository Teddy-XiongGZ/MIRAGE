    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Connective tissue is a type of tissue that provides support and structure to other tissues and organs in the body. It contains cells, fibers, and extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts are a type of cell found in connective tissue that produces collagen and other fibers. Collagens are the main structural protein in the extracellular space in various connective tissues. Glycosaminoglycans are a type of complex carbohydrate that helps maintain and support collagen, elastin, turgidity (bounce) in the cellular spaces and keep protein fibers in balance and proportion. Thrombin, on the other hand, is an enzyme in blood plasma that causes the clotting of blood. It is not a component of connective tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
