    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During high intensity exercise, the body needs more energy, which is provided by glucose. The body responds to this increased demand by releasing more glucose into the bloodstream. However, the body also increases the rate at which it uses glucose, so the overall concentration of glucose in the blood may not change significantly. Therefore, it is unlikely that the blood glucose concentration frequently rises or falls by 1 - 3 mM. It is also unlikely that the blood glucose concentration falls to hypoglycaemic levels, as the body has mechanisms to prevent this from happening.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
