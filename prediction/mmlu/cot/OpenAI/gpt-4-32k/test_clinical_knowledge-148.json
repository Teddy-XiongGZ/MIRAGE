    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A large goitre can cause compression symptoms due to its size. However, stridor is caused by compression of the trachea, not the oesophagus, so option A is incorrect. Hoarseness can be caused by compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, not the trachea, so option C is also incorrect. The size of the goitre does not necessarily correlate with the severity of thyrotoxicosis, so option D is incorrect. Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, can occur if the goitre is large enough to compress the oesophagus, and this is indeed an indication for surgery, making option B correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
