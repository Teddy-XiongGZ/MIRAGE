    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RNA and DNA are both nucleic acids, but they have different nucleotide bases. RNA contains the bases adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). DNA contains the bases adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Therefore, the base that is not found in RNA is thymine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
