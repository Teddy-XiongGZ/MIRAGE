    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine. The first line of treatment usually involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but in this case, the patient has not responded to them. Sulfasalazine is another option, but it also has not been effective. The next step in treatment would be to use a biologic drug.

TNF is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is found to be overexpressed in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1\"}"
