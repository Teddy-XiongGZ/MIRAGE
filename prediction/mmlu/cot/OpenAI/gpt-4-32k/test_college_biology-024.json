    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prions are infectious proteins, not DNA. Cistrons are a term for a gene, which is a fixed part of the genome. Introns are non-coding regions of DNA within a gene, they do not move around. Transposons, also known as 'jumping genes', are segments of DNA that can move around to different positions in the genome of a single cell, a process called transposition. In the process, they can cause mutations and change the cell's genetic identity and genome size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. transposons\"}"
