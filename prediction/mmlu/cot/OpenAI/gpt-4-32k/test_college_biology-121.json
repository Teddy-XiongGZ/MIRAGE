    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Circadian rhythm is an internal process that regulates the sleep-wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours. It's not an environmental signal. Changing air temperature is not reliable because it can fluctuate due to various factors, not just seasonal changes. Fluctuations in abscisic acid levels are more related to stress responses in plants, not flowering. Photoperiod, which is the length of day and night, changes predictably throughout the year and is a strong environmental cue for many biological processes, including the initiation of flowering in many plant species.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
