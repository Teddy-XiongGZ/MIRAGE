    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transpiration is the process by which moisture is carried through plants from roots to small pores on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere. High temperature increases the rate of transpiration because it increases the rate of evaporation of water from the plant leaves. Wind also increases the rate of transpiration because it removes the layer of humid air around the leaf, allowing more water to evaporate. Low relative humidity increases the rate of transpiration because the drier the air, the more water vapor it can hold, and thus the more water can evaporate from the plant. However, high relative humidity decreases the rate of transpiration because the air is already saturated with water vapor and thus less water can evaporate from the plant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
