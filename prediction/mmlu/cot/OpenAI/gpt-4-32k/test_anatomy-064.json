    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The accessory nerve, also known as the 11th cranial nerve, innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is involved in turning the head, while the trapezius muscle is involved in shrugging the shoulders. Therefore, to test the function of the accessory nerve, we would need to test the function of these muscles. Extending the neck would not directly test these muscles, so options A and B can be eliminated. Between options C and D, testing against resistance would provide a more accurate assessment of muscle and nerve function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
