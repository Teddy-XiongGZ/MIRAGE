    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Beta-blockers are often used to treat angina. They work by blocking the effects of the hormone epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. As a result, the heart beats more slowly and with less force, reducing blood pressure and strain on the heart. Therefore, the mechanism by which beta-blockers improve symptoms in this case is by decreasing myocardial contractility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Decreasing myocardial contractility\"}"
