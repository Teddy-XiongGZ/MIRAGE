    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Respiration is a process that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, so it is a source of atmospheric carbon. Bacterial decomposition also releases carbon dioxide, so it is also a source. Combustion of fossil fuels is a major source of atmospheric carbon as it releases large amounts of carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis, on the other hand, is a process that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converts it into oxygen and glucose, so it is not a source of atmospheric carbon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Photosynthesis\"}"
