    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Blood units are stored under refrigeration to maintain their quality and safety. If a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit, it may not be safe for transfusion. Transfusing it as soon as possible (option A) or refrigerating it for a minimum of 12 hours and then administering it (option D) could put the patient at risk. Disposing of the contents in the sluice area and keeping the bag for record purposes (option B) would not inform the blood bank of the issue. The best course of action would be to return it to the blood bank and inform them of why you have done so (option C). This way, the blood bank can properly dispose of the blood unit and take steps to prevent similar issues in the future.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
