    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a palpable thyroid nodule, which is a common finding. The majority of these nodules are benign, but malignancy must be ruled out. The first step in evaluation of a thyroid nodule is measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to rule out hyperthyroidism, which has been done and is normal in this case. The next step for nodules >1 cm is fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to evaluate for malignancy. CT scan of the neck is not typically used in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Radionuclide thyroid scan is used when TSH is low to determine if the nodule is functioning (hot) or nonfunctioning (cold). Thyroidectomy is not the first-line treatment for a thyroid nodule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule\"}"
