    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The urea cycle and the citric acid cycle are both cyclical metabolic pathways. In the urea cycle, ornithine is regenerated in each turn of the cycle. Similarly, in the citric acid cycle, oxaloacetate is regenerated in each turn of the cycle. The other options, succinate, fumarate, and citrate, are not regenerated in each turn of the citric acid cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Oxaloacetate\"}"
