    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The human genome is the complete set of nucleic acid sequences for humans, encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosome pairs in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within individual mitochondria. While it might seem that a large portion of our DNA would be dedicated to coding for the proteins that make up our bodies, in reality, only a small fraction of the human genome actually encodes proteins. The rest of the genome is made up of non-coding regions, which include regulatory sequences, introns, and non-coding RNAs. According to scientific research, only about 2% of the human genome encodes proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
