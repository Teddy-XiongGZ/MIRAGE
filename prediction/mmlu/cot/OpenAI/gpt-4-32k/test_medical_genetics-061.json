    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Duodenal atresia, holoprosencephaly, and hydrops fetalis are all conditions that can be associated with chromosomal abnormalities. Duodenal atresia is often associated with Down syndrome, holoprosencephaly can be associated with trisomy 13, and hydrops fetalis can be associated with a variety of chromosomal abnormalities. Monozygotic twins, on the other hand, are not typically associated with chromosomal abnormalities. They result from a single fertilized egg splitting into two, leading to two embryos with identical genetic material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Monozygotic twins\"}"
