    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are metabolized primarily in skeletal muscle, rather than the liver. When BCAAs are deaminated, the resulting ammonia is not converted into arginine or urea in the muscle, nor is it used to synthesize purines and pyrimidines. Instead, the ammonia is incorporated into the amino acids alanine and glutamine, which are then released from the muscle and transported to the liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
