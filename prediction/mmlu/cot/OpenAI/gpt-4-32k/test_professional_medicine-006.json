    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is already on medication for her major depressive disorder, but her symptoms suggest that her depression is not well controlled. She is crying all the time and refusing to get out of bed, despite her pain being relatively low. This indicates that her emotional distress is not primarily due to physical pain. Therefore, increasing her oxycodone dosage would not be the most appropriate next step. Reassurance alone is unlikely to be sufficient given the severity of her symptoms. Dextroamphetamine is not typically used as a first-line treatment for depression. The most immediate concern in a patient with severe depression is the risk of suicide, so it would be most appropriate to assess for suicidal ideation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
