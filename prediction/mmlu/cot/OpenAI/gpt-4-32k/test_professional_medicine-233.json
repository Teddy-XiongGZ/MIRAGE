    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and disorientation, along with his elevated temperature, rapid pulse, and rapid respirations, suggest that he is suffering from heat stroke. This is further supported by the fact that his symptoms began during a full-contact football practice in full uniform, which would have increased his body temperature. A CT scan of the head is not necessary as his symptoms are not suggestive of a head injury. Sodium chloride tablets would not be appropriate as they would not address his dehydration and could potentially worsen his condition. Immersing the patient in an ice water bath could lead to vasoconstriction and shivering, which would increase his body temperature. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer intravenous fluids to rehydrate the patient and help lower his body temperature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Administer intravenous fluids\"}"
