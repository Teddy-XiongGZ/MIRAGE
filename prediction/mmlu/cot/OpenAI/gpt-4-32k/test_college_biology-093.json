    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fungi are indeed eukaryotic organisms, which means they have a true nucleus, so option A is true. They also have rigid cell walls, typically composed of chitin, so option B is true. Most fungi are filamentous, forming structures called hyphae, so option C is true.
