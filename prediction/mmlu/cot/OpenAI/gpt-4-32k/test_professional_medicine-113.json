    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's skin lesion is described as a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. This is indicative of a stage 1 pressure ulcer, which is characterized by non-blanchable erythema of intact skin. The most effective intervention for a stage 1 pressure ulcer is to relieve the pressure causing the ulcer. This can be achieved by frequent turning of the patient to redistribute pressure.
