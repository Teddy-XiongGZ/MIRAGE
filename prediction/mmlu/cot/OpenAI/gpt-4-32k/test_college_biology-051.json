    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intracellular messengers are molecules that mediate intracellular communication. They are often second messengers, meaning they relay the signal from the receptor to the inside of the cell. Calcium ions (A) are well known second messengers in many signal transduction pathways. cAMP (B) is a common second messenger that is involved in many different cellular processes. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (D) is a second messenger that transduces many cellular signals. Acetylcholine (C), on the other hand, is a neurotransmitter that transmits signals across a chemical synapse, not inside the cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
