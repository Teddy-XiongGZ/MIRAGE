    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chunking is a process of breaking down complex information into smaller, manageable parts, which doesn't seem to be the case here. A network model is a representation of knowledge as a network of interconnected ideas, which is not exactly what the student is doing. Maintenance rehearsal is the process of repeatedly thinking about or saying information to keep it in short-term memory, which also doesn't fit the scenario. Elaborative rehearsal, on the other hand, involves relating new information to information already stored in memory, which is exactly what the student is doing. He is relating new information about electrochemical cells to previously learned information about redox reactions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Elaborative rehearsal\"}"
