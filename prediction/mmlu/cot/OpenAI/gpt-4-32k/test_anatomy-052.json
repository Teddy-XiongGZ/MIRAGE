    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Systemic circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system which carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The blood is pumped from the left ventricle into the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. From the aorta, the blood travels through smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches the capillaries. After the exchange of oxygen and nutrients for carbon dioxide and waste products in the capillaries, the blood travels through venules into veins and then back to the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
