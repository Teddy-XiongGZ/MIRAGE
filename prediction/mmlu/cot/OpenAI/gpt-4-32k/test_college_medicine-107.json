    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. The rate limiting step of a metabolic pathway is the slowest step, and thus determines the overall rate of the entire process. In glycolysis, the rate limiting step is the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. phosphofructokinase.\"}"
