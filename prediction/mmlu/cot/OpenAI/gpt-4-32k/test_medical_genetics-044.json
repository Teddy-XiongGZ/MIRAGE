    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The polymerase chain reaction, also known as PCR, is a technique used in molecular biology. It is not used to demonstrate DNA as the genetic material, that was done through other experiments. It also does not determine the content of minerals in a soil sample, as that is more related to geology and environmental science. PCR does not measure the ribosome transfer rate during translation, as that is a process related to protein synthesis. PCR is a technique that uses short DNA primers and a thermostable DNA polymerase to replicate specific DNA sequences in vitro, which means it is used to amplify a specific DNA sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
