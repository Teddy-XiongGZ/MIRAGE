    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The thoracic cage, also known as the rib cage, is a bony and cartilaginous structure which surrounds the thoracic cavity and supports the pectoral girdle, forming a core portion of the human skeleton. It protects vital organs within the thoracic (and upper abdominal) cavity and provides the necessary rigidity for the lungs to function, i.e., for respiration. Alimentation refers to nutrition, which is not directly related to the thoracic cage. Menstruation is a female reproductive process, and mentation refers to mental activity, both of which are not related to the thoracic cage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Respiration\"}"
