    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a principle stating that the genetic variation in a population will remain constant from one generation to the next in the absence of disturbing factors. These factors include a large population, random mating, and absence of selection. However, genetic drift, which is a change in the frequency of a gene variant in a population due to random sampling, is not assumed in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In fact, it is one of the factors that can disrupt this equilibrium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
