    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inbreeding coefficient, F, is a measure of the likelihood of two alleles at a given locus in an individual being identical by descent. In other words, it measures the probability that two alleles are the same because they have been inherited from a common ancestor. Therefore, an increase in the inbreeding coefficient would mean that there is a higher chance of identical alleles being present in an individual. This would reduce the likelihood of heterozygotes, which are individuals with two different alleles at a locus, being present in a population. The other options do not directly relate to the concept of inbreeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
