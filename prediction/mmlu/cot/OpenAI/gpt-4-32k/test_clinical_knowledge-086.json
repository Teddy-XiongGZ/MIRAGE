    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Wound drainage is an important aspect of post-operative care. It needs to be assessed regularly to monitor the healing process and to detect any signs of infection or complications early. The frequency of this assessment should be high enough to catch any changes in a timely manner, but not so high as to be impractical or disruptive to the patient's care. Assessing the wound drainage each time post-operative observations are undertaken would be a good balance, as these observations are typically done several times a day. This would be more frequent than daily, but less frequent than every hour, and would not be limited to when the wound dressing is changed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
