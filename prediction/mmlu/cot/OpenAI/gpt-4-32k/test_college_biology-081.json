    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Western blot hybridization is used to detect specific proteins in a sample. Northern blot hybridization is used to study the expression of a specific RNA molecule. Southern blot hybridization is used to detect a specific DNA sequence in DNA samples. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) is a common affinity electrophoresis technique used to study protein-DNA or protein-RNA interactions. This technique involves the binding of a protein to a DNA or RNA probe and then running the sample on a non-denaturing gel. The bound protein causes the DNA or RNA to migrate more slowly, demonstrating that the protein is binding to the DNA or RNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
