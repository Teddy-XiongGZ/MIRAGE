    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exon skipping is a process that occurs during RNA processing, where certain exons are left out of the final mRNA transcript. This is not associated with nonsense mutations, which introduce a premature stop codon into the sequence, or silent mutations, which do not change the amino acid sequence. Regulatory mutations could potentially influence exon skipping, but they are not directly associated with the process. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that exon skipping is associated with RNA processing mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. RNA processing mutations.\"}"
