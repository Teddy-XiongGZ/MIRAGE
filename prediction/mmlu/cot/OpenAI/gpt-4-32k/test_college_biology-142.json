    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An early-successional plant community is one that is in the early stages of ecological succession, which is the process by which a biological community evolves over time. These communities are typically characterized by rapid growth and high rates of primary production, as they are often colonizing disturbed or newly available habitats. They are not typically characterized by high niche divergence among co-occurring species, as this tends to occur in more mature communities where competition has led to niche specialization. They also do not typically have a high frequency of K-selected species, which are species that thrive in stable, predictable environments, not the disturbed or newly available habitats that early-successional communities colonize. Lastly, they do not typically have high detrital biomass, as this also tends to accumulate in more mature communities. Therefore, the characteristic that is predicted for an early-successional plant community is high ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
