    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where mouse and human cell-surface proteins were observed to integrate along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane. This suggests that the two types of cells were combined in some way. The process of creating a heterokaryon involves fusing two different cells together, which would allow for the observation of the integration of the cell-surface proteins. The other options do not involve the fusion of two different types of cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Producing a heterokaryon\"}"
