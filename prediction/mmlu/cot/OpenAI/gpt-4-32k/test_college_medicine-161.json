    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The quantum number l = 2 corresponds to the d orbital. Gold (Au) is in the 6th period of the periodic table, and its electron configuration ends in 5d10 6s1. This means that there are 10 electrons in the 5d orbital. However, there are also 4d and 3d orbitals in the electron configuration of gold, each of which also contains 10 electrons. Therefore, the total number of electrons in gold that have a quantum number l = 2 is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30. However, this option is not available, so there might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
