    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbA). This means that it binds to oxygen more tightly. If an individual retains HbF into adulthood, they would have an increased ability to bind oxygen. However, this does not necessarily mean that they would have increased oxygen binding in the tissues, as the question suggests. Instead, it would mean that their hemoglobin would be less likely to release oxygen to the tissues, because it is holding onto it more tightly. Therefore, the person would not exhibit no differences from a normal adult, significantly reduced oxygen binding in the lungs, or no symptoms, since retention of fetal hemoglobin would not be fatal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. increased oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the tissues.\"}"
