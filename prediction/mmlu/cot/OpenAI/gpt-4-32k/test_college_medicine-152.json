    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle contraction is a complex process that requires energy. This energy is provided by ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the primary energy currency of the cell. ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a product of ATP dephosphorylation and is not the direct energy source. Phosphocreatine is a rapidly mobilizable reserve of high-energy phosphates in skeletal muscle and is used to generate ATP from ADP, but it is not the direct energy source for muscle contraction. Oxidative phosphorylation is a metabolic pathway that uses energy released by the oxidation of nutrients to produce ATP, but again, it is not the direct energy source for muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. ATP.\"}"
