    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a principle stating that the genetic variation in a population will remain constant from one generation to the next in the absence of disturbing factors. The frequency of heterozygotes is calculated by the formula 2pq, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles. In this case, p=0.6 and q=0.4. So, the frequency of heterozygotes will be 2*0.6*0.4=0.48.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
