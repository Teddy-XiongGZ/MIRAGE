    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Urticaria, also known as hives, is a common condition that often has no identifiable cause, especially in the case of acute urticaria, which seems to be the case with this patient. The first step in managing urticaria is usually symptomatic treatment, not extensive testing or referral to a specialist. Serum IgE concentration and total eosinophil count could be useful in identifying an allergic cause, but these tests are not typically done unless the patient has recurrent or chronic urticaria, or if there is a suspicion of a specific allergen. Referring her to an allergist could be considered if the urticaria becomes chronic or if a specific allergen is suspected, but this is not the first step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
