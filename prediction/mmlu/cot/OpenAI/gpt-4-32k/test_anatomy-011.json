    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve, controls most of the eye's movements and pupil constriction. Damage to this nerve can result in a condition known as oculomotor nerve palsy. This condition can cause the eye to deviate down and out, which is a lateral strabismus, due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. Additionally, it can cause pupillary dilatation, as the parasympathetic fibers responsible for pupillary constriction are affected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus\"}"
