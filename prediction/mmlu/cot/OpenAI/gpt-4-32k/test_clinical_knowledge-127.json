    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insensible loss refers to the loss of body fluids that is not easily measured, such as through sweating, breathing, and evaporation from the skin. Pyrexia, or fever, can increase insensible loss through increased metabolic rate and sweating. Using unhumidified oxygen can also lead to insensible loss as it can dry out the respiratory tract and lead to fluid loss. Diarrhoea is a form of sensible loss, as it is a visible and measurable loss of fluid. Excessive weight loss does not directly cause insensible loss, it is usually a result of other factors such as decreased food intake or increased metabolic activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
