    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Paracetamol is a common over-the-counter medication used to relieve pain and reduce fever. It is generally safe for most people when used correctly. However, it can interfere with the effectiveness of other drugs such as Warfarin, so option A is correct. Option B is not necessarily true, as paracetamol can be used regularly for chronic pain management under a doctor's supervision. Option C is also correct, as many over-the-counter cold and flu remedies contain paracetamol, and taking these in combination with separate paracetamol tablets can lead to an overdose. Option D is incorrect, as paracetamol is often used to reduce fever (pyrexia), not contraindicated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A, C\"}"
