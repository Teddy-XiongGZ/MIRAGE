    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with a Bartholin gland abscess, which is a common cause of vulvar masses in women of reproductive age. Bartholin glands are located bilaterally at the posterior introitus and drain through ducts that empty into the vestibule at approximately the 4-o'clock and 8-o'clock positions. Obstruction of these ducts can lead to fluid accumulation and cyst formation. Secondary infection of the cyst can lead to abscess formation. The most common organisms involved are normal vaginal flora, including Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. Sexually transmitted organisms (eg, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis) can also be involved, especially in sexually active women. The treatment of a Bartholin gland abscess involves incision and drainage. Word catheter placement after incision and drainage can help prevent recurrence. Antibiotics are not routinely required unless cellulitis is present or the patient is immunocompromised.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Incision and drainage\"}"
