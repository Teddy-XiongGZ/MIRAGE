    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to balance the chemical equation. The balanced equation is: C2H4 + 3O2 \u2014> 2CO2 + 2H2O. This tells us that one molecule of ethane (C2H4) produces two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2). Next, we need to calculate the molar mass of ethane. The molar mass of ethane is (2*12) + (4*1) = 28g/mol. The molar mass of carbon dioxide is (1*12) + (2*16) = 44g/mol. Since one mole of ethane produces two moles of carbon dioxide, 28g of ethane will produce 2*44g = 88g of carbon dioxide. Therefore, 84g of ethane will produce (84/28)*88 = 264g of carbon dioxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
