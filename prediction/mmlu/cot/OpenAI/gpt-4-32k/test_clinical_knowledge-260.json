    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure to create an opening through the neck into the trachea, or windpipe. The primary purpose of a tracheostomy is to provide an airway and to remove secretions from the lungs. It is not typically used to repair vocal cords after paralysis (option A) or to aid swallowing (option B). While it might be used prior to certain types of neck surgery (option D), this is not its primary purpose. However, a tracheostomy is often used as an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator (option C), as it can provide a more stable and secure airway for long-term ventilator support.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
