    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In the case of sound, the Doppler shift can be observed as a change in pitch of the sound as the source moves closer or further away. To calculate the Doppler shift, we need to know the speed of sound in the medium, because the speed of sound can affect how quickly the waves reach the observer. We also need to know the frequency of the emitted sound, because the change in frequency is what we're trying to calculate. The time of interaction and the distance between the source and detector are not necessary to calculate the Doppler shift.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
