    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hypothesis is that stress from studying for exams is making students more susceptible to infections. Stress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that suppresses the immune system. Therefore, if the hypothesis is correct, we would expect to see an increase in cortisol levels, not a decrease. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that engulfs and digests cellular debris, foreign substances, microbes, and cancer cells in a process called phagocytosis. Decreased macrophage activity would mean a weakened immune response, which could make the students more susceptible to infections. Basophils and lymphocytes are also types of white blood cells, but they are not directly related to stress response. Therefore, changes in their counts would not necessarily support the hypothesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decreased macrophage activity\"}"
