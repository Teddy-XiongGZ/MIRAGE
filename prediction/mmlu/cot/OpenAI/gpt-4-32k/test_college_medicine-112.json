    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bernoulli\u2019s principle of fluid dynamics states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. In the human body, the heart pumps blood, creating pressure that propels the blood through the vessels. The pressure is highest at the heart and decreases as the blood moves further away. Therefore, the pressure in the capillaries of the neck, which are closer to the heart, would be greater than the pressure in the capillaries of the knee, which are further away.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
