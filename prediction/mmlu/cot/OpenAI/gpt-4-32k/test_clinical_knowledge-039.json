    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy expenditure of oxygen consumption is approximately 20 kJ per liter. Therefore, if the athlete is consuming 2 liters per minute, we can calculate the energy expenditure by multiplying the rate of oxygen consumption by the energy expenditure per liter. That is 2 l/min * 20 kJ/l = 40 kJ/min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
