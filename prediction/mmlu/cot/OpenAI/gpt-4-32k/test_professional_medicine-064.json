    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This can be due to various causes, including pulmonary embolism. The physical signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension are often subtle and non-specific. However, among the options provided, a P2 louder than A2 is the most specific sign. This is because the P2 sound is produced by the closure of the pulmonary valve, and if this sound is louder than the A2 (aortic valve closure), it suggests increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Increased jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, and presence of an S3 are more indicative of right heart failure or systemic venous congestion, not specifically pulmonary arterial hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
