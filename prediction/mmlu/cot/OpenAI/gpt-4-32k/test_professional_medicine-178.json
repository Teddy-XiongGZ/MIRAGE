    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has expressed her wish not to be intubated again. She also expressed her wish to die at home. Her advance directive, which was signed by both her and her daughter, supports her decision. The daughter's insistence on hospital admission contradicts the patient's expressed wishes and the advance directive.
