    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with body mass index (BMI). However, these SNPs explain only a small fraction of the variation in BMI. This is known as the 'missing heritability' problem, where the genetic variants identified by GWAS explain less of the heritability of a trait than would be expected from family and twin studies. The exact percentage can vary depending on the study, but it's generally agreed that known SNPs explain a relatively small percentage of the variation in BMI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. only 5%\"}"
