    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why the genes that allow host birds to be tricked by cuckoos remain in the gene pool. This means we need to find a reason that these genes would not be selected against. Option A suggests that the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently, which could be a reason these genes are not selected against. Option B suggests that the fitness of the duped bird is not compromised, which could also be a reason these genes are not selected against. Option C suggests that little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, which could be a reason these genes are not selected against. However, this seems less likely as raising a fledgling, whether it's their own or a cuckoo's, would still require energy and resources. Option D suggests that the fitness of the cuckoo would be reduced, but this doesn't explain why the host bird's genes would remain in the gene pool. Therefore, the most likely answer is A or B. Between these two, A seems more plausible as it explains why the host bird's genes would be beneficial, while B only explains why they wouldn't be detrimental.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
