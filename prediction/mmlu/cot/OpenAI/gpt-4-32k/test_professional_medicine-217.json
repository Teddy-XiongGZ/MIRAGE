    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Blood pressure is determined by the cardiac output and the peripheral vascular resistance. Cardiac output is the product of heart rate (pulse) and stroke volume. Therefore, a decrease in cardiac output or stroke volume would likely decrease blood pressure, not increase it. Similarly, a decrease in pulse would also likely lead to a decrease in blood pressure. On the other hand, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance would increase the pressure against which the heart must pump, thereby increasing blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased peripheral vascular resistance\"}"
