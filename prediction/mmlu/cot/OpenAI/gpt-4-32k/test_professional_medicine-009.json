    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of passing a renal calculus, which was found to be primarily composed of calcium. His 24-hour urine collection also shows increased calcium excretion. This suggests that he has hypercalciuria, a condition that can lead to the formation of calcium stones in the kidneys. The goal of treatment in this case is to reduce urinary calcium excretion. A Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor, also known as a thiazide diuretic, is often used in this situation. Thiazide diuretics reduce calcium excretion by increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule of the kidney.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\"}"
