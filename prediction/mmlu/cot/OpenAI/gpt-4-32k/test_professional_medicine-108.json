    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a nosebleed, or epistaxis, which is bleeding from the nose. The most common site of bleeding is the anterior part of the nasal septum, also known as Kiesselbach's plexus. This is consistent with the patient's examination findings. The first step in managing anterior epistaxis is to apply direct pressure by pinching the nares together for 5-15 minutes. This is often sufficient to stop the bleeding. Other options like anterior packing or catheter balloon tamponade are considered if direct pressure fails. Ice compress is not the first line of treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. pinching the nares together for 5 minutes\"}"
