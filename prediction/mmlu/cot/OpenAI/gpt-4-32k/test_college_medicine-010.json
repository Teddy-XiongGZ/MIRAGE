    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Strong acids are characterized by their ability to completely dissociate in water, meaning they break apart into their ions. This is due to the stability of their conjugate bases. The Ka value, or acid dissociation constant, is a measure of the strength of an acid in solution. For strong acids, this value is high, not less than 1. Strong acids do not remain bound in the presence of water, they dissociate. The statement about an open electron spot on their outer valence rings is more related to reactivity of elements, not specifically to acid strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
