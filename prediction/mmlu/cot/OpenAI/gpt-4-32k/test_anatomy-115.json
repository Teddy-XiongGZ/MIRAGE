    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fertilization, which is the fusion of an ovum and a sperm, does not occur in the cervix, ovary, or uterus. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus and serves as a gateway for the sperm to reach the uterus. The ovary is where the ovum is produced and released. The uterus is where the fertilized egg implants and grows into a fetus. The correct location for fertilization is the fallopian tube, which is the structure that connects the ovary to the uterus. The ovum is fertilized in the fallopian tube and then travels to the uterus to implant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fallopian tube\"}"
