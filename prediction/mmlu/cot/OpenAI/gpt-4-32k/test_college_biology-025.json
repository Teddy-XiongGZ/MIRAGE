    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of colonization of a bare substrate such as rock, sand, or glacial till by pioneer species is a type of ecological succession. There are two types of ecological succession: primary and secondary. Primary succession occurs in lifeless areas\u2014regions in which the soil is incapable of sustaining life as a result of such factors as lava flows, newly formed sand dunes, or rocks left from a retreating glacier. Secondary succession occurs in areas where a community that previously existed has been removed; it is typified by smaller-scale disturbances that do not eliminate all life and nutrients from the environment. Since the question mentions a bare substrate, it is referring to primary succession.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. primary succession\"}"
