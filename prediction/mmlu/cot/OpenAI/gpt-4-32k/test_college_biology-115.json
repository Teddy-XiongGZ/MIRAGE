    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A competitive inhibitor works by binding to the active site of an enzyme, which is the same site that the substrate would normally bind to. This prevents the substrate from binding and thus inhibits the enzyme's function. This process is reversible, meaning the inhibitor can detach from the enzyme, allowing the substrate to bind again. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect because they describe irreversible processes. Option C is incorrect because it describes a non-competitive inhibitor, which binds to a different site than the substrate. Option D is the correct answer because it describes a competitive inhibitor's function correctly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
