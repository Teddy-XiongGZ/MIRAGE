    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was given a serum that contains rabies antibodies. This means that the patient did not produce these antibodies himself, but rather they were introduced into his body. This rules out active immunity, which involves the body producing its own antibodies in response to an infection or vaccination. The antibodies were also not naturally present in the patient's body, but were artificially introduced, ruling out natural immunity. Between passive and artificial immunity, the key difference is that passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies from one individual to another, while artificial immunity involves the introduction of a vaccine or other foreign substance to stimulate an immune response. In this case, the patient was given antibodies, not a substance to stimulate his own immune response, so this is an example of passive immunity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
