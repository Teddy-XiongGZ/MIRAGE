    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Meiosis is a type of cell division that results in four daughter cells each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. It consists of two stages: Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Each of these stages has several phases: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase. Recombination, also known as crossing over, is the process where homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange segments of their genetic material. This process occurs during the Prophase I of Meiosis I.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Prophase I.\"}"
