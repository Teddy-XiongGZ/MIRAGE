    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autozygosity mapping is a technique used in genetic research to identify disease-causing genes. It is particularly useful for studying diseases that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This is because these diseases require two copies of the disease-causing gene to be present, one from each parent. Autozygosity mapping identifies regions of the genome where an individual is homozygous, meaning they have inherited the same genetic variant from both parents. This is a characteristic feature of autosomal recessive inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Autosomal recessive\"}"
