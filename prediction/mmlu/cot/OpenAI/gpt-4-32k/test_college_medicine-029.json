    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A ventricular septal defect is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. Normally, the right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood (blood with a high CO2 content and low O2 content) to the lungs to get oxygenated, and the left side of the heart receives this oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. If there is a hole in the septum, some of the oxygenated blood from the left ventricle can cross over to the right ventricle. This would increase the percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
