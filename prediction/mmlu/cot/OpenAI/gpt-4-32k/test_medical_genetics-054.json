    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transcriptional activator proteins are involved in the process of transcription, which is the first step in gene expression. They do not bind to ribosomes, which are involved in translation, not transcription. They are not specifically produced during a bacterial infection by a phage, this is more related to the process of viral replication. They also do not function in the process of translation with tRNAs. Therefore, they must bind regions near a eukaryotic gene and allow an RNA polymerase to transcribe a gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
