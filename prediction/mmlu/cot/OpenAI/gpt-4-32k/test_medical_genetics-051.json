    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A restriction enzyme that recognizes a 4 base sequence would be expected to cut the DNA every 4 bases on average. Therefore, to find out how many fragments it would create, we need to divide the total number of bases by 4. In this case, the bacteriophage has a genome size of 5,000 bp. So, 5000 divided by 4 equals 1250. However, this is not an option in the answer choices. This is because the question is asking for an average, and the probability of a specific 4 base sequence occurring is not 1/4, but 1/4^4 (1/256). Therefore, we need to divide 5000 by 256, which gives us approximately 20.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. about 20\"}"
