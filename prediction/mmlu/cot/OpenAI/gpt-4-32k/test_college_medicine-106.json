    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a molecule that plays a crucial role in energy transfer within cells. During high-intensity exercise such as sprinting, the body's demand for energy increases, leading to an increase in the breakdown of ADP. This process results in the production of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is further degraded into inosine monophosphate (IMP). IMP can then be deaminated to form hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is further oxidized to xanthine and then to uric acid. Ammonia is also produced during this process. Therefore, the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports are ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
