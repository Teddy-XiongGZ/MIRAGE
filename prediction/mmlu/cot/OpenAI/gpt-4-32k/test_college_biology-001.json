    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A frameshift mutation is a type of genetic mutation where the number of nucleotides in the DNA sequence is not a multiple of three. This can occur when a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene, which shifts the reading frame of the genetic code and can lead to the production of a completely different protein. Option A is incorrect because it refers to the removal of telomeric sequences, which is not related to frameshift mutations. Option B is incorrect because it describes a missense mutation, where a single nucleotide change results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. Option D is incorrect because it describes a nonsense mutation, where a codon is changed to a stop codon, terminating translation prematurely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
