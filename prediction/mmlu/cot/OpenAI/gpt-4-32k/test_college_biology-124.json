    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A fixed action pattern is a sequence of unlearned acts that is essentially unchangeable and, once initiated, is usually carried to completion. It is not necessarily related to the second exposure to a stimulus, so option A is incorrect. It is not dependent on the absence of sensory feedback, so option B is incorrect. While it is a motor response, it is not typically terminated spontaneously once released, so option C is incorrect. Fixed action patterns are typically triggered by specific sensory signals, known as sign stimuli or releasing stimuli, in the animal's environment, which makes option D the most accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
