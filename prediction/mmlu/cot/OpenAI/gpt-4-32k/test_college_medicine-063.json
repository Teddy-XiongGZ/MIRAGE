    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The G0 phase is a resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing. It is not a phase of mitosis or meiosis. The G2 phase is the third subphase of interphase in the cell cycle directly preceding mitosis or meiosis. It follows successful completion of S phase, during which the cell's DNA is replicated. The S phase is a period during which DNA is replicated before the cell enters mitosis or meiosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. II and III only\"}"
