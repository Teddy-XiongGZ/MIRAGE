    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polyploidy refers to the condition where an organism or cell has more than two paired sets of chromosomes. This is often induced in cells by certain agents. Penicillin is an antibiotic that kills bacteria by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, so it's not related to polyploidy. Tetracycline is also an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria, so it's not related to polyploidy either. Puromycin is an antibiotic that causes premature chain termination during translation, so it's not related to polyploidy. Colchicine, on the other hand, is a medication used to treat gout and it works by inhibiting microtubule polymerization. This prevents the formation of the mitotic spindle, which is necessary for cell division. By doing so, it can cause cells to become polyploid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Colchicine\"}"
