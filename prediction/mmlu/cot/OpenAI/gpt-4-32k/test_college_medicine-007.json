    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DFP binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase (ACE) and renders it permanently inactive. This means that the enzyme can no longer perform its function, and this effect is not reversible. This is not a case of competitive inhibition, where the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the active site, but can be displaced. It's also not noncompetitive inhibition, where the inhibitor binds to a different site and changes the shape of the enzyme, but can be removed. It's also not partially competitive inhibition, where the inhibitor can bind to both the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. Therefore, the interaction between DFP and ACE is best characterized as irreversible inhibition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
