    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of synthesizing an RNA/DNA hybrid from a single-stranded RNA template is known as reverse transcription. This process requires an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which synthesizes a DNA strand complementary to the RNA template. Additionally, a primer is needed to initiate the synthesis of the new DNA strand. This primer can be either DNA or RNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
