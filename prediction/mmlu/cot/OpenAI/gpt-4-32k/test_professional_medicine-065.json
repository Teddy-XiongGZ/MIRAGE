    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden shortness of breath, cyanosis, loss of consciousness, and bleeding from multiple sites, along with the context of being in labor, are highly suggestive of amniotic fluid embolism. This condition is a rare but serious complication of pregnancy and childbirth, characterized by the entry of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation, leading to cardiorespiratory collapse and coagulopathy. Intracerebral hemorrhage would not cause bleeding from multiple sites and would typically present with neurological symptoms. Myocardial infarction could cause sudden collapse but would not explain the bleeding. Status asthmaticus would not cause bleeding and would typically present with wheezing and prolonged respiratory distress, not sudden collapse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Amniotic fluid embolism\"}"
