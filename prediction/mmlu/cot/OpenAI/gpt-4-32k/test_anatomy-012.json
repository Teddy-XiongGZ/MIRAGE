    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint is a unique joint in the body. It does have an articular disc, but it is not made of hyaline cartilage, it is made of fibrocartilage, so option A is incorrect. The articular surfaces of the temporomandibular joint are also covered by fibrocartilage, not hyaline cartilage, so option B is incorrect. Proprioceptive information is not carried by the chorda tympani and deep temporal nerves, so option C is incorrect. The masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves do carry proprioceptive information from the temporomandibular joint, so option D is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
