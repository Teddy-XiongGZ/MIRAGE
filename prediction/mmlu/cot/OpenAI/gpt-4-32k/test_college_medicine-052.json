    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy expenditure during exercise can be calculated using the formula: VO2 (l/min) x duration (min) x 21 kJ/l O2. Here, VO2 is the volume of oxygen consumed per minute. In this case, VO2 is 3.0 l/min and the duration is 5 minutes. So, the energy expenditure is 3.0 l/min x 5 min x 21 kJ/l O2 = 315 kJ. However, this value is not in the options. The closest value to 315 kJ is 300 kJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
