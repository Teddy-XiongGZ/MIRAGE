    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, pain, swelling, warmth, and erythema in the knee joint, especially after a history of trauma, are suggestive of septic arthritis until proven otherwise. Septic arthritis is a medical emergency because delay in treatment can lead to rapid joint destruction. The most appropriate next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis by analyzing the synovial fluid obtained from the joint aspiration (arthrocentesis). This procedure will allow for culture of the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. Other options like nuclear scan or MRI, although can provide information about the joint, they do not provide immediate diagnostic information necessary for the management of this patient. Starting antibiotics without confirming the diagnosis and identifying the causative organism is not the best approach.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Arthrocentesis\"}"
