    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA polymerase creates new DNA by adding complimentary nucleotides to a template strand. In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) and vice versa. Therefore, if the template strand had a ratio of 3:2 of A:T, the newly synthesized complimentary strand will have a ratio of 2:3 of A:T, because the number of adenines in the new strand will be equal to the number of thymines in the template, and the number of thymines in the new strand will be equal to the number of adenines in the template.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 2:03\"}"
