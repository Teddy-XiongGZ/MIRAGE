    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sternum is located in the upper part of the abdomen. The epigastric region is the upper central region of the abdomen. It is located below (distal to) the sternum and above the umbilicus. The hypochondriac regions are on the sides of the epigastric region, not directly below the sternum. The hypogastric region is located below the umbilicus, so it's not directly distal to the sternum. The lumbar regions are on the sides of the umbilicus, so they are also not directly distal to the sternum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Epigastric\"}"
