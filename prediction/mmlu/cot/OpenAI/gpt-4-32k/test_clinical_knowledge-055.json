    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total dose in milligrams. This is done by multiplying the person's weight in kg by the dose in mg/kg. So, 62 kg * 15 mg/kg = 930 mg. However, the question asks for the dose in grams. Since 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams, we need to convert 930 mg to grams by dividing by 1000. So, 930 mg / 1000 = 0.93 grams.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 0.93\"}"
