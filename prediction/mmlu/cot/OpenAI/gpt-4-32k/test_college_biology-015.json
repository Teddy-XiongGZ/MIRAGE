    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a process that occurs after the sperm has penetrated the egg's outer layers and has triggered a rise in intracellular free calcium. This rise in calcium then triggers the release of enzymes that prevent other sperm from fertilizing the same egg, a process known as polyspermy. This is not the zona reaction, which involves the hardening of the zona pellucida, the outer layer of the egg. It's also not the acrosomal reaction, which involves the release of enzymes from the sperm's acrosome to penetrate the egg's outer layers. The fertilization reaction is a general term for the entire process of fertilization, not specifically the prevention of polyspermy. Therefore, the process described is the cortical reaction, which specifically refers to the release of enzymes to prevent polyspermy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. cortical reaction\"}"
