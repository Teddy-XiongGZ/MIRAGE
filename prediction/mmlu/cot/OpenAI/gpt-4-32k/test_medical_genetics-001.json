    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are both types of proteins that have specific structures allowing them to bind to DNA. They are not involved in the control of translation, which is the process of synthesizing proteins from mRNA. They are also not components of ribosomes, which are the sites of protein synthesis in the cell. Lastly, they are not part of the hemoglobin in blood cells, which is a protein that carries oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
