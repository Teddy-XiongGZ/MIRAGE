    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A hypertonic solution is defined by its solute concentration in comparison to another solution. In the context of human cells, a hypertonic solution would have a higher concentration of solutes than the cell. This would cause water to move out of the cell to try to balance the concentration of solutes, which can cause the cell to shrink. The other options do not correctly define a hypertonic solution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
