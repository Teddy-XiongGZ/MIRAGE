    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total micrograms per minute for a 65 kg person. This is done by multiplying the rate (4 micrograms/kg/min) by the weight (65 kg), which gives us 260 micrograms/min. Then, to find out how many micrograms they receive in an hour, we multiply this by the number of minutes in an hour (60), which gives us 15600 micrograms. Finally, to convert this to milligrams, we divide by the number of micrograms in a milligram (1000), which gives us 15.6 milligrams.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
