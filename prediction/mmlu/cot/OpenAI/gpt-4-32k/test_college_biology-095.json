    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"C4 plants fix CO2 in the mesophyll cells and then transfer it to the bundle sheath cells where the Calvin cycle takes place. This is a mechanism to concentrate CO2 and reduce photorespiration. On the other hand, CAM plants fix CO2 during the night when the stomata are open and store it as malate in the vacuoles. During the day, when the stomata are closed to prevent water loss, the stored CO2 is released and used in the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll cells. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect these processes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
