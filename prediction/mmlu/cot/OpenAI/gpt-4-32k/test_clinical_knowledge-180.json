    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Blood pressure changes are primarily detected by baroreceptors. These are specialized neurons located in the walls of certain blood vessels, particularly the aorta and carotid arteries, that sense changes in blood pressure. Chemoreceptors are more involved in detecting changes in the chemical composition of the blood, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. The vasomotor and cardiovascular centres are parts of the brain that respond to information from the baroreceptors and other sensors to regulate blood pressure, but they do not directly detect changes in blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
