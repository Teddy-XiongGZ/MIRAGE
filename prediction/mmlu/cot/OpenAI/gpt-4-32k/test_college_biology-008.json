    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Punctuated equilibrium is a theory in evolutionary biology which proposes that most species will exhibit little net evolutionary change for most of their geological history, remaining in an extended state called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and rapid events of branching speciation. So, it's not about ecological successional stages, sudden environmental changes, or predator-prey relationships.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
