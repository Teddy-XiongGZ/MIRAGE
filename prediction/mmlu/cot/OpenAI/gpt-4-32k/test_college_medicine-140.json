    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand what happens in each stage of mitosis. Prophase is the first stage of mitosis where the chromatin condenses into chromosomes, and the nucleolus disappears or dissolves. So, the statement 'Prophase \u2014 Dissolution of nucleoli' is correct. Now, let's look at the options. Metaphase is the stage where chromosomes align at the equatorial plate, not the formation of two distinct nuclear membranes. Cytokinesis is the stage where the cytoplasm and organelles are separated into two new cells, not the separation of sister chromatids. Telophase is the stage where two distinct nuclear membranes form around each set of chromosomes, not the formation of the equatorial plate. Anaphase is the stage where sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles, not the separation of the cytoplasm and organelles. Therefore, none of the options match the statement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
