    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping, and high BMI suggest obstructive sleep apnea. This condition is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to intermittent hypoxia and frequent arousals. The gold standard for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea is polysomnography, which records multiple body functions during sleep, including brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, body movement, and more. The other options like 24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring and CT scan of the head are not specific for diagnosing sleep apnea. The multiple sleep latency test is used to diagnose narcolepsy, not sleep apnea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Polysomnography\"}"
