    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The creatine kinase reaction is a reversible reaction that helps to maintain the energy balance in tissues that have high, fluctuating energy demands, such as muscle and brain. It is not slow compared to glycolysis, but rather it is a rapid reaction that helps to quickly generate ATP. It is not true that it is not activated until all the ATP has been used up. The reaction is actually in equilibrium, and the direction of the reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactants and products. Finally, the reaction is not inhibited by low pH in the muscle. Instead, the reaction can actually help to buffer the pH in the muscle by consuming protons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
