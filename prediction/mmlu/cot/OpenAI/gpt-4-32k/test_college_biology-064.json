    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ventricular stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart in one contraction. The venous side of the circulation is more compliant, meaning it can accommodate a larger volume of blood with less change in pressure. On the other hand, the arterial side is less compliant, meaning a given increase in volume will result in a larger increase in pressure. Therefore, when a volume of blood equivalent to the ventricular stroke volume is transferred from the venous to the arterial side, there would be little effect on the venous pressure due to its high compliance, but a significant increase in the arterial pressure due to its low compliance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
