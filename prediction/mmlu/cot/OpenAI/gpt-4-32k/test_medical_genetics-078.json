    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In eukaryotes, the initial RNA transcript, also known as pre-mRNA, undergoes several modifications before it is translated into a protein. These modifications include the addition of a 5\u2019 cap and a 3\u2019 Poly A tail, which are not removed before translation. The ribosome binding site is not a component of the RNA transcript, but rather a region on the mRNA where the ribosome binds during translation. Introns, on the other hand, are non-coding regions of the RNA transcript that are removed during RNA splicing, a process that occurs before translation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
