    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Homeotic cluster genes, also known as Hox genes, are a group of related genes that control the body plan of an embryo along the head-tail axis. They do this by controlling the developmental fate of groups of cells. A mutation in these genes can lead to a transformation of one body segment into another. For example, a mutation in a Hox gene in Drosophila can result in the transformation of an antenna into a leg. The other options do not accurately describe the effects of a mutation in homeotic cluster genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
