    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's physical examination findings (eg, systolic murmur along the left sternal border, weak femoral pulses, radiofemoral delay) and imaging results (eg, cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence, left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG) are suggestive of aortic coarctation. This is a congenital condition characterized by a narrowing of the aorta, which leads to obstruction of blood flow. The upper body receives blood flow before the site of the coarctation, resulting in increased blood pressure and strong pulses in the upper extremities. The lower body, however, receives blood flow after the site of the coarctation, resulting in decreased blood pressure and weak, delayed pulses in the lower extremities. Over time, the increased workload on the left ventricle can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy. The most common complication of untreated aortic coarctation is systemic hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Systemic hypertension\"}"
