    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration are suggestive of hypoglycemia, which is confirmed by her low serum glucose concentration. The fact that her symptoms improve after ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks, which are high in sugar, further supports this. The most common cause of hypoglycemia in adults is an insulinoma, a tumor that produces insulin. To confirm this diagnosis, we would need to measure serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations. C-peptide is a byproduct of insulin production, so high levels of both would suggest an insulinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations\"}"
