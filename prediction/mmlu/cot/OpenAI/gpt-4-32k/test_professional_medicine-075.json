    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has systemic sclerosis, which is a connective tissue disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs. The symptoms of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and crackles in the lower lung fields suggest a lung involvement. Pulmonary function tests show a reduced total lung capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, which are indicative of a restrictive lung disease and impaired gas exchange, respectively. These findings are consistent with interstitial lung disease, a common pulmonary manifestation of systemic sclerosis. Histologically, interstitial lung disease is characterized by diffuse interstitial fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis\"}"
