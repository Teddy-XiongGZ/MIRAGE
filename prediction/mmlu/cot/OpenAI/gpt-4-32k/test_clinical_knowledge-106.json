    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sex of a child is determined by the combination of sex chromosomes they inherit from their parents. Females have two X chromosomes and can only pass on an X chromosome to their offspring. Males have one X and one Y chromosome and can pass on either an X or a Y chromosome. If a child inherits an X chromosome from the father, they will be female (XX). If they inherit a Y chromosome from the father, they will be male (XY). Therefore, the sex of a child is determined by the Y chromosome from the father.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
