    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A karyotype is a visual profile of all the chromosomes in a cell. The normal human karyotype contains 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. The notation 47,XY,+13 means there is an extra chromosome 13 (trisomy 13), 47,XX,+18 means there is an extra chromosome 18 (trisomy 18), 47,XY,+21 means there is an extra chromosome 21 (trisomy 21 or Down syndrome), and 45,Y means there is only one sex chromosome, the Y chromosome. Trisomy 13, 18, and 21 are all compatible with survival to birth, although they are associated with severe developmental problems and often early death. However, the absence of an X chromosome (45,Y) is not compatible with survival to birth because the X chromosome carries essential genes for development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
