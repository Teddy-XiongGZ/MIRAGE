    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate of gas diffusion between the alveoli and the blood within a pulmonary capillary is influenced by several factors. These include the partial pressure gradient of the gas, the solubility of the gas in water, the total surface area available for diffusion, and the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary. Decreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas or decreasing the solubility of the gas in water would decrease the rate of diffusion. Decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary would also decrease the rate of diffusion. However, increasing the total surface area available for diffusion would increase the rate of diffusion, as it would provide more space for the gas to move between the alveoli and the blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
