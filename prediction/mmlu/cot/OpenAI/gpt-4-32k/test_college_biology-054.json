    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Linkage disequilibrium refers to the non-random association of alleles at different loci. Factors that promote linkage disequilibrium include asexual reproduction, which does not involve recombination, coadapted gene complexes, where certain combinations of alleles work well together, and epistasis, where one gene affects the expression of another. Random mating, on the other hand, promotes recombination and independent assortment, which disrupt linkage disequilibrium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Random mating\"}"
