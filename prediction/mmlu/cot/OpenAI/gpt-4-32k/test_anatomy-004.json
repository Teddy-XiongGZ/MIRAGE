    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. It consists of several parts, including the afferent arteriole, glomerulus, loop of Henle, and renal pelvis. The afferent arteriole is the blood vessel that brings blood to the nephron. The loop of Henle is a part of the nephron where urine concentration takes place. The renal pelvis is a funnel-shaped space in the kidney that collects urine. The glomerulus, on the other hand, is a network of tiny blood vessels, or capillaries, where the filtration of blood takes place. Therefore, the cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron in the kidney is the glomerulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
