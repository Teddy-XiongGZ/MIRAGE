    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Early Warning Score (EWS) is a guide used by medical services to quickly determine the degree of illness of a patient. It is not limited to a specific age group, so option A is incorrect. It is also not limited to patients admitted to the Emergency Department, so option B is incorrect. Similarly, it is not only for patients who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit, so option C is incorrect. The EWS is used for any patient who is acutely unwell, including pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery, so option D is the most accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
