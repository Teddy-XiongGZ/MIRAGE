    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The right atrioventricular valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is not a semilunar valve, so option A is incorrect. The semilunar valves are the aortic and pulmonary valves. The right atrioventricular valve is not open during systole, it is closed to prevent backflow of blood into the right atrium as the right ventricle contracts, so option C is incorrect. The right atrioventricular valve does not prevent blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes, that's the function of the pulmonary valve, so option D is incorrect. The right atrioventricular valve is indeed prevented from everting by the papillary muscles. These muscles contract to prevent the valve leaflets from everting into the right atrium when the right ventricle contracts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
