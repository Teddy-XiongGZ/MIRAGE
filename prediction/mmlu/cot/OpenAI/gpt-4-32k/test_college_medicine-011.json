    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reaction described is an elimination reaction, where 2-bromobutane is converted into butene. The major product, 2-butene, is formed due to the Zaitsev's rule, which states that in an elimination reaction, the more substituted alkene\u2014meaning the alkene with the most alkyl groups attached to the carbons of the double bond\u2014will be the major product. In this case, 2-butene is more substituted than 1-butene, hence it is the major product. None of the options directly refer to Zaitsev's rule, but option A indirectly refers to it by stating that carbon 3 has less hydrogen atoms, which means that carbon 2 is more substituted.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
