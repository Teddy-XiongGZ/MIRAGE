    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. It is caused by a loss of function in the UBE3A gene on the maternally inherited chromosome 15. This can occur through several mechanisms, including deletion of the maternal copy of the gene, mutations in the UBE3A gene itself, or uniparental disomy (UPD), where an individual inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from the father and none from the mother. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that involves a problem with the maternal chromosome 15.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Maternal UPD 15\"}"
