    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart in one contraction. It is regulated by three main factors: preload, contractility, and afterload. Preload refers to the degree of stretch of the heart muscle at the end of diastole. Contractility is the inherent vigor of contraction of the heart muscles, independent of the preload. Afterload is the pressure against which the heart must work to eject blood during systole. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that includes these three factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Preload, contractility, and afterload.\"}"
