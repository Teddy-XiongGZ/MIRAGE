    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The World Systems Theory categorizes countries based on their economic and political structures. Core countries are typically developed and diversified economies with strong central governments. Periphery countries are often less developed, with economies centered around one natural resource. Semi-periphery countries fall in between, having characteristics of both core and periphery countries. They are often in the process of industrializing and diversifying their economies, but they do not have the same level of economic stability or political power as core countries. Therefore, the answer that correlates best with semi-periphery countries is a diversified and developed economy, but not to the extent of core countries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
