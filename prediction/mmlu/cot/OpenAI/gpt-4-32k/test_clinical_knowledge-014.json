    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the two main contractile proteins in skeletal muscle. Contractile proteins are responsible for muscle contraction. Actin and myosin are the two proteins that interact to cause this contraction, with myosin pulling on actin to shorten the muscle. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory proteins that control the interaction between actin and myosin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. actin and myosin.\"}"
