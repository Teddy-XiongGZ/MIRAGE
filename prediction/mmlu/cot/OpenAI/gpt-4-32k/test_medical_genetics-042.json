    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, inherited disorder. It causes too much of a fatty substance to build up in tissues and nerves of the brain. This buildup destroys nerve cells, causing mental and physical problems. The disease is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme called Hexosaminidase A, which helps break down this fatty substance. Alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency leads to Hurler syndrome, Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency leads to Von Gierke disease, and Homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency leads to Alkaptonuria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
