    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of creatine and uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to create phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This reaction is reversible, so when ADP levels rise, the reaction can go in the opposite direction to produce more ATP. Therefore, the activity of creatine kinase would increase when intracellular ADP rises. The other options are not necessarily true. The activity of creatine kinase is not directly related to muscle pH, it's not always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres, and it's not necessarily increased after a period of endurance training.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
