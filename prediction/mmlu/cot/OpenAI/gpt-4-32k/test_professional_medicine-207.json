    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the body needs to deliver more oxygen to the muscles, which is achieved by increasing the cardiac output. This is done by increasing both the heart rate and the stroke volume. Therefore, the stroke volume is not likely to decrease. The systolic blood pressure is also likely to increase due to the increased cardiac output. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and it is likely to increase due to the increased stroke volume and systolic blood pressure. The total peripheral resistance, however, is likely to decrease. This is because during exercise, the blood vessels in the muscles dilate to allow more blood flow to the muscles. This dilation decreases the total peripheral resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Total peripheral resistance\"}"
