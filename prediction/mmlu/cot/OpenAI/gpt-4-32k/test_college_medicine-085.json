    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is a key enzyme complex in the metabolic pathway. It is not located in the sarcoplasm, which is the cytoplasm of a muscle cell. Instead, it is located in the mitochondria. It does not catalyse the conversion of pyruvate to lactate or lactate to pyruvate. Instead, it catalyses the conversion of pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, into acetyl CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
