    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bilirubin is a waste product that is produced by the liver when it breaks down old red blood cells. The liver also manufactures plasma proteins and is involved in the production of prothrombin and fibrinogen, which are essential for blood clotting. The gallbladder stores bile, not bilirubin, and does not produce plasma proteins or clotting factors. The kidney filters waste from the blood but does not produce plasma proteins or clotting factors. The spleen filters old red blood cells from the blood but does not produce plasma proteins or clotting factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Liver\"}"
