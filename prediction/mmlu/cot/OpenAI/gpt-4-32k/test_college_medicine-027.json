    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This is a physics problem involving the forces acting on an object on an inclined plane. The acceleration of the object is determined by the net force acting on it, which is the difference between the force of gravity pulling it down the slope and the force of friction resisting its motion. The force of gravity acting down the slope is g sin ?, while the force of friction is \u00b5 times the normal force, which is g cos ?. Therefore, the net force, and hence the acceleration, is the force of gravity down the slope minus the force of friction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
