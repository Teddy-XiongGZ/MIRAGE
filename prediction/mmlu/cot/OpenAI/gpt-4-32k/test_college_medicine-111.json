    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is about the gas laws, specifically Boyle's law, which states that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship when temperature is held constant. In this case, the pressure is decreasing from 200atm to 1atm, so the volume should increase. The relationship is directly proportional, so if the pressure decreases by a factor of 200, the volume should increase by a factor of 200. Therefore, 0.1L * 200 = 20L.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 20L\"}"
