    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrogen ions are formed during the process of glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP. This process also produces pyruvate. When the body is under stress or lacks oxygen, pyruvate is converted to lactate, and this process also releases hydrogen ions. Therefore, the formation of hydrogen ions is associated with the conversion of pyruvate to lactate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
