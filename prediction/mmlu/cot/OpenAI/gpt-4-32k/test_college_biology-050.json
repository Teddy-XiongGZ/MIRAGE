    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chemosynthetic bacteria are organisms that use inorganic molecules as a source of energy, instead of sunlight. They do this through a process called chemosynthesis, which involves the oxidation of inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen. This is different from photosynthesis, where light energy is converted into chemical energy. Therefore, the process of chemosynthesis does not involve the reduction of inorganic substances or the oxidation of organic compounds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
