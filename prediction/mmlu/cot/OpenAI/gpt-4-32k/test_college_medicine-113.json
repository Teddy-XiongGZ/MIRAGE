    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium bicarbonate ingestion is known to improve athletic performance, particularly in middle distance running. This is because sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer in the body, helping to regulate pH levels. When we exercise, our muscles produce lactic acid which can lower the pH in our bodies and cause fatigue. Sodium bicarbonate helps to neutralize this acid, thereby reducing fatigue and improving performance. This is achieved by elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, which allows for a faster efflux, or outflow, of hydrogen ions from the muscle. This process helps to maintain the pH balance in the muscles, allowing them to function more effectively during exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
