    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has developed bilateral breast enlargement over the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight, which is normal for his age. His physical examination shows normal penis and testes, and his pubic hair development is at Tanner stage 3, which is also normal for his age. His serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. This rules out conditions such as Leydig cell tumor, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome, which would cause abnormal hormone levels. Therefore, the most likely cause of his breast enlargement is normal development, also known as pubertal gynecomastia, which is a common condition in adolescent boys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
