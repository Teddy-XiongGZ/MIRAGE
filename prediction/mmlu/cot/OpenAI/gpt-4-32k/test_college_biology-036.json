    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A sarcomere is the basic unit of a muscle's cross-striated myofibril. A. During contraction, H zones actually shorten, not elongate. B. Tropomyosin does indeed block the myosin binding sites on actin when the muscle is relaxed. C. The myosin head, not the tail, contains the actin binding site and the ATP-hydrolyzing site. D. Troponin and tropomyosin are part of the thin filament structure, but they do not constitute the thick and thin filaments respectively. The thick filament is primarily made of myosin, and the thin filament is primarily made of actin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
