    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The chloroplast is a type of organelle known as a plastid that's involved in photosynthesis. It has a double membrane structure, consisting of an inner and an outer membrane. Inside the inner membrane, there are thylakoid membranes where the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur. Therefore, starting from the innermost membrane, the sequence should be thylakoid membrane, inner membrane, and then outer membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
