    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A killed vaccine is a vaccine that contains viruses that have been 'killed' or 'inactivated' but still stimulate an immune response. The main advantage of killed vaccines is that they cannot cause the disease they are designed to prevent, because the virus is not alive and cannot replicate. This is particularly important when dealing with a new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus, as we would want to avoid any potential for the vaccine to revert to a virulent form and cause the disease it is supposed to prevent. On the other hand, live vaccines can sometimes revert to a virulent form and cause disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness is to avoid the concern for reversion to virulence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
