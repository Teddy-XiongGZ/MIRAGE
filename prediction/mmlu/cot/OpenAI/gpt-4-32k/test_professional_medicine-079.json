    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's behavior is characterized by seeing things as all good or all bad, with no in-between. This is a defense mechanism known as splitting, where individuals are unable to integrate the good and bad aspects of self or others into a whole image. The patient sees one of his children as worthless (all bad) and the others as presumably good. This is not projection, where the individual attributes their own unacceptable feelings to someone else. It's also not projective identification, where the individual induces feelings or impulses which are personally unacceptable in another person. Lastly, it's not reaction formation, where the individual behaves in the exact opposite way to his or her true feelings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Splitting\"}"
