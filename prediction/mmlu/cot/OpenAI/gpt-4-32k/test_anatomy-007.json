    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osteoblasts are cells that produce bone, so they are not directly involved in the body's defense against bacteria. Hair in the nose does help to filter out particles, including bacteria, from the air we breathe, but it is not the primary defense mechanism. Saliva contains enzymes that can kill bacteria, but it is also not the primary defense. Mucous membranes, on the other hand, line many parts of the body including the nose, mouth, and lungs, and they produce mucus which can trap bacteria and other particles. Therefore, mucous membranes are the body's primary defense against environmental bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mucous membranes\"}"
