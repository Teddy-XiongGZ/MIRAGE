    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms indicate that his asthma is not well controlled, as he is using his albuterol inhaler daily. Albuterol is a short-acting \u03b22-agonist (SABA) used for quick relief of acute symptoms and prevention of exercise-induced asthma. Overuse of SABA (eg, daily, more than 2 days/week) is a sign of poor asthma control and indicates the need for additional long-term control therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective long-term control therapy for persistent asthma. They reduce inflammation, decrease airway hyperresponsiveness, and inhibit inflammatory cell migration and activation. Therefore, the most appropriate management would be to initiate a daily corticosteroid inhaler. A chest x-ray is not necessary as the patient's symptoms are consistent with asthma and there are no signs of other conditions. Fexofenadine therapy is used for allergic rhinitis, not asthma. Increasing the use of the albuterol inhaler would not address the underlying inflammation causing the asthma symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler\"}"
