    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"HLA, or human leukocyte antigen, is a type of molecule found on the surface of cells that plays a crucial role in the immune system's recognition of self and non-self. HLA haplotypes are inherited, with one set coming from each parent. Therefore, a person shares one HLA haplotype with each parent. However, siblings have a 25% chance of inheriting the same two HLA haplotypes, making them a complete match. Therefore, an individual is most likely to share a common HLA haplotype with a sibling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Sister\"}"
