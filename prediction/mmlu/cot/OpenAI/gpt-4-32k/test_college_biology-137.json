    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The atmosphere, while it does contain a significant amount of carbon, is not the largest pool. Rain-forest vegetation and recoverable fossil fuels also contain carbon, but these are not the largest pools either.

Therefore, the oceans are the largest active pool of carbon on Earth and contribute the most to carbon cycling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
