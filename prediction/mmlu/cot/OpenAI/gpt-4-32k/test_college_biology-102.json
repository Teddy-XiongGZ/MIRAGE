    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The alpha helix is a common secondary structure in proteins. The structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen of one amino acid and the amide hydrogen of another amino acid, which are part of the peptide backbone. Disulfide bridges between cysteine side chains are important for tertiary structure, not secondary. Carbohydrate moieties attached to polar amino acids are related to post-translational modifications, not the stabilization of the alpha helix. Peptide linkages that covalently bond amino acids are responsible for the primary structure of proteins, not the secondary structure like alpha helix.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
