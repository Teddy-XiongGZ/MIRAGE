    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, and confusion, along with the findings of bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI and mononuclear pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, are suggestive of encephalitis. Bacterial meningitis typically presents with neck stiffness, photophobia, and a predominance of neutrophils in the cerebrospinal fluid, which are not seen in this case. Dextromethorphan intoxication would not explain the MRI findings or the cerebrospinal fluid analysis. HIV encephalopathy is a possibility, but it usually occurs in the later stages of HIV infection and is less likely in a previously healthy individual. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis worldwide. It typically presents with fever, headache, altered mental status, and seizures. The MRI findings of bitemporal hyperintensities are characteristic of herpes simplex encephalitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Herpes simplex encephalitis\"}"
