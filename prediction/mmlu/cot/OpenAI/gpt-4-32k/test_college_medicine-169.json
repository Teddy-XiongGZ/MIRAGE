    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA replication is a complex process that involves several enzymes. DNA polymerase I and III are involved in the replication process, but they are not primarily responsible for error correction. The mismatch repair mechanism is responsible for correcting errors that occur during DNA replication, but it does not specifically target errors that occur shortly after the RNA primer is removed. The enzyme that is responsible for removing incorrect bases shortly after the RNA primer is removed is DNA polymerase I, as it has both 5'-3' polymerase activity and 5'-3' exonuclease activity, which allows it to replace the RNA primer with DNA and correct errors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. DNA polymerase I\"}"
