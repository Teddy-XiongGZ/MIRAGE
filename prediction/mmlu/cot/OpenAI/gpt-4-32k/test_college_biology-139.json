    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cohesion-tension theory explains the mechanism of water movement in plants, particularly from roots to leaves through the xylem. This theory is based on two main principles: cohesion and tension. Cohesion refers to the property of water molecules sticking together, which allows them to form a continuous water column in the xylem. Tension, on the other hand, is created by the evaporation of water from the leaves, a process known as transpiration. This tension pulls the water column upwards from the roots to the leaves. The theory does not involve the movement of water from high to low hydrostatic pressure regions, nor does it involve the formation of embolisms. Also, the xylem is composed of dead cells, not living cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
