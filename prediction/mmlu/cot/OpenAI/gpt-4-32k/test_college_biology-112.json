    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optimality theory in evolutionary biology suggests that an evolutionary strategy is optimal if it maximizes the difference between benefits and costs. This means that the trait that provides the best return for its cost, compared to alternative forms of the trait, will be the one that is selected for. This doesn't necessarily mean that the benefits always outweigh the costs, as suggested in option A and C. It also doesn't mean that the relative fitness of an organism must be improved due to a specific trait for it to remain in the gene pool, as suggested in option D. It's about the balance between the benefits and costs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
