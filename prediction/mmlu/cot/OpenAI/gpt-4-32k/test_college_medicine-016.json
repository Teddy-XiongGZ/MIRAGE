    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of transcription, which involves the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) from a DNA template, occurs within the nucleus of a cell. This is because the DNA is located in the nucleus and it is where the necessary enzymes for transcription, such as RNA polymerase, are found. The mRNA then exits the nucleus to be translated into protein in the cytoplasm. Therefore, the transcription does not occur on the ribosomes, in the cytosol, or only during cell division.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
