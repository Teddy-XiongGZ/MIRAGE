    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein produced by the fetal liver and yolk sac. In pregnancies, the maternal serum level of AFP can be used as a marker for certain fetal conditions. In Down syndrome, the AFP level is typically lower than average. Exomphalos and neural tube defects are associated with higher levels of AFP, not lower. Twin pregnancies can also lead to higher levels of AFP because there are two fetuses producing the protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Down syndrome\"}"
