    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's tremor has been present for most of her life, but it has worsened recently. This suggests that the tremor is not a new symptom, but rather an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. Parkinson's disease typically presents with a resting tremor, which is not the case here. Bereavement reaction could potentially cause an increase in stress, which could exacerbate a tremor, but it would not likely cause the tremor itself. An adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy could potentially cause tremor, but it would be unusual for it to exacerbate a pre-existing tremor to this extent. The patient has increased her alcohol consumption recently, and she reports that the alcohol reduces her tremor. This suggests that the tremor may be a form of essential tremor, which is known to be reduced by alcohol consumption. The increase in the tremor could be due to the fact that the patient is now drinking alcohol daily, which could be causing a rebound effect when the alcohol wears off.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increase in alcohol consumption\"}"
