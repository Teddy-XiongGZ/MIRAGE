    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary motor cortex is responsible for initiating voluntary movements. It is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. The neurons in the primary motor cortex send their axons down to the spinal cord to synapse on motor neurons, which then stimulate muscle contraction. The primary motor cortex is organized somatotopically, meaning that specific areas of the cortex correspond to specific parts of the body. Importantly, the primary motor cortex controls the opposite side of the body, due to the decussation (crossing over) of the corticospinal tract in the medulla. Therefore, activity in the primary motor cortex results in contraction of contralateral limb musculature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. contraction of contralateral limb musculature.\"}"
