    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Palatine shelf elevation is a process that occurs during the development of the palate in the embryo. This process is influenced by several factors. The descent of the tongue, for instance, creates space for the palatine shelves to elevate and fuse. Changes in the flexure of the developing brain can also influence the position and orientation of the palatine shelves. Hydrophilic molecules can increase turgor pressure in the palatine shelves, contributing to their elevation. Therefore, all these processes play a role in palatine shelf elevation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
