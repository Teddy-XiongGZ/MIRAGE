    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that females can be carriers of the disease. The patient's brother and maternal uncle had DMD, which suggests that the disease is present in her family. However, the patient's normal creatine kinase concentration does not necessarily mean she is not a carrier. Creatine kinase levels can be normal in carriers of DMD. The patient's mother has an elevated creatine kinase concentration, which could suggest that she is a carrier. However, the patient's carrier status cannot be definitively determined based on her family history and creatine kinase concentration alone. Random X inactivation, also known as lyonization, can lead to variable expression of X-linked disorders in female carriers, making it difficult to predict carrier status based on clinical or laboratory findings alone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation\"}"
