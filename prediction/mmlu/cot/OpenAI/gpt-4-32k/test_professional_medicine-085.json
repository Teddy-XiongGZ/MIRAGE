    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Codeine is a prodrug that requires conversion to morphine by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 to produce its analgesic effect. Some individuals are poor metabolizers of codeine due to decreased CYP2D6 activity, which can be due to genetic polymorphisms. This would result in decreased conversion of codeine to morphine, leading to poor pain control. The fact that other family members also have poor pain control with codeine suggests a genetic factor, which further supports this explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\"}"
