    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cell nucleus is the control center of the cell, and it contains the cell's DNA, which is the genetic material. It also contains proteins, which are involved in various functions such as DNA replication and gene expression. RNA, specifically mRNA, is also present in the nucleus as it is transcribed from the DNA before it is transported out of the nucleus to be translated into proteins. Therefore, the nucleus contains DNA, protein, and RNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
