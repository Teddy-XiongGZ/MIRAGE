    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During intense physical activities like soccer, the body's demand for energy increases. This energy is produced through the breakdown of glucose in a process called glycolysis. When the demand for energy exceeds the oxygen supply, the body switches to anaerobic glycolysis, which results in the production of lactate. As the game progresses and players become more fatigued, the demand for energy continues to increase, leading to an increase in blood lactate concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half.\"}"
