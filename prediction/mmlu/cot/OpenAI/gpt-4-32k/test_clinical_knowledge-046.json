    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a DNA molecule, the purines are adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidines are cytosine (C) and thymine (T). According to the base pairing rule in DNA, A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C. This means that the number of purines (A and G) is always equal to the number of pyrimidines (C and T). Therefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is always 1:1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
