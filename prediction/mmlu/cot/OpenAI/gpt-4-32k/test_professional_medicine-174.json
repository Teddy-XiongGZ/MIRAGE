    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of recurrent injuries, joint hypermobility, tall stature, and ocular problems (necessity for glasses) suggest a connective tissue disorder. The family history of aortic aneurysm and severe rotator cuff injury further supports this. The most likely diagnosis is Marfan syndrome, a disorder of fibrillin, a glycoprotein that is a major component of the extracellular matrix and is important in the formation of elastic fibers. Cardiovascular abnormalities, particularly mitral valve prolapse and aortic root dilatation, are common in Marfan syndrome and can be life-threatening. The midsystolic click heard during the physical examination is suggestive of mitral valve prolapse. Therefore, the next step in diagnosis should be to evaluate the cardiovascular system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Echocardiography\"}"
