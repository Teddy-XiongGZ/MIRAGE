    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy molecules ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Glycogen can also be broken down into glucose before entering the glycolysis pathway. The end product of glycolysis can be either pyruvate in aerobic conditions or lactate in anaerobic conditions. Acetyl CoA is not a direct product of glycolysis, it is produced in the next step of cellular respiration, the citric acid cycle, after pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. glycogen or glucose to pyruvate or lactate.\"}"
