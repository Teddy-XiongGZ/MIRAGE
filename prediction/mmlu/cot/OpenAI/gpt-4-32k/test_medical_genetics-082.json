    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microsatellite instability is a condition that is caused by defects in the DNA mismatch repair system. This leads to an increased rate of mutations, particularly in areas of the DNA known as microsatellites. Familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by mutations in the APC gene, not by microsatellite instability. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and neurofibromatosis 1 are also not associated with microsatellite instability. However, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, is characterized by microsatellite instability due to mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
