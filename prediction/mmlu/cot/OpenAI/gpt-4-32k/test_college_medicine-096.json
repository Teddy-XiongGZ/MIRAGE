    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noncompetitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme, not the active site, and their binding is not influenced by the concentration of the substrate. Therefore, increasing the substrate concentration would not affect the impact of a noncompetitive inhibitor. On the other hand, uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex. This means that the more substrate is present, the more enzyme-substrate complexes are formed, and the more uncompetitive inhibitor can bind, increasing its impact.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increasing impact of uncompetitive inhibitor\"}"
