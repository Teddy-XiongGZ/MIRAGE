    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a fracture where the bone is bent but not displaced, and the skin is intact. This rules out options C and D, as they describe open fractures where the skin is broken. A comminuted fracture, as in option B, involves the bone breaking into several pieces, which is not the case here. A greenstick fracture is one where the bone bends and breaks, similar to how a green stick would break, but does not completely separate. This is common in children, as their bones are more flexible. The fact that the skin is intact indicates that the fracture is closed, meaning the bone did not break through the skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
