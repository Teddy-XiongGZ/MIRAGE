    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hardy-Weinberg law is a principle that states that both allele and genotype frequencies in a population remain constant from generation to generation unless specific disturbing influences are introduced. These influences include genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, selection, and meiotic drive. Therefore, for the Hardy-Weinberg law to operate, the population size must be large to minimize the effects of genetic drift (B), natural selection should not take place (C), and matings should be random (D). However, genes should not be exchanged with other populations (A) because this would introduce new alleles into the population, disrupting the equilibrium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
