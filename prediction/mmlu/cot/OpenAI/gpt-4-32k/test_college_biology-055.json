    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The gray crescent in amphibian zygotes is a region that contains cytoplasmic determinants necessary for the development of the dorsal structures of the embryo. If the first cleavage plane is manipulated so that the gray crescent is contained in only one of the two blastomeres, then only that blastomere will have the necessary determinants for dorsal development. Therefore, only the blastomere with the gray crescent will be able to form a complete embryo. The size of the embryo will be smaller because it is formed from a single blastomere instead of the usual two.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
