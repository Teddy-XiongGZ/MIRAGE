    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Consanguinity, or the marriage between close relatives, increases the chance of offspring inheriting the same allele from both parents.

Therefore, consanguinity is strongly associated with autosomal recessive inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Autosomal recessive\"}"
