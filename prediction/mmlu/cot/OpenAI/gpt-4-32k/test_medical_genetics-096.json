    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High blood ammonia levels are typically associated with conditions that affect the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the body. Galactosaemia is a condition that affects the body's ability to process a simple sugar called galactose, but it does not directly involve ammonia metabolism. Hurler's syndrome is a type of mucopolysaccharidosis characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L iduronidase, not related to ammonia metabolism. Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder that results from the deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to a buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine, not ammonia. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, on the other hand, is a urea cycle disorder. OTC is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the body. A deficiency in this enzyme can lead to a buildup of ammonia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency.\"}"
