    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first stimulation caused a sharp rise in membrane potential, which is characteristic of depolarization. The lack of response to the second stimulation suggests that the neurons were in a refractory period, during which they are unable to respond to further stimulation. However, when the voltage of the second shock was increased, a response was observed, indicating that the neurons were able to be stimulated again. This suggests that the second shock occurred during the relative refractory period, during which a stronger than normal stimulus can cause depolarization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Depolarization\"}"
