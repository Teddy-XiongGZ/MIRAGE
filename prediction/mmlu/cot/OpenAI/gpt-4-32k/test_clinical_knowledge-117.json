    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. During this process, hydrogen ions (H+) are produced, which can lower the pH of the cell. An intracellular buffer is needed to limit these pH changes. Glutamine is an amino acid and does not have buffering capacity. Glucose is the substrate for glycolysis and does not act as a buffer. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars and does not have buffering capacity. Carnosine, however, is a dipeptide molecule that can act as a pH buffer within muscle cells, helping to maintain the acid-base balance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Carnosine\"}"
