    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Translation is the process of protein synthesis where the genetic information is transferred from mRNA to the protein. This process requires mRNA, which carries the genetic information from the DNA, tRNA, which brings the amino acids to the ribosome, and ribosomes, which are the sites of protein synthesis. RNA polymerase is involved in transcription, not translation. DNA and chromatin are not directly involved in the translation process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
