    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts. They speed up chemical reactions in a cell. They are affected by several factors. Temperature can affect the rate at which enzymes work. Too high or too low temperatures can denature the enzyme, making it inactive. pH can also affect enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal pH at which it can perform its function most efficiently. The presence of certain metal ions can also affect enzyme activity. Some enzymes require these ions for their activity, while others can be inhibited by them. Therefore, all of the factors listed can affect enzyme activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
