    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A Robertsonian translocation is a specific kind of chromosomal rearrangement that occurs when the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes fuse at the centromere to form a single chromosome. Therefore, the fusion does not occur at the telomeres, which are the ends of a chromosome, nor at the histones, which are proteins that DNA wraps around. The fusion also does not occur at the ends of the long arms, but rather at the centromere.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. centromeres.\"}"
