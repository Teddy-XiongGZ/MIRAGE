    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to convert the velocity from km/h to m/s. We know that 1 km/h is approximately 0.27778 m/s. So, 130 km/h is approximately 36.11 m/s. We can use the formula v^2 = u^2 + 2as to find the acceleration, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the distance. The car starts from rest, so u is 0. Substituting the values into the formula, we get (36.11 m/s)^2 = 2*a*50m. Solving for a, we get a = 13.08 m/s^2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
