    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. During this process, 4 ATP molecules are produced, but 2 ATP are used, so the net production is 2 ATP from glucose. Glycogen, on the other hand, is a stored form of glucose. When glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate, it bypasses the step in glycolysis that consumes an ATP. Therefore, the net production of ATP from glycogen is 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
