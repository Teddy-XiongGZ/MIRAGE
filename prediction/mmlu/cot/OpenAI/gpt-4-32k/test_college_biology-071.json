    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the method of intercellular communication that allows a molecule of 1,000 daltons to pass from one cell to another. Spot desmosomes and belt desmosomes are types of cell junctions that provide mechanical strength and do not allow for the passage of molecules between cells. Tight junctions also do not allow for the passage of molecules between cells. Gap junctions, however, are specialized intercellular connections that allow for the direct passage of ions and small molecules between cells. Therefore, a fluorescent molecule of 1,000 daltons would most likely pass from one cell to another through a gap junction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. gap junction\"}"
