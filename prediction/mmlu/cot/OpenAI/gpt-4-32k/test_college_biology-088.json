    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments. Oxygen is a byproduct of this process. The process of photosynthesis primarily occurs in the chloroplasts within the mesophyll cells of the leaf. Among the given options, the palisade mesophyll is the layer of cells in the leaves where most photosynthesis occurs due to its high chloroplast concentration. The cortex, epidermis, and vascular cambium do not have as many chloroplasts and therefore do not contribute as much to photosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Palisade mesophyll\"}"
