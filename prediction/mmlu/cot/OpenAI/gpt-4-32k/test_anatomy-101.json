    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lateral pterygoid muscle is a muscle of mastication, and it has two heads. The superior head attaches to the infratemporal surface and infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The inferior head attaches to the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate. The muscle inserts into the neck of the mandible and the articular disc and capsule of the temporomandibular joint. Its function is to protrude the mandible, which means to move it forward, and it also helps in the lowering of the mandible. Therefore, it does not elevate the mandible. The condylar process is a part of the mandible to which the lateral pterygoid muscle is attached.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
