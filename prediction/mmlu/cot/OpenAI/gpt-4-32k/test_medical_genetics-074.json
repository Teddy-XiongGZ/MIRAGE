    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adenoviruses are often used in gene therapy because they can carry a relatively large amount of foreign DNA into host cells. However, they do not integrate into the host genome, which means they do not provide long term expression (option A is incorrect). Because they do not integrate into the host genome, they have a low risk of insertional mutagenesis (option B is correct). Adenoviruses are highly immunogenic, which can lead to an immune response and limit their effectiveness (option C is incorrect). As for easy assembly, while adenoviruses are relatively easy to manipulate in the lab, this is not typically considered a major advantage in the context of gene therapy (option D is incorrect).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
