    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the part of the chromosome that attaches to the mitotic spindle during cell division. The chromatophore is related to color in cells, so it's not the correct answer. The chromomere is a bead-like structure in the chromosome, but it's not the site of attachment for the spindle. The centriole is involved in cell division, but it's not the part of the chromosome that attaches to the spindle. The kinetochore is a protein structure on chromatids where the spindle fibers attach during cell division, so it's the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. kinetochore\"}"
