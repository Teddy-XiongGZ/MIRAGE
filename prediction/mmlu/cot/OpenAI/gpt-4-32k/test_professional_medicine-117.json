    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relative risk ratio is a measure of the strength of the association between a risk factor (in this case, regular exercise) and an outcome (hip fractures). A relative risk of 1.0 means there is no association between the risk factor and the outcome. A relative risk greater than 1.0 indicates an increased risk of the outcome with the risk factor, while a relative risk less than 1.0 indicates a decreased risk. In this case, the relative risk of 1.2 suggests an increased risk of hip fractures among those who exercise regularly. The 95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8 does not include 1.0, which means the finding is statistically significant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Statistically significant overall increase in risk\"}"
