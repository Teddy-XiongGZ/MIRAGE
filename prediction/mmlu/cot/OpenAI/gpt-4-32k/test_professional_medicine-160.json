    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain that is relieved with defecation, and no abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory studies suggest a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. The pain is often relieved with defecation. The absence of nocturnal symptoms is also suggestive of IBS. Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), are often used in the treatment of IBS. Nefazodone is an antidepressant, but it's not commonly used due to its potential to cause liver failure. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which is not typically used in IBS. Nortriptyline is a TCA and Sertraline is an SSRI. Between these two, Sertraline is generally preferred due to its better side effect profile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sertraline\"}"
