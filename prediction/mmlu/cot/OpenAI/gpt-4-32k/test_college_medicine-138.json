    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myeloid progenitor cells are a type of stem cell that can differentiate into several types of blood cells. NK cells and T cells are lymphoid cells, not myeloid, so they are not derived from myeloid progenitor cells. Lymphoid progenitors are also not derived from myeloid progenitors, they are a separate lineage. Platelets, however, are derived from megakaryocytes, which are a type of cell that myeloid progenitors can differentiate into.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Platelet\"}"
