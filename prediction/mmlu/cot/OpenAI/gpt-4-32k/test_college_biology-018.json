    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A retrotransposon is a type of transposable element that can 'jump' from one location in the genome to another. It does this by first being transcribed into RNA, then using reverse transcriptase to convert the RNA back into DNA, which can then be inserted at a new location in the genome. Therefore, it replicates via an RNA intermediate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
