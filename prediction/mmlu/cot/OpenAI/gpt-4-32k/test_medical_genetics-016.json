    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This is a question about Mendelian genetics. The frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of getting AA, BB, and CC. The probability of getting AA from Aa and Aa is 1/4 (one AA, two Aa, and one aa). The same applies to BB and CC. Therefore, the overall probability is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/64.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
