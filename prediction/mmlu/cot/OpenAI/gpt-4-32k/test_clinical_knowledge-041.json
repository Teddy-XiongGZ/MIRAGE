    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A. This statement is true. Phosphofructokinase is indeed the rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis. B. This statement is also true. Type II fibers are fast twitch fibers, which rely more on glycolysis, and thus would have higher phosphorylase activity. C. This statement is true as well. Endurance training does increase the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle, as it increases the muscle's capacity for aerobic metabolism. D. This statement is false. Oxygen is not consumed in the TCA cycle. It is consumed in the electron transport chain, which is the final stage of cellular respiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
