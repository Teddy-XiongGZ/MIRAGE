    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype by altering the sequence of nucleotides in a gene. This can lead to the production of a different polypeptide during translation, which can then result in a new phenotype. The other options do not directly relate to how mutations in DNA can lead to a new phenotype. The polarity of tRNA does not change due to DNA mutations. Methylation of nucleic acids is a form of epigenetic regulation and does not involve changes in the DNA sequence. The direction in which a gene is read does not change due to mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
