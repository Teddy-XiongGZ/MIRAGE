    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a sound wave travels from one medium to another, its speed and wavelength change due to the change in the medium's density. However, the frequency of the sound wave remains constant because it is only dependent on the source of the sound, not the medium it travels through. The intensity of the sound can also change due to absorption or reflection by the new medium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. frequency\"}"
