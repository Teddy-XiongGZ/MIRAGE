    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cancer cells and normal cells grown in culture do have some similarities. However, cancer cells divide an indefinite number of times, which is not a characteristic of normal cells. Normal cells display contact inhibition, meaning they stop dividing when they come into contact with each other, while cancer cells do not. Normal cells and cancer cells both require a surface for attachment in order to grow. Lastly, cancer cells proliferate to a higher cell density than normal cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
