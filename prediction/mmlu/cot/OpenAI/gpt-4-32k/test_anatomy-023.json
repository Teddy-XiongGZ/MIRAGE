    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gastrulation is a phase early in the embryonic development of most animals, during which the single-layered blastula is reorganized into a multilayered structure known as the gastrula. This process forms the three primary germ layers of the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Therefore, it involves mesoderm formation. Neurulation, the process by which the neural plate becomes the neural tube, occurs after gastrulation. So, gastrulation occurs before neurulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. mesoderm formation and occurs before neurulation.\"}"
