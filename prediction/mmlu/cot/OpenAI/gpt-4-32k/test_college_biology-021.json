    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Natality refers to the birth rate, while mortality refers to the death rate. When these two rates are equal, it means that the number of births is equal to the number of deaths, so the population is not growing or decreasing. This is not a population crash, which would mean a sudden decrease in population. It's also not a population explosion, which would mean a sudden increase. Exponential growth refers to a growth rate that becomes ever more rapid in proportion to the growing total number or size. Therefore, the correct term for this situation is zero population growth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
