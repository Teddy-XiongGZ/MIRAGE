    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is an anaerobic process, meaning it does not require oxygen. The conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA, also known as beta-oxidation, does not directly use oxygen. The tricarboxylic acid cycle, also known as the Krebs' cycle or citric acid cycle, is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy, but it does not directly use oxygen. Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, which also does not require oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
