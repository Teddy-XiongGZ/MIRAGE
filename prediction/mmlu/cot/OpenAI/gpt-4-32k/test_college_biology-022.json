    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Homologous structures are those that have a similar structure but may have different functions, such as the arm of a human and the wing of a bat. Vestigial structures are those that have no apparent function and appear to be residual parts from a past ancestor. Analogous structures are those that have similar function but are not derived from a common ancestor. The wings of a bat and a butterfly both serve the same function, which is flight, but they are not derived from a common ancestor. Therefore, they are not homologous but analogous. They are not vestigial because they have a clear function. They are not dissimilar in form and function because they both serve the function of flight, even though their forms are different.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. analogous structures\"}"
