    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's vital signs indicate shock, likely due to hemorrhage from the gunshot wound. The decreased breath sounds on the left side suggest a hemothorax or pneumothorax. The entrance and exit wounds suggest that the bullet traversed the thoracic cavity. A CT scan would take too much time in this critical situation. Intubation and mechanical ventilation might be necessary later, but it's not the immediate next step. Peritoneal lavage could help identify intra-abdominal bleeding, but it doesn't address the thoracic injury. The most appropriate next step is a tube thoracostomy, which would drain the blood or air from the thoracic cavity and help restore the patient's blood pressure and oxygenation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Left tube thoracostomy\"}"
