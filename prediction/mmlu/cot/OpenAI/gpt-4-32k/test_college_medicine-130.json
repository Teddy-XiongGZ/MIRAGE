    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SDS-PAGE is a technique used to separate proteins based on their molecular weight. The SDS in SDS-PAGE stands for Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate, which is a detergent. This detergent is used to denature the proteins, meaning it breaks down the tertiary and secondary structure of the proteins, leaving only the primary structure. This allows the proteins to be linearized and uniformly negatively charged, which allows them to be separated based on their size or length of the primary sequence. Therefore, the SDS does not coat the proteins with a positive charge, it does not prevent the protein from denaturing, and it does not generate linear fragments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
