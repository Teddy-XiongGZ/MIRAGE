    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism that maintains serum glucose concentration in a fasting state. Option A is incorrect because gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal would not last for 12 hours. Option B is incorrect because skeletal muscle does not release glucose into the bloodstream. Option D is incorrect because leptin is involved in appetite regulation, not glucose homeostasis. Therefore, the most likely mechanism is glycogenolysis in the liver, which is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose to maintain blood glucose levels during fasting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Glycogenolysis in the liver\"}"
