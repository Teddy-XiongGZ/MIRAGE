    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The auscultatory gap is a period during which Korotkoff sounds indicating blood flow may disappear during auscultation of a blood pressure reading. This typically occurs between the first and second Korotkoff sounds. Therefore, it's not about the sounds disappearing when the bladder is equal with the diastolic pressure, or the sounds being heard between systolic and diastolic phases, or the sounds not disappearing when the cuff is fully deflated. It's about the sounds disappearing and then returning during the deflation process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
