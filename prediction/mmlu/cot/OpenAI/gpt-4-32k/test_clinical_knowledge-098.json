    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ATP is the primary source of energy for muscle contraction. However, the ATP store in muscle is limited and can only supply energy for a short period of high intensity exercise. It's definitely more than 2 milliseconds, which is too short. 2 seconds is also quite short for high intensity exercise. Between 10 and 20 seconds, 10 seconds is more accurate as the ATP store in muscle can supply energy for about 10 seconds before it needs to be replenished.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
