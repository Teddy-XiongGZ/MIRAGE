    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been taking enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, for the past 3 months. ACE inhibitors are known to cause a persistent, dry cough in some patients. This is due to the inhibition of the enzyme that breaks down bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. When bradykinin is not broken down, it accumulates and can cause a cough. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough is increased serum bradykinin concentrations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\"}"
