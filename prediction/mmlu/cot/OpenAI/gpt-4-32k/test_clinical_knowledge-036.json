    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Collagen fibers are a crucial part of the wound healing process. They are not re-established in the first five days of wound healing, as this is the inflammatory phase of healing where the wound is cleaned out and prepared for healing. Collagen fibers do provide a bridge across the surface of a wound, but this is a simplification of their role. They actually provide a framework for new tissue to grow. They do take some time to re-establish, as the production of collagen is a complex process that requires several days to weeks. Finally, collagen fibers are needed in all types of wound healing, including primary intention healing, which is the healing of a wound that is clean and has minimal tissue loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
