    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a marine ecosystem region where solar radiation can penetrate and there is an upwelling of nutrients. The bathyl zone is deep and doesn't receive sunlight. The benthyl zone is the bottom of a body of water, and also doesn't receive sunlight. The pelagic zone is the open ocean and while it does receive sunlight, it's not known for nutrient upwelling. The neritic zone, however, is the area of the ocean that extends from the low tide mark to the edge of the continental shelf. It is shallow enough to receive plenty of sunlight and is also known for nutrient upwelling due to its proximity to the shore.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. neritic zone\"}"
