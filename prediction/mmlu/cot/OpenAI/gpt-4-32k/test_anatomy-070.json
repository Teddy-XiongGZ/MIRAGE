    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proprioception is the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement. The Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) is no exception and has proprioceptive receptors. These receptors are primarily located in the capsule and ligaments of the TMJ. The lateral pterygoid muscle is also involved in the movement and stabilization of the TMJ, so it would also have proprioceptive receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. the capsule and ligaments of the TMJ and the lateral pterygoid muscle.\"}"
