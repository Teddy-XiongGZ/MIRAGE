    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The work of breathing refers to the effort required to expand and contract the lungs. A rise in respiratory rate (option A) would increase the work of breathing because the lungs have to expand and contract more frequently. Noisy breathing (option B) could be a sign of an obstruction or difficulty in the airways, which would also increase the work of breathing. An increase in the use of accessory muscles (option C) is a sign that the body is working harder to breathe. A respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (option D) is considered normal for an adult at rest, and would not necessarily indicate an increase in the work of breathing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
