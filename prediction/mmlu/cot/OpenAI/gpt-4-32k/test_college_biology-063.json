    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The protein is transcribed in the nucleus and synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. From there, it must cross the following membranes to reach the thylakoid lumen: 1) the outer membrane of the chloroplast, 2) the inner membrane of the chloroplast, and 3) the thylakoid membrane. Therefore, the protein must cross three membrane bilayers to reach its final location.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Three\"}"
