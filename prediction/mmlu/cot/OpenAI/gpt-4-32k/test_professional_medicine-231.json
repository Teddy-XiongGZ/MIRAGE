    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of intravenous drug use and the presence of a systolic heart murmur suggest infective endocarditis, a common complication in intravenous drug users. Infective endocarditis often affects the tricuspid valve in these patients, leading to tricuspid regurgitation. This condition is characterized by a holosystolic murmur that increases in intensity with inspiration (known as Carvallo's sign), as the increased venous return during inspiration leads to increased blood flow across the tricuspid valve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
