    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria uses the energy from the electrons carried by FADH2 and NADH+H to rephosphorylate ADP into ATP. Each NADH molecule can generate approximately 3 ATP molecules, while each FADH2 molecule can generate approximately 2 ATP molecules. Therefore, a pair of electrons carried in the form of one NADH and one FADH2 molecule can collectively rephosphorylate about 5 ATP molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 5 ATP.\"}"
