    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The amount of energy released when a substance is completely oxidised in the body is determined by its caloric content. The caloric content of each substance is as follows: glucose has 4 calories per gram, alcohol has 7 calories per gram, leucine (an amino acid) has 4 calories per gram, and palmitic acid (a type of fat) has 9 calories per gram. Therefore, palmitic acid releases the most energy when completely oxidised.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
