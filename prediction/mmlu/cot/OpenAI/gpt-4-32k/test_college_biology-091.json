    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phalloidin is a toxin that binds to actin subunits. Actin is a protein that forms microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Therefore, the structures that would be most directly affected by phalloidin would be those composed of actin, which are microfilaments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Microfilaments\"}"
