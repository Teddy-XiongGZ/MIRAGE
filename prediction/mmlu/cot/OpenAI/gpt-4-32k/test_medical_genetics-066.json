    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Population carrier screening is typically used for disorders that are autosomal recessive, meaning both parents must be carriers of the disorder for a child to be affected. Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and Tay-Sachs disease are all autosomal recessive disorders, making them suitable for population carrier screening. On the other hand, oculocutaneous albinism is not solely an autosomal recessive disorder. There are different types of this condition, some of which are autosomal recessive, but others are autosomal dominant or X-linked. This makes it less suitable for population carrier screening.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Oculocutaneous albinism\"}"
