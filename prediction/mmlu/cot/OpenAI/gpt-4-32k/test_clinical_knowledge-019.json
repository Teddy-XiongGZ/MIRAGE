Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is not an upper motor neurone lesion, it is a complication of shingles which is caused by the same virus as chickenpox. It is characterized by pain and a rash around the ear, in the mouth, face, neck, and scalp, and can cause facial paralysis. An inability to close the eyelid on the paralyzed side does indicate a lower motor neurone lesion, as the facial nerve is a lower motor neuron and its damage can lead to inability to close the eye on the affected side. In Bell's Palsy, the sense of taste can be affected because the facial nerve, which is affected in Bell's palsy, carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
