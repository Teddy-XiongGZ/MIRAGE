    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi apparatus is an organelle in eukaryotic cells that is involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins for secretion. It is composed of a series of flattened, stacked pouches called cisternae. The 'cis' face of the Golgi apparatus is the side closest to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where proteins are synthesized and enter the Golgi apparatus. The 'trans' face is the side where modified proteins exit the Golgi apparatus. The cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are not continuous with one another, but are separate entities. Glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules to proteins, is a modification that occurs within the Golgi apparatus, not prior to a protein's entry into it. Therefore, the statement that the Golgi apparatus is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
