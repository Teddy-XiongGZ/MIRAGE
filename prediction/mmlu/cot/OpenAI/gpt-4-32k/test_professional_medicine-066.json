    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of sandblasting and smoking, along with his symptoms and physical examination findings, suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and silicosis. Silicosis is a form of pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust, and is characterized by symptoms of cough and dyspnea, as well as findings of upper lobe nodular opacities and eggshell calcification of the hilar lymph nodes on imaging. In this case, the patient's severe hypoxemia (oxygen saturation of 70%) is a concerning finding that requires immediate intervention. Among the options provided, continuous humidified oxygen is the most appropriate intervention. This would help to increase his oxygen saturation levels, alleviate his symptoms, and prevent further complications. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive medication and is not indicated in this case. Bronchoscopy could be useful for diagnostic purposes, but it would not address the patient's immediate need for oxygen. Nocturnal CPAP is used in conditions like sleep apnea, but it would not provide the continuous oxygen supplementation that this patient needs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Continuous humidified oxygen\"}"
