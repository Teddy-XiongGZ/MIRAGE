    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle contraction and relaxation are controlled by the nervous system. When a nerve stimulus is sent to a muscle, it causes the muscle to contract. When the nerve stimulus is removed, the muscle relaxes. The forcefulness of the stimulus does not cause relaxation, it would rather cause a stronger contraction. The actin binding sites being uncovered or saturated are related to the process of muscle contraction, not relaxation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
