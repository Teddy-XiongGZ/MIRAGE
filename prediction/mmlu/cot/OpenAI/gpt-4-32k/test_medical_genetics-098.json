    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The differential distribution of substances in the egg, also known as cytoplasmic determinants, can influence the fate of the cells as the embryo develops. These substances can include proteins, mRNA, and other molecules that can affect gene expression. This can establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide. The other options, such as amplification of specific genes, development of polyploid tissues, or loss of specific genes, are not typically a direct result of the differential distribution of substances in the egg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
