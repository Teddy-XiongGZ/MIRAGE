    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is in active labor and has been having regular contractions, but they have now become weak and intermittent. There is no obstruction to labor, the fetal head is engaged, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. This suggests that the labor is not progressing as expected, which is known as labor dystocia. The most appropriate management in this case would be to augment the labor. An epidural anesthetic (choice A) is not indicated as the patient has already received pain medication. Tocolytic therapy (choice B) is used to stop preterm labor, not to augment it. Cervical topical corticosteroids (choice C) are used to mature the fetal lungs in cases of preterm labor, not to augment labor. Therefore, the best choice is to augment the labor with oxytocin (choice D), which will stimulate uterine contractions and help labor progress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
