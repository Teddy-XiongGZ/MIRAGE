    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. The rate limiting step of a metabolic pathway is the slowest step, and thus determines the overall rate of the entire process. In glycolysis, the rate limiting enzyme is the one that catalyzes the third step, which is the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. phosphofructokinase.\"}"
