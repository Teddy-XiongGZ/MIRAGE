    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of events that occur when the heart beats. It is divided into two main phases: systole and diastole. During systole, the heart muscles contract to pump blood out of the heart. During diastole, the heart muscles relax to allow the heart chambers to fill with blood. There is no phase called 'rest' in the cardiac cycle, and 'contraction' is essentially the same as 'systole'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. diastole and systole.\"}"
