    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium bicarbonate ingestion is known to improve athletic performance, particularly in middle distance running. This is because sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer in the body, helping to neutralize the acid produced during intense exercise. This acid, in the form of hydrogen ions, can interfere with the muscles' ability to contract, leading to fatigue. By elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, sodium bicarbonate allows for a faster efflux, or exit, of hydrogen ions from the muscle. This helps to delay the onset of fatigue and improve performance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
