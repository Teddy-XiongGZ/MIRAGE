    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A central painful stimulus is a type of stimulus that is applied to the body's core, or central region, to assess a patient's level of consciousness or responsiveness. Supra-orbital ridge pressure, trapezius squeeze, and sternal rub are all examples of central painful stimuli because they are applied to the body's core region. On the other hand, pressure on the little finger pulp is applied to the periphery of the body, not the core, so it is not considered a central painful stimulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
