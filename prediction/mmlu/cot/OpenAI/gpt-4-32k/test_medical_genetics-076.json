    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, but it's not a trinucleotide repeat expansion. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation in the DMD gene, but again, it's not a trinucleotide repeat expansion. Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, but it's not a trinucleotide repeat expansion. Huntington disease, however, is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
