    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the process of aerobic respiration cannot continue. This process includes the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, both of which require oxygen. Oxaloacetate is produced in the Krebs cycle, water is produced in the electron transport chain, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced in both. However, pyruvate is produced in glycolysis, which is an anaerobic process and does not require oxygen. Therefore, the production of pyruvate will not be affected by the lack of oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Adenosine triphosphate\"}"
