    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ADP, or adenosine diphosphate, is a molecule that plays a crucial role in energy transfer within cells. During high-intensity exercise such as multiple sprint sports, the body's demand for energy increases, leading to an increase in the breakdown of ADP. This process results in the production of various byproducts. Ammonia is one of these byproducts, produced as a result of protein and amino acid metabolism. Hypoxanthine is another byproduct, which is a part of the purine nucleotide cycle and is produced during the breakdown of ATP. Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism, which includes hypoxanthine. Therefore, during high-intensity exercise, the concentration of these byproducts in the blood would increase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\"}"
