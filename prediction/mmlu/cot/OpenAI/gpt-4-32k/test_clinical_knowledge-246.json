    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy during high-intensity exercise. When carbohydrate intake is low, the body may not have enough glycogen stores to support high-intensity exercise, which could impair performance. Resting muscle pH is not directly affected by carbohydrate intake. The body does not rely more on muscle glycogen during exercise when carbohydrate intake is low; instead, it may turn to other energy sources like fat. Exercise performance in events lasting less than 10 minutes may not be significantly affected by low carbohydrate intake because the body can use stored glycogen for short-term energy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
