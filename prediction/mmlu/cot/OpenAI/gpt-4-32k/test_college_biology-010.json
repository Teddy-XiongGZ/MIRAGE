    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cleavage symmetry refers to the pattern of cell division during early embryonic development. Meroblastic cleavage is a type of incomplete division that occurs in eggs with a large amount of yolk, so it's not the correct answer. Radial cleavage is a type of cleavage pattern where the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis, so it's not the correct answer either. Superficial cleavage occurs when the cell divisions are restricted to the outer layer of the egg, so it's not the correct answer. Spiral cleavage is a type of cleavage pattern where the spindle axes are at an oblique angle to the polar axis, which matches the description in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
