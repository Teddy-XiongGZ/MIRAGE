    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, generalized aching, and proximal muscle weakness, along with elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, are suggestive of a muscle disorder. Fibromyalgia typically presents with widespread pain and tenderness but does not cause muscle weakness or elevated muscle enzymes. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with use and improves with rest, but it does not typically cause muscle pain or elevated muscle enzymes. Scleroderma can cause skin changes and muscle weakness, but it is typically associated with other systemic symptoms and specific skin findings, which are not described here. Polymyositis, on the other hand, is characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes, which matches the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Polymyositis\"}"
