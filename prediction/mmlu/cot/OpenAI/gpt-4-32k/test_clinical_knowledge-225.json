    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that causes numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hand. It happens because of pressure on your median nerve, which runs the length of your arm, goes through a passage in your wrist called the carpal tunnel, and ends in your hand. Therefore, option B is incorrect as it mentions the ulna nerve, not the median nerve. Option C is also incorrect because the carpal tunnel syndrome affects the lateral three and a half digits, not the medial. Option D is incorrect as well because the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, including paraesthesia, are often worse at night. However, option A is correct. Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation and swelling that compresses the median nerve, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
