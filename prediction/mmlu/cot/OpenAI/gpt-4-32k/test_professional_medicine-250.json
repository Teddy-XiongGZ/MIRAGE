    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is in severe pain due to multiple injuries and surgeries. She is receiving morphine, a potent opioid analgesic, via a patient-controlled pump. This method of administration allows the patient to control her pain relief, which is important in postoperative pain management. The patient's concern about addiction is understandable but unfounded. Addiction is a complex condition characterized by compulsive drug use despite harmful consequences. It is unlikely to develop in a patient who is using opioids for a short period under medical supervision for acute pain. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose, not to prevent addiction. Switching to oral acetaminophen or intramuscular lorazepam would not provide adequate pain relief for this patient's level of pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
