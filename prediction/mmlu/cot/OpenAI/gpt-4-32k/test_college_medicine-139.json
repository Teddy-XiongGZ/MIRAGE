    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactate and hydrogen ions are byproducts of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle. They need to be removed from the muscle to prevent acidosis. They do not leave the muscle via a cotransport mechanism with carnosine, as carnosine is a dipeptide of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine, and it's involved in buffering the pH in muscle cells, not in transporting lactate or hydrogen ions. They also do not leave via an active transport mechanism, as active transport requires energy and is used for substances that need to be moved against a concentration gradient. They do not leave via a protein transporter molecule either, as these are typically used for larger molecules. Instead, lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle by simple diffusion, which is a passive process where substances move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
