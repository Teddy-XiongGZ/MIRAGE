    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels, specifically very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in the blood. This is not due to the diet but due to the mutation in genes. The gene that is commonly affected in familial hypercholesterolemia is the one that codes for the LDL receptor. This receptor is responsible for removing LDL from the bloodstream. When these receptors are not functioning properly due to a genetic mutation, LDL levels in the blood can become extremely high.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Low density lipoprotein receptor\"}"
