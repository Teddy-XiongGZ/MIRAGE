    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exons are sequences of DNA that are transcribed into mRNA and then translated into protein. A. Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA. This is incorrect because exons are coding sequences. B. The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site. This is not always the case, as the start codon can be located in other exons. C. The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon. This is generally true, but there can be exceptions. D. A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames. This is incorrect because the reading frame is determined by the start codon, not the exon itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
