    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sprinting is a high-intensity exercise that primarily uses anaerobic metabolism for energy production. As the number of sprints increases, the body continues to rely on anaerobic metabolism, which leads to the production of lactic acid. This can cause a decrease in muscle pH, but it is unlikely to fall below 6.0 as the body has mechanisms to buffer the pH. Blood glucose concentration may decrease with prolonged exercise, but it is unlikely to fall below 3 mmol/L as the body has mechanisms to maintain blood glucose levels. The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism does not increase with an increasing number of sprints because sprinting is primarily an anaerobic activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
