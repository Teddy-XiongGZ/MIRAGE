    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Influenza is an RNA virus, not a DNA virus, so it does not incorporate viral DNA into the host cell\u2019s chromosome, which eliminates option A. It also does not destroy the host cell\u2019s transcriptional machinery, so option B is incorrect. Influenza does not use a viral copy of reverse transcriptase to manufacture viral DNA, as this is a characteristic of retroviruses, not influenza, so option D is incorrect. The correct answer is that the influenza virus replicates its genetic material and synthesizes viral proteins, which is how it propagates itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
