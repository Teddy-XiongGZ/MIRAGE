    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fatigue in high intensity exercise is not related to a fall in the cell concentration of ADP, as ADP is actually a product of ATP breakdown and would increase, not decrease, during high intensity exercise. It's also not related to lack of skill. While skill can affect performance, it doesn't directly cause fatigue. The two plausible options are B and C. Inhibition of ATP production and failure of the ATP supply to match the demand are similar, but the latter is more accurate. ATP is the main source of energy for muscle contraction. During high intensity exercise, the demand for ATP increases. If the supply can't keep up with the demand, fatigue sets in.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
