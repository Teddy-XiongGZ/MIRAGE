    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osmotic shock occurs when a cell is suddenly exposed to a change in the solute concentration of its surrounding environment, causing water to move across the cell membrane. If the interior of the pollen grains released starch granules due to osmotic shock, it means that the interior of the pollen grains had a higher concentration of solutes (was hypertonic) compared to the surrounding environment. This would cause water to rush into the pollen grains, leading to their rupture and the release of the starch granules. Therefore, the pollen grains did not undergo plasmolysis (which is the shrinking of the cell due to loss of water) or shrinking before they ruptured. Instead, they likely swelled due to the influx of water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\"}"
