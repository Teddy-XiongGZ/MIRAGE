    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cell motility is the ability of a cell to move. It involves several components. Adhesion plaques are involved in cell motility as they help the cell to attach to the extracellular matrix. Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions, where it is thought to function as one of several interacting proteins involved in anchoring F-actin to the membrane. Lamellipodia are cellular protrusions that play a key role in cell migration. Clathrin, on the other hand, is a protein that plays a major role in the formation of coated vesicles. It is not directly involved in cell motility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. clathrin\"}"
