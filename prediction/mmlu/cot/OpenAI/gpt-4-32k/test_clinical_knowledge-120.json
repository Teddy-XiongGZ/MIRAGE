    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Haematuria is a symptom, not a cause of urinary retention. Drinking alcohol can lead to increased urine production, but it does not cause urinary retention. Kidney stones can cause pain and other symptoms, but they typically do not cause acute urinary retention unless they are blocking the ureter, which is relatively rare. Bladder outflow obstruction, on the other hand, can directly lead to urinary retention as it prevents the bladder from emptying properly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
