    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic disorder. It is not autosomal, meaning it is not inherited from the non-sex chromosomes. Instead, it is a sex-linked trait, specifically linked to the X chromosome. The disease is more common in males because they have only one X chromosome, so a single recessive gene on that X chromosome will cause the disease. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so a recessive gene on one of them may not cause the disease if the corresponding gene on the other chromosome is normal. Therefore, the pattern of inheritance for G6PD deficiency is X-linked recessive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. X-linked recessive.\"}"
