    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include confusion, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, muscle rigidity, and psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy. These symptoms, along with the elevated leukocyte count and serum creatine kinase activity, suggest a systemic response to a severe condition. The patient's recent psychiatric history and the initiation of an unknown medication are important clues. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a life-threatening condition that can occur in response to antipsychotic medications, which the patient may have been prescribed for his auditory hallucinations. It is characterized by fever, altered mental status, autonomic instability, and generalized muscle rigidity (lead pipe rigidity), which are all present in this patient. The other options do not fit as well with the patient's presentation. Amphetamine intoxication could cause some of these symptoms, but not the muscle rigidity. Bacterial meningitis would typically present with a stiff neck, which this patient does not have. Delirium tremens is associated with alcohol withdrawal, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\"}"
