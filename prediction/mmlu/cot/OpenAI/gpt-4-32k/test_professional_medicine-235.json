Therefore, the abscesses must be physically drained to allow for resolution of the infection. Psychiatric consultation is important for this patient given his history of self-mutilation, but it is not the immediate next step in management.

Transfer to a burn center is not necessary as the burns are not extensive, life-threatening, or involving the face, hands, feet, or perineum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Incision and drainage\"}"
