    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osmosis is the process of movement of solvent from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration through a semi-permeable membrane. Passive transport is the movement of substances across the membrane without the use of energy, and it includes processes like diffusion and osmosis. Active transport, on the other hand, requires energy to move substances against their concentration gradient. Endocytosis is a process where the cell engulfs some material from outside into a vesicle. Among these, the process that uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane is passive transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
