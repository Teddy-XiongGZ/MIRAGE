    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Net primary productivity refers to the rate at which plants and other photosynthetic organisms produce organic compounds in an ecosystem. This process is highly dependent on environmental conditions such as temperature and availability of water. The tropics are characterized by warm temperatures and high rainfall, which are ideal conditions for photosynthesis. While species diversity and lower metabolic costs may contribute to plant growth, they are not the primary factors affecting net primary productivity. Predation does not directly affect plant photosynthesis and growth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
