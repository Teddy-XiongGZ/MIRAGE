    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate is a process known as glycolysis. In this process, there is a net gain of two ATP molecules. This is because four ATP molecules are produced, but two are used up in the initial steps of glycolysis. Therefore, the net gain is two ATP molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
