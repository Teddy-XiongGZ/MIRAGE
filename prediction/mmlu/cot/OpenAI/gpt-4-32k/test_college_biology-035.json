    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alternation of generations is a type of life cycle found in terrestrial plants and some algae in which subsequent generations of individuals alternate between haploid and diploid organisms. In ferns, the dominant phase is the sporophyte, which is diploid. The sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, which grow into the gametophyte. The gametophyte, which is haploid, then produces gametes by mitosis. The gametes fuse to form a zygote, which grows into a new sporophyte. Therefore, the sporophyte and gametophyte are not equal in life spans, and the gametophyte does not produce gametes by meiosis. The gametophyte is also not dominant and does not alternate with a dependent sporophyte.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
