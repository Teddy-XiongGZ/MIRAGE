    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endurance training is a type of physical training that improves stamina and endurance. It doesn't necessarily make muscles contract faster, so option A is incorrect. Phosphocreatine is a form of stored energy in the cells, and while it's true that endurance training can increase the body's efficiency in using this energy, the primary effect is not to break it down, so option B is also incorrect. Endurance training does not primarily increase the muscle's capacity to generate energy anaerobically, as it primarily improves aerobic metabolism, so option D is incorrect. The main effect of endurance training is to increase the muscle's capacity to burn fat and carbohydrates, which are the primary sources of energy during prolonged exercise. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
