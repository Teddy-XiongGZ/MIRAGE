    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A. This is true. Hyperpolarization is a mechanism that prevents the neuron from firing too rapidly by making the inside of the neuron more negative than its resting potential. B. This is also true. The first phase of an action potential is depolarization, which is caused by the rapid influx of sodium ions into the neuron. D. This is true as well. An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock, the part of the neuron where the axon originates, reaches the threshold potential. C. This is not true. Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals, not the dendrites.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
