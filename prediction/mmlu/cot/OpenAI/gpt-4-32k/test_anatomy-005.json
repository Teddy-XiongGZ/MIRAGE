    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The spinal cord is responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to the rest of the body. The cervical region of the spinal cord controls signals to the back of the head, neck and shoulders, arms and hands, and the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the primary muscle used in the process of inspiration, or breathing. When the spinal cord is damaged at the sixth cervical vertebra, it can affect the patient's ability to control their diaphragm and therefore their ability to breathe. However, it's not always the case that they will be completely unable to breathe without life support. The extent of the damage and the individual's overall health will also play a role.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. It is impossible to predict an effect on breathing.\"}"
