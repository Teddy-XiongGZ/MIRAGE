    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maximum sustainable power refers to the highest level of energy output that an athlete can maintain over a certain period of time. It is not usually constant during a race because as the race progresses, the athlete's energy reserves deplete, leading to a decline in power. A high fat diet does not necessarily improve maximum sustainable power, as it depends on the type of sport and the athlete's individual metabolism. Muscle glycogen is a form of energy storage for the body, so the more glycogen content, the more energy reserves an athlete has, meaning the maximum sustainable power would not be inversely related to muscle glycogen content.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
