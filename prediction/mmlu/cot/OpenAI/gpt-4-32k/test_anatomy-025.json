    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When we breathe in, we inhale a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen and oxygen, with small amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide and argon. When we exhale, we release gases from our body, the primary one being carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration. We do not exhale carbon monoxide in any significant quantity as it is a poisonous gas not normally present in the body. While we do exhale some nitrogen and oxygen, the amount of oxygen is less than what we inhaled because some of it is used by our body for various processes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Carbon dioxide\"}"
