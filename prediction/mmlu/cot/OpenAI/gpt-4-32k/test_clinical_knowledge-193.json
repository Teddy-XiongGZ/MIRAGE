The American Heart Association recommends that untrained bystanders and medical personnel alike begin CPR with chest compressions. It's far better to do something than to do nothing at all if you're fearful that your knowledge or abilities aren't 100 percent complete. The patient should be flat on a firm surface to allow for the most effective chest compressions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
