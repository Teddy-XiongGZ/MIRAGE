    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders if not treated. It's an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning both parents must pass on a defective gene for a child to be affected. However, if a mother with PKU is untreated during pregnancy, the high levels of phenylalanine in her blood can harm the developing fetus, even if the fetus doesn't have the PKU gene. This condition is known as maternal PKU, and the risk of abnormalities in the child is very high.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Almost 100%\"}"
