    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, clitoral enlargement, and increased serum testosterone concentration suggest virilization, which is the development of male secondary sexual characteristics in a female. This is often due to an androgen-secreting tumor. The normal serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids suggest that the source of the excess androgen is not the adrenal gland, but rather the ovaries. The presence of a large ovarian mass on ultrasonography further supports this. Among the options, the Sertoli-Leydig tumor, also known as an androblastoma, is a type of ovarian tumor that can secrete androgens, leading to virilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\"}"
