    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A tracheostomy tube is a medical device that is inserted into a hole in the patient's neck and trachea to help them breathe. The cuff on a tracheostomy tube is a small balloon at the end of the tube that can be inflated or deflated. It does not assist with swallowing or allow the patient to talk. It also does not reduce local oedema. The main purpose of the cuff is to create an air seal within the trachea, which helps to prevent aspiration of saliva or gastric contents into the lungs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
