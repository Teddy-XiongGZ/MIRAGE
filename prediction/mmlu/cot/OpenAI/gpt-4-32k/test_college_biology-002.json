    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The amnion is a membrane that closely covers the embryo when first formed. It fills with the amniotic fluid which causes the amnion to expand and become the amniotic sac which serves to provide a protective environment for the developing embryo or fetus. The fluid serves as a cushion for the growing fetus but also serves to facilitate the exchange of nutrients, water, and biochemical products between mother and fetus. Therefore, the amnion is responsible for secreting the fluid that encases the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates to prevent desiccation and injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. amnion\"}"
