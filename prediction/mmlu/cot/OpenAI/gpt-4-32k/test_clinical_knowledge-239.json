    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic metabolism refers to the metabolic process that occurs in the absence of oxygen. It involves the conversion of glucose into ATP, which is the main source of energy for cells. ADP is involved in this process as it is converted into ATP. Glycogen, a form of glucose storage in the body, can also be used in anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, the key characteristic of anaerobic metabolism is that it occurs without the use of oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. in the absence of available oxygen.\"}"
