    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's insomnia is characterized by early morning awakenings, which is a common complaint among the elderly. This is often due to a phase advance in the circadian rhythm that occurs with aging. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest any underlying medical or psychiatric conditions that could be causing his insomnia. Therefore, the first step in management should be nonpharmacologic measures to improve sleep hygiene. Alcohol can interfere with the sleep cycle and cause awakenings, so it would be beneficial for the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol.

Sertraline is an antidepressant and would not be appropriate for this patient as he has no history of depression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
