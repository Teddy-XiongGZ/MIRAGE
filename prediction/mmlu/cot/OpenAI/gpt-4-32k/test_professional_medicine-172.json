    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman has a single gene deletion, meaning she is a carrier for \u03b1-thalassemia. The man has a two-gene deletion, meaning he has \u03b1-thalassemia. If the two-gene deletion is in trans, it means that one deletion is on the maternal gene and one deletion is on the paternal gene. When they have offspring, there are four possible combinations: no deletion, one deletion from the mother, one deletion from the father, or one deletion from both. The chance of getting one deletion from both (which would result in a two-gene deletion) is 1 in 4, or 25%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 25%\"}"
