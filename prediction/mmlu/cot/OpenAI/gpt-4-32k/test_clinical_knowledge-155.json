    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hand is used for various functions, including sensory (touch, feel), motor (grip, grasp, pinch), and communication (sign language, gestures). The options A, B, and D all include some of these functions. However, option B includes 'percussion', which is not a primary function of the hand but rather a specific use in music. Option C includes 'tap', 'slap', and 'clap', which are more specific actions rather than primary uses. Therefore, the best answer would be D, which includes 'touch', 'pinch', and 'grasp', all primary uses of the hand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
