    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection is based on several key principles. These include the overproduction of offspring, which leads to competition for limited resources, and differential survival and reproductive success, where the fittest individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce. The inheritance of traits, both 'fit' and 'unfit', is also a part of this theory. However, Darwin's theory does not specifically mention the inheritance of both 'fit' and 'unfit' genes. It only states that traits that increase an individual's fitness are more likely to be passed on to the next generation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
