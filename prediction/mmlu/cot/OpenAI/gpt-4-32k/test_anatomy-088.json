    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The paranasal sinuses are air-filled extensions of the respiratory part of the nasal cavity. There are four pairs of sinuses: maxillary, frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid. The middle meatus is one of the three major outflow pathways of the sinuses. The anterior ethmoidal sinuses, frontal sinuses, and maxillary sinuses all drain into the middle meatus. The sphenoidal sinuses, however, drain into the sphenoethmoidal recess, not the middle meatus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. The anterior ethmoidal, frontal and maxillary sinuses\"}"
