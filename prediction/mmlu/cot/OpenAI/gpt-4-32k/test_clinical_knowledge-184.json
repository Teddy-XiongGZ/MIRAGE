    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms. It is not determined by the size of proteins in the cell (A) or the availability of amino acids (B). The amino acid composition of the ribonucleic acids (D) is also not a determinant of metabolism. However, the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material (C) play a crucial role in metabolism. These proteins include enzymes that catalyze various chemical reactions, transport proteins that move molecules across cell membranes, and many others that perform specific metabolic functions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
