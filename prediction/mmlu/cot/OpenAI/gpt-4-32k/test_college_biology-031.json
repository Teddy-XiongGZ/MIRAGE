    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Normal somatic cells of a human male are diploid, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. This includes 44 autosomes and two sex chromosomes, one X and one Y. Therefore, they do contain the entire genetic information possessed by the original zygote and a diploid nucleus. An inactivated X chromosome, also known as a Barr body, is typically found in female cells, not male cells. Females have two X chromosomes, one of which is inactivated to prevent double dosage of X-linked genes. Since males have only one X chromosome, there is no need for inactivation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
