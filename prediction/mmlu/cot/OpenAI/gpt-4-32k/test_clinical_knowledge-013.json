    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen, a storage form of glucose in the body, is broken down in a process called glycogenolysis. The first step of this process involves the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which cleaves \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic linkages in the glycogen molecule, releasing glucose-1-phosphate. Therefore, the initial product of glycogen breakdown in muscle is not glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, or glucose-1,6-diphosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. glucose-1-phosphate.\"}"
