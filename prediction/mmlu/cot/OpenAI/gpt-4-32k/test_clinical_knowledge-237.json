    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A surgical support is typically used to provide additional support to a weakened or damaged area. A prolapsed stoma is a condition where the stoma extends out further than normal, which could benefit from additional support. High output stomas are not necessarily in need of support, but rather careful management and monitoring. A herniation around the stoma is a condition where a part of an organ pushes through an opening in the muscles, which could also benefit from additional support. Retraction of the stoma is a condition where the stoma pulls inward, below the skin level, which could also benefit from additional support.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A, C, D\"}"
