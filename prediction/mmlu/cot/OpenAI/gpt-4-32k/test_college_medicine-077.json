    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sensory or neural adaptation refers to the process by which our sensory receptors become less responsive to constant stimuli. This means that when we are continuously exposed to a certain stimulus, our sensory receptors adapt and we no longer perceive the stimulus as strongly as we initially did. Looking at the options, A, B, C, and D all seem to describe situations where sensory adaptation could occur. However, option D is slightly different. The smell of formaldehyde in an anatomy lab is a chemical stimulus, and our olfactory system does not adapt to chemical stimuli in the same way as it does to other types of stimuli. Instead, we may become 'used' to the smell, but this is more a psychological process rather than a physiological adaptation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
