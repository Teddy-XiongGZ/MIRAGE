    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symplastic pathway involves the movement of substances from one cell to another through the cytoplasm, connected by plasmodesmata. The pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem would involve the following steps: 1. Sucrose is synthesized in the mesophyll cells during photosynthesis. 2. It then moves into the bundle sheath cells, which surround the vascular bundles. 3. From the bundle sheath cells, sucrose moves into the phloem parenchyma cells. 4. It then moves into the companion cells, which are closely associated with the sieve tube elements. 5. Finally, sucrose is loaded into the sieve tube elements of the phloem for long-distance transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
