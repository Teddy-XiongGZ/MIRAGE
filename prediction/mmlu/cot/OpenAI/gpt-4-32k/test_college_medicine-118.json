    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prosthetic groups are non-protein molecules that are tightly bound to enzymes. They are not required by all enzymes in the cell, so option A is incorrect. They are not loosely bound to enzymes via hydrogen bonds, so option B is incorrect. They are not sites on the enzyme molecule that permit allosteric modification of enzyme activity, so option C is incorrect. They are indeed tightly bound to enzymes and are required for their activity, which makes option D correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
