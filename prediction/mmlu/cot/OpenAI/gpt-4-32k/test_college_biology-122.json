    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mitochondria generate ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which relies on the creation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient is created by the pumping of protons (H+) from the matrix to the intermembrane space. When the external pH is low, this means there is a high concentration of H+ ions outside the mitochondria. This would not increase the concentration of OH- ions, so options A and B can be eliminated. It also wouldn't necessarily increase the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix, so option C can be eliminated. The high concentration of H+ ions outside the mitochondria would, however, increase the diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix, which would drive ATP synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
