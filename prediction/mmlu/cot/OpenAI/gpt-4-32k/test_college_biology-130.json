    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Xylem is a type of tissue in vascular plants that transports water and some nutrients from the roots to the leaves. The two types of cells that are primarily involved in this process are tracheids and vessel elements. Collenchyma and sclerenchyma are types of cells that provide support to the plant, but they do not conduct water and minerals. Sieve tube members and companion cells are part of the phloem, not the xylem, and they are involved in transporting sugars and other organic compounds, not water and minerals. Vessel elements do conduct water and minerals, but companion cells do not; they are part of the phloem.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. tracheids and vessel elements\"}"
