    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nekton refers to the group of aquatic animals that are able to swim and move independently of water currents. These include various species of fish and marine mammals. A whale is a marine mammal that can swim and move independently of water currents. On the other hand, a barnacle is a type of arthropod that is usually attached to hard surfaces of rocks and ships, hence it is not part of the nekton. Cyanobacteria and protists are microscopic organisms, they are not capable of active, directed movement and are usually part of the plankton, not the nekton.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
