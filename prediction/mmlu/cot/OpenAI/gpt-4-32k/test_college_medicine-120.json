    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During physical activity, such as a soccer game, the body's demand for energy increases. This energy is initially supplied by aerobic metabolism, but as the intensity of the activity increases, the body begins to rely more on anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactate as a byproduct. Therefore, as the game progresses and players become more fatigued, the blood lactate concentration would increase. It would not be lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half, and it could potentially increase above 3 mM depending on the intensity of the game.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.\"}"
