    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the role of ZP3 in the acrosomal reaction of sperm, which is crucial for fertilization. A, B, and C all involve blocking the interaction between ZP3 and its receptor, which would be expected to prevent fertilization. D, however, involves a different glycoprotein, ZP2. There's no information given that suggests ZP2 would have the same effect as ZP3, so we wouldn't necessarily expect it to cause sperm aggregation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
