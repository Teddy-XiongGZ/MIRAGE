    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Low-speed centrifugation is used to separate components of a solution based on their size and density. The larger and denser the component, the faster it will sediment during centrifugation. DNA and mRNA are both very small and would not be separated by low-speed centrifugation. The Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum are both large organelles and would also not be separated by low-speed centrifugation. Lysosomes and endosomes are similar in size and density, so they would not be separated by low-speed centrifugation. However, nuclei are larger and denser than secretory vesicles, so they would sediment faster and could be separated by low-speed centrifugation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
