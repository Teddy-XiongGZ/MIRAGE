    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that a young male bird, when reared in isolation and exposed only to the song of a different bird species, will develop an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This suggests that the bird's song is not entirely instinctive, as it is influenced by the songs it hears during development. Therefore, it's not entirely learned either, because the bird still retains some characteristics of its own species' song. This implies that the bird's song is a combination of both instinctive and learned behaviors. The question does not provide any information about the role of hormones in the development of the bird's song, so we cannot conclude that the song is dependent upon hormones for proper development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. both instinctive and learned\"}"
