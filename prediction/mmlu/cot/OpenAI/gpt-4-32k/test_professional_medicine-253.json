    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's age, the presence of fatigue, and the laboratory findings of leukocytosis with a predominance of mature-appearing lymphocytes suggest a chronic process. Acute leukemias typically present with symptoms of bone marrow failure (eg, fatigue, infection, bleeding) and are associated with blasts on peripheral smear. The immunohistochemical stains showing the lymphocytes to be of B-cell origin further narrow the diagnosis to a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Among the answer choices, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a mature B-cell neoplasm that typically presents in older adults. Therefore, CLL is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. chronic lymphocytic leukemia\"}"
