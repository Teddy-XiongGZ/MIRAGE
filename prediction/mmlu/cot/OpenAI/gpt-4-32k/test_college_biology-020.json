    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body. They do not raise the temperature of the reaction mixture, so option A is incorrect. They also do not alter the equilibrium constant of a reaction, so option B is incorrect. While they do increase the maximal rate of the chemical reaction, this is not the primary reason they facilitate reactions, so option C is not the best answer. Enzymes work primarily by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur, which speeds up the conversion of reactants to products.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
