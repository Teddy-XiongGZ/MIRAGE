    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first point of entry of water in the roots of a plant is through the root hairs, which are extensions of the epidermal cells. The water then moves through the cortex, which is made up of parenchyma cells, towards the center of the root. The endodermis is the innermost layer of the cortex, and it contains the Casparian strip, which is a band of suberin that prevents water from passing between the cells. Therefore, water must enter the cells of the endodermis to continue its journey towards the xylem. The root cap, pericycle, and Casparian strip are not the first points of entry for water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. endoderm\"}"
