    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During high-intensity, short-duration activities like sprinting, the body primarily uses fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are also known as Type II fibers. These fibers are further divided into Type IIa and Type IIX. Type IIa fibers are fast oxidative fibers, which have a moderate resistance to fatigue. On the other hand, Type IIX fibers are fast glycolytic fibers, which fatigue very quickly. Therefore, in all-out exercise such as sprinting, the first fiber types to fatigue would be the Type IIX fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Type IIX fibres.\"}"
