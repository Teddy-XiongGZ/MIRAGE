    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Annelids and arthropods are both segmented animals, meaning their bodies are divided into similar sections arranged along a longitudinal axis. This is a key characteristic of these two phyla. While some annelids do have a closed circulatory system, arthropods have an open circulatory system, so option B is incorrect. Gas exchange in these phyla can vary, and it's not always through a moist membrane, so option C is not universally true. Lastly, the development of sense organs can greatly vary among species within these phyla, making option D not a universally correct choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
