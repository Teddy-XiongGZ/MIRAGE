    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bladder washout is a procedure that is used to flush out the bladder with a solution. The solution used is typically sterile saline, not water. Using water for bladder washout in secondary care could potentially lead to an electrolyte imbalance. This is because water can dilute the electrolytes in the body, which can disrupt the balance of electrolytes. This can lead to a variety of health problems, including irregular heartbeats, weak bones, changes in blood pressure, and in severe cases, seizures or coma. The other options do not directly relate to the use of water for bladder washout.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
