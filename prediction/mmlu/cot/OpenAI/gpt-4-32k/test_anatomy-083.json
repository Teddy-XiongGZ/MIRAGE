    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place, so they are not involved in swallowing. The larynx is the voice box, and while it is part of the airway, it does not close or seal off during swallowing. The uvula is a small piece of soft tissue that hangs down at the back of the mouth. It does not close or seal off the airway during swallowing.
