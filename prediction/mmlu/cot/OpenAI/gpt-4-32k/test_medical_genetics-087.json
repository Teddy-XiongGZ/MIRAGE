    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Achondroplasia is a form of short-limbed dwarfism. The condition is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. These mutations lead to an abnormal version of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 that is constantly active. Instead of turning on and off in response to signals from growth factors, the altered receptor is always turned on. This constant activity inhibits the growth and development of bone and results in the short stature seen in achondroplasia. This type of mutation is known as a gain-of-function mutation because it leads to a protein with an altered function that is detrimental to the organism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. gain-of-function.\"}"
