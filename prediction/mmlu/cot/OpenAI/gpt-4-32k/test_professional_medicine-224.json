    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sore throat, fever, voice changes, and difficulty swallowing, along with the physical examination findings of erythema, edema, anterior displacement of the soft palate, uvula deviation, and tonsillar exudate, are suggestive of peritonsillar abscess (PTA). PTA is a complication of tonsillitis and is most common in young adults. Trismus, or difficulty opening the mouth, is a common finding due to inflammation and spasm of the internal pterygoid muscle. The most appropriate management of PTA is needle aspiration or incision and drainage to remove the pus, along with antibiotics to treat the infection. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy is used for severe inflammatory conditions, but it's not the first-line treatment for PTA. Oral nystatin therapy is used for fungal infections, which is not the case here. Salt water gargle can help soothe the throat but it won't treat the underlying condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Incision and drainage\"}"
