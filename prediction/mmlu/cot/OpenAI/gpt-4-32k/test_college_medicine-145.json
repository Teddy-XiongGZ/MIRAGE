    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactate is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism in the muscles. When it enters the circulation, it is not converted to urea in the liver, nor is it excreted via the kidneys. It is also not converted to glucose in the heart. Instead, it is taken up by other tissues, particularly the liver, where it is converted back into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. This glucose can then be used as an energy source by the body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
