    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactate is produced in the muscles during high-intensity exercise when the demand for energy is high. This happens when the body cannot produce enough energy through aerobic respiration due to a lack of oxygen, and instead switches to anaerobic respiration, which results in the production of lactate. This process is known as glycolysis. Therefore, lactate production does not increase when oxygen is readily available, as this would allow for aerobic respiration. It also does not increase when pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown, as pyruvate is a precursor to lactate. The pH of the muscle falling is a result of lactate production, not a cause. Therefore, the correct answer is that lactate production increases when glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
