    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The body uses different energy systems depending on the intensity and duration of the activity. For very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, the body would use the immediate energy system, also known as the ATP-PC system. This system uses stored ATP and phosphocreatine (PC) in the muscles to provide energy. ATP is used first, then PC is used to replenish ATP stores. Therefore, the initial energy source for such contractions would be ATP stores.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. ATP stores.\"}"
