    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood vessels. The level of the heart is the reference point for measuring blood pressure.

Therefore, measuring blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart would underestimate the blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
