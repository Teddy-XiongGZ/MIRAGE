    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cerebrovascular accident (CVA), also known as a stroke, in the area of the left internal capsule would affect the motor neurons that control the right leg. The internal capsule is a white matter structure situated in the inferomedial part of each cerebral hemisphere of the brain. It carries information past the basal ganglia, linking the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. Damage to the internal capsule can cause a type of paralysis known as spastic paralysis. This is because the internal capsule carries both upper motor neurons (which when damaged cause spastic paralysis) and lower motor neurons (which when damaged cause flaccid paralysis). However, in this case, the question specifies that the damage is to the motor neurons going to the right leg, which are upper motor neurons. Therefore, the correct answer is spastic paralysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
