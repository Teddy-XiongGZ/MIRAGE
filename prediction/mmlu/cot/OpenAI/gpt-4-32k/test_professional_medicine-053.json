    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and high blood pressure after cocaine use suggest a cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome. Cocaine causes coronary artery vasoconstriction and increased myocardial oxygen demand due to increased heart rate and blood pressure. Beta blockers like carvedilol and metoprolol are typically used to manage chest pain in acute coronary syndrome, but they are contraindicated in cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome because they can cause unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, leading to further vasoconstriction and worsening ischemia. Furosemide is a diuretic and would not directly address the patient's symptoms. Phentolamine is a nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist and can reverse cocaine-induced vasoconstriction, making it the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phentolamine\"}"
