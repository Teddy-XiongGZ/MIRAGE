    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of transcription, which involves the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) from a DNA template, occurs within the nucleus of a cell. This is because the DNA is located in the nucleus, and it is here that the necessary enzymes and other molecules needed for transcription are found. The mRNA then exits the nucleus and enters the cytosol, where it is translated into a protein on the ribosomes. Therefore, the transcription does not occur on the ribosomes or in the cytosol, and it is not limited to the period of cell division.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
