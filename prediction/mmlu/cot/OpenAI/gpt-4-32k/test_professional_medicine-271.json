    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the jaw, especially during physical exertion such as shoveling snow, are indicative of angina pectoris, a condition caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. The immediate treatment goal is to relieve the chest pain by improving myocardial oxygen supply and/or decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator that can increase blood flow to the heart and reduce myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing preload. Therefore, a drug that increases nitric oxide concentration would be the most appropriate immediate treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increases nitric oxide concentration\"}"
