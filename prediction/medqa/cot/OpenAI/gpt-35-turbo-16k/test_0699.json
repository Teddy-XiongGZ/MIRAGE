Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, often involving the extraocular muscles. The presence of ptosis and the worsening of symptoms in the evenings are typical features of myasthenia gravis. The patient's history of type I diabetes mellitus and family history of autoimmune disorders (Sjogren's syndrome) further support this diagnosis.
