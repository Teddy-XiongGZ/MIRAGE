The presence of non-tender erythematous lesions on the palms and soles is known as Osler's nodes, which are classic findings in infective endocarditis. The recent colonoscopy with an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer is a risk factor for infective endocarditis. The echocardiography findings of vegetations involving the mitral valve further support the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Given these findings, the most likely causative agent is Streptococcus bovis, which is commonly associated with colorectal cancer and can cause infective endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
