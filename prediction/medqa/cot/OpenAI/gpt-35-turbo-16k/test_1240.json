    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given information, we can infer that the disorder is likely a genetic condition. The presence of severe lip lacerations, missing portions of fingers, and a high level of uric acid in the urinalysis suggests a disorder known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This disorder is characterized by self-mutilating behaviors, neurological abnormalities, and increased uric acid production. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that the gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome, and males are more commonly affected due to having only one X chromosome. Female carriers of the gene may not show symptoms or may have milder symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is A. X-linked recessive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
