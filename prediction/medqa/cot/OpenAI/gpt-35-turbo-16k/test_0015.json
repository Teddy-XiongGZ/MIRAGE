    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 59-year-old overweight woman with a history of recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. She presents with severe abdominal pain, dull pain in her back, nausea, and vomiting. Her pain has no relation with food. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Given these findings, the most concerning diagnosis that should be excluded first is gallbladder cancer. While acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and pancreatitis can all cause abdominal pain, the presence of a calcified mass near the gallbladder raises suspicion for gallbladder cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Gallbladder cancer\"}"
