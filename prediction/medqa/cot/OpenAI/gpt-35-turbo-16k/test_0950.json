    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The description of the tissue sample from the normal thyroid gland indicates that the epithelium is composed of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. To determine which part of the female reproductive tract is also lined by this type of epithelium, we need to consider the characteristics of the different options. A. Ovaries: The epithelium of the ovaries is composed of a layer of simple cuboidal epithelium, which is similar to the description provided for the tissue sample from the thyroid gland. B. Vagina: The epithelium of the vagina is composed of stratified squamous epithelium, which is different from the description provided for the tissue sample from the thyroid gland. C. Fallopian tubes: The epithelium of the fallopian tubes is composed of simple columnar epithelium, which is different from the description provided for the tissue sample from the thyroid gland. D. Vulva: The vulva is not a part of the female reproductive tract and is composed of various types of epithelium, including stratified squamous epithelium. Based on this analysis, the part of the female reproductive tract that is most likely lined by the same type of epithelium as the tissue sample from the thyroid gland is the ovaries. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Ovaries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
