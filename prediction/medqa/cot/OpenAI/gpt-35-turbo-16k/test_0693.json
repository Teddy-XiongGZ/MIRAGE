    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of recurrent episodes of chest pain that wake her from sleep and occur at random times during the day, it is likely that she is experiencing episodes of angina. Angina is typically caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease. The fact that the pain resolves spontaneously and lasts for a short duration suggests that it is stable angina rather than unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Given that the patient has no significant risk factors for coronary artery disease and her physical examination is unremarkable, it is reasonable to start with medical management rather than invasive procedures like coronary angiography. The most appropriate initial treatment for stable angina is nitroglycerin, which is a vasodilator that helps to relieve chest pain by increasing blood flow to the heart. Isosorbide dinitrate is a long-acting nitrate that can be used for prophylaxis in patients with stable angina. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Isosorbide dinitrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
