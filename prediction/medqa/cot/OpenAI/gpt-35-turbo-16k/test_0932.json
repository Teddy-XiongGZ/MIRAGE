    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees. The patient's symptoms of bilateral knee pain that worsens with activity, improves with rest, and is associated with crepitus and bony enlargement are consistent with osteoarthritis. The physical examination findings of tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the knees and limited range of motion further support this diagnosis. To confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease, an imaging study would be indicated. While a complete blood count (CBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be useful in evaluating other conditions such as infection or inflammation, they are not specific for osteoarthritis. Therefore, the most appropriate study for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition would be an MRI of the knee.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
