    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this scenario has experienced a postpartum hemorrhage, as evidenced by the excessive bleeding and decrease in blood pressure. The most likely cause of the bleeding is uterine atony, which is the failure of the uterus to contract after delivery. The first step in managing uterine atony is to administer uterotonic medications, such as oxytocin, to stimulate uterine contractions. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to administer intravenous oxytocin (Choice B). Hysterectomy (Choice A) is a more invasive procedure and would not be the first-line treatment for uterine atony. Elevating the posterior fornix (Choice C) may be helpful in cases of cervical or vaginal lacerations, but it would not address the underlying cause of the bleeding. Red blood cell transfusion (Choice D) may be necessary if the patient continues to bleed and becomes hemodynamically unstable, but it is not the initial step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
