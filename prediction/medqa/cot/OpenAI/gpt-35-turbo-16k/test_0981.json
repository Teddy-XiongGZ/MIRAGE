    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and has sedating effects due to its ability to antagonize histamine H1 receptors in the central nervous system. Fexofenadine, on the other hand, is a second-generation antihistamine that has a lower affinity for H1 receptors in the brain, resulting in reduced sedation. Fexofenadine's reduced sedating effects are primarily due to its relative lipophobicity, which limits its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to H1 receptors in the central nervous system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
