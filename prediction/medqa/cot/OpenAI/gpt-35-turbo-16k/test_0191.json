    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae suggests a diagnosis of caudal regression syndrome (also known as sacral agenesis or caudal dysplasia). This condition is characterized by incomplete development of the lower spine and spinal cord. The strongest predisposing factor for caudal regression syndrome is maternal diabetes. Maternal diabetes, especially when poorly controlled, can lead to fetal malformations, including caudal regression syndrome. Maternal oligohydramnios, intrauterine alcohol exposure, and chromosome 18 trisomy are not typically associated with this specific condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Maternal diabetes\"}"
