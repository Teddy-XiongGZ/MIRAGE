    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea, which are suggestive of a hormonal disorder. The presence of high serum calcium levels (hypercalcemia) further supports this suspicion. The most likely diagnosis in this patient is a VIPoma, which is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIPoma can cause symptoms such as facial flushing, diarrhea, and weakness. The genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which increases the risk of developing VIPomas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
