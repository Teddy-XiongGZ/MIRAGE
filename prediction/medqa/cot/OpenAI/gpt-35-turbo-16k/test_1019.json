    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with excessive daytime somnolence, easy fatigability, and loud snoring, which are suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The overnight polysomnogram reveals 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is calculated by dividing the total number of apnea and hypopnea episodes by the number of hours of sleep. In this case, the AHI would be (12 + 30) / 7 = 6. This means that the patient's AHI is more than 5, indicating the presence of OSA. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
