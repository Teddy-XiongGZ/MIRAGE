    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of small esophageal varices with red spots indicates an increased risk of bleeding. The next best step to prevent bleeding in this patient with cirrhosis is to initiate nonselective beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, have been shown to reduce the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices by decreasing portal pressure. Endoscopic sclerotherapy is an option for the treatment of actively bleeding varices, but it is not the next best step in this patient who is not actively bleeding. Repeat endoscopy may be indicated in the future to monitor the progression of varices, but it is not the next best step at this time. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Nadolol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
