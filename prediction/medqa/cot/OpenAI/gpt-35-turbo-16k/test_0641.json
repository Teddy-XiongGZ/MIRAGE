    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in the scenario has poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has been experiencing symptoms such as myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and skin rashes. These symptoms have worsened over the past year, leading to missed work days. The patient has been on hydroxychloroquine but feels that it is not adequately controlling her symptoms. The physician decides to trial the patient on low-dose prednisone, which has successfully controlled her flares and allowed her to return to work full-time. Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication that can have several side effects, including bone loss and increased risk of fractures. Given the patient's age and the fact that she will be on long-term prednisone therapy, the most likely elevated risk for her would be a femoral neck fracture (choice A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
