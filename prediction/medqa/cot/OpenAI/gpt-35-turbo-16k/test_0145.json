    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with facial swelling, pitting edema of the extremities, periorbital edema, and mild abdominal distension. These findings are suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. The laboratory studies show hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin 2.1 g/dL), hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 270 mg/dL), and significant proteinuria (urine protein 4+). These findings further support the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. The most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease (MCD). MCD is characterized by normal findings on light microscopy, hence option D can be ruled out. The characteristic finding in MCD is diffuse effacement of podocyte foot processes on electron microscopy. However, this finding is not listed among the answer choices. The next most likely finding in MCD is mesangial proliferation on light microscopy, which is represented by option A. Therefore, the answer is A. Mesangial proliferation on light microscopy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
