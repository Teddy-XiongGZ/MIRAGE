    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman's younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. These symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Autosomal recessive disorders require both copies of the gene to be affected in order for the individual to have the disease. Since the woman's parents are healthy, it is likely that they are carriers of the disease. To determine the carrier status of the woman, we need to consider the probability of her being a carrier. Since her parents are healthy, they are most likely heterozygous carriers (Aa) for the disease. If both parents are heterozygous carriers, there is a 25% chance that the woman inherited two normal copies of the gene (aa), making her not a carrier. Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is 25%, which is option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
