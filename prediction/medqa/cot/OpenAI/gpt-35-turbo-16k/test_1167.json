    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and a harsh pansystolic murmur. The murmur becomes louder when the patient squats. These findings are suggestive of a congenital heart defect known as Tetralogy of Fallot. In Tetralogy of Fallot, there is a ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding aorta, pulmonary stenosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The murmur is caused by blood flowing through the VSD. The defect in Tetralogy of Fallot arises from a developmental abnormality in the formation of the infundibular septum, which is responsible for separating the aorta and pulmonary artery. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Infundibular septum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
