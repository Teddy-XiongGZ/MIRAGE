    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities suggests a skeletal dysplasia. The fact that his axial skeleton appears normal indicates that the condition is likely localized to the long bones. The activating mutation in a growth factor receptor suggests a disruption in a signaling pathway involved in bone growth. Endochondral ossification is the process by which long bones grow, with cartilage being replaced by bone. Therefore, the most likely disrupted physiologic process in this patient's condition is endochondral ossification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
