The laboratory studies show an elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which are nonspecific but can be seen in IBD. The CT scan findings of mural thickening and fat stranding in discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon are suggestive of Crohn's disease, a type of IBD.
