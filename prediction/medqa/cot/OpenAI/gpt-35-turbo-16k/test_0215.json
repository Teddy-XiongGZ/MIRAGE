    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes, along with the frustration of waking up multiple times at night to urinate despite dietary changes, it is important to evaluate for possible underlying causes. Given the absence of pain during urination and the negative physical examination findings, it is less likely that this is due to a urinary tract infection or renal pathology. However, it is important to rule out other potential causes, such as prostate disease. The best next step in the management of this patient would be to perform a digital rectal examination (DRE) to assess the prostate gland. DRE can help identify any abnormalities, such as an enlarged prostate, which could be causing the urinary symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Digital rectal examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
