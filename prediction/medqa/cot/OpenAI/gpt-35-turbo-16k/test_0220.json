    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of breathlessness and cough, along with the physical examination findings of inspiratory crackles over the lung bases, the most likely diagnosis is interstitial lung disease. The chest radiograph may show findings consistent with interstitial lung disease, such as diffuse reticular opacities or honeycombing. In interstitial lung disease, there is typically a restrictive pattern on spirometry, characterized by decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The FEV1/FVC ratio is usually normal or increased due to the decreased lung volumes. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Decreased FEV1 and FVC with decreased FEV1/FVC ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
