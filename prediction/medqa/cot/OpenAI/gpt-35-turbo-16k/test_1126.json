    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this scenario has suffered a severe head injury with a massive intracranial bleed. She is unresponsive, has dilated and non-reactive pupils, and is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. These findings are concerning for brain death. Brain death is defined as the irreversible loss of all cerebral and brainstem functions. To diagnose brain death, a clinical examination is performed to assess for the absence of all cerebral and brainstem functions. The most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death is to perform confirmatory tests. The confirmatory tests include electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), deep tendon reflex testing, and corneal reflex testing. Among these options, the most appropriate test to confirm brain death is EEG. EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain and can help confirm the absence of cerebral function. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Electroencephalography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
