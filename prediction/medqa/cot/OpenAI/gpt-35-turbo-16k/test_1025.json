    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in the question has sustained burns over 45% of her body, which is a severe injury. The initial management includes aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. However, 20 hours later, the patient develops several large, tarry black stools, which is indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This suggests that there is bleeding occurring in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Given the patient's history of burns and the timing of the symptoms, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools is decreased gastric blood flow. Severe burns can lead to decreased blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in ischemia and subsequent bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
