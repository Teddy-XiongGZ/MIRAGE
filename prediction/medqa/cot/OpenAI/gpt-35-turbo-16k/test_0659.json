    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in the question has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is presenting with urinary symptoms and multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan also shows a nodule in the right lung. Given the patient's history of prostate adenocarcinoma, the most likely concern is metastasis to the lung. When evaluating pulmonary nodules, certain characteristics on CT scans can raise suspicion for malignancy. The 'popcorn' pattern (A) is typically seen in benign hamartomas and is not associated with malignancy. A subsolid component (B) refers to a solid nodule with areas of ground-glass opacity or part-solid attenuation, and it is associated with a higher risk of malignancy. Extending fine striations (C) are seen in fibrotic lesions and are not specific for malignancy. Doubling time of < 1 month (D) is highly suggestive of malignancy. Therefore, the most likely finding on CT scans that would prompt the removal of pulmonary nodules of the same size as this patient's is a doubling time of < 1 month.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
