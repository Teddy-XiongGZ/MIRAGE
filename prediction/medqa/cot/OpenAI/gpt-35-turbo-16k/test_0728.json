    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most accurate predictor of gestational age in early pregnancy is the crown-rump length (CRL). The CRL is the measurement from the top of the baby's head (crown) to the bottom of the baby's buttocks (rump). It is typically measured between 7 and 13 weeks of gestation and is used to estimate the gestational age. The ratio of head to abdominal circumference, femoral length, and biparietal length are not as accurate in determining gestational age as the CRL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
