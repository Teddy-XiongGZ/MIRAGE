    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with fatigue and headaches two days after sustaining a right-sided subdural hematoma. The laboratory studies show hyponatremia (serum Na+ 130 mEq/L) and urine sodium concentration is less than 20 mEq/L. These findings suggest the presence of SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion). SIADH is a common complication of head trauma and can lead to hyponatremia. The most appropriate next step in management would be fluid restriction. This is because SIADH is characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. Fluid restriction helps to correct the hyponatremia by reducing the amount of free water intake and allowing the body to excrete excess water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Fluid restriction\"}"
