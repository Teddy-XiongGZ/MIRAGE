    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, we can narrow down the possible causes of his symptoms. The patient's pain and weakness in the right shoulder started after helping his son move, suggesting a possible injury. The fact that his symptoms worsened after going to the gym and lifting weights further supports the idea of an injury. On physical exam, there is prominent weakness of external rotation of the right upper extremity, as well as weakness in abduction of the right arm. When the patient is asked to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. These findings suggest a rotator cuff tear, which is a common injury in individuals who perform repetitive overhead activities or have sudden trauma to the shoulder. Among the choices provided, the most likely injured structure in this patient is the supraspinatus muscle, as it is responsible for abduction of the arm and is commonly involved in rotator cuff tears.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Supraspinatus\"}"
