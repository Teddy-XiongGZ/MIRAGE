    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has sickle cell disease, which is associated with functional asplenia. This means that the spleen is not functioning properly or has been removed. The spleen plays an important role in the immune system, particularly in fighting against encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Looking at the image, we can see that zone 1 is marked as the red pulp, which is responsible for filtering and removing old or damaged red blood cells. Zone 2 is marked as the white pulp, which contains lymphocytes and is involved in immune responses. Zone 3 is marked as the marginal zone, which is the boundary between the red and white pulp. Based on this information, dysfunction of zone 1 and zone 2 would predispose the patient to infections. Therefore, the answer is C. 1 and 2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1 and 2\"}"
