    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 71-year-old man with urinary hesitancy and nocturia, which are symptoms commonly associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The digital rectal exam showed a slightly enlarged prostate, further supporting the diagnosis of BPH. The serum PSA level of 6 ng/mL is within the normal range for the patient's age. Image A shows a transabdominal ultrasound, which is commonly used to evaluate the size and shape of the prostate. Based on these findings, the most appropriate medication for the patient's condition would be a medication that specifically targets the prostate and helps reduce its size. Finasteride is a medication that inhibits the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the main hormone responsible for prostate growth. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride can help shrink the prostate and alleviate symptoms of BPH. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Finasteride.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
