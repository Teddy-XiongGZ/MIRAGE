    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To compare the groups and determine if the changes in the measurements are statistically significant, we need to consider the type of data and the number of groups involved. In this study, the measurements are continuous variables (plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores) and there are three groups (pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, and placebo). Therefore, the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups would be Analysis of variance (ANOVA). ANOVA is used to compare means between three or more groups and determine if there are statistically significant differences among them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
