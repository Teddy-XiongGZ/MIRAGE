    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old boy with a history of recurrent ear infections and difficulty understanding speech. The otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy, indicating middle ear effusion. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss on both sides. These findings suggest that the patient has chronic otitis media with effusion (OME). The most appropriate next step in management for OME is tympanostomy tube insertion (choice B). Tympanostomy tubes help equalize pressure in the middle ear and allow for drainage of fluid, which can improve hearing and reduce the risk of recurrent infections. Adenoidectomy (choice A) may be considered in patients with persistent OME despite tube placement or in those with significant adenoid hypertrophy causing nasal obstruction. Antihistamine therapy (choice C) and corticosteroid therapy (choice D) are not indicated for the management of OME.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
