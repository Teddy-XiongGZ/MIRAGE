    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of a motor vehicle accident and subsequent weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities, the most likely diagnosis is a cervical spine fracture. Cervical spine fractures can occur as a result of high-impact trauma, such as a head-on collision. The weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities suggest damage to the spinal cord or nerve roots in the cervical region. This can lead to neurological deficits in the upper extremities while sparing the lower extremities. To confirm the diagnosis, a cervical spine radiograph or CT scan would be necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
