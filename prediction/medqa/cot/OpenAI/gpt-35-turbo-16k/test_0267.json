    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means it is carried on the X chromosome. Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. In this case, the father has hemophilia A, which means he has one affected X chromosome and one unaffected Y chromosome. The mother is unaffected, which means she has two unaffected X chromosomes. Since the father passes his X chromosome to his daughters, there is a 50% chance that each daughter will receive the affected X chromosome. Therefore, the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease is 50%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
