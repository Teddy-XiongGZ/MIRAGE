The fear is excessive and irrational, and it is significantly impacting her daily life and functioning. The best definitive treatment for specific phobias is exposure therapy, which is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Systematic desensitization is a specific type of exposure therapy that involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled and systematic way, while teaching them relaxation techniques to manage their anxiety.
