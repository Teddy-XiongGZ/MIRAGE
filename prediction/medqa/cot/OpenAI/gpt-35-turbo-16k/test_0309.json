It requires that patients have the right to be informed about their medical condition, the proposed treatment, and any potential risks or benefits associated with the treatment. In emergency situations where the patient is unconscious or unable to provide consent, the principle of implied consent may apply. Implied consent assumes that the patient would consent to life-saving interventions if they were able to do so.
