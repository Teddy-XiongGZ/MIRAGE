    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium. The primary defense against bacterial infections is the immune system, specifically the production of antibodies. Immunoglobulins are antibodies produced by B cells in response to an infection. IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin in the blood and is involved in long-term immunity. IgD is found on the surface of B cells and is involved in the activation of B cells. IgM is the first antibody produced in response to an infection and is involved in the primary immune response. IgA is found in mucosal secretions and plays a role in preventing infections at mucosal surfaces. In this case, the primary defense against Staphylococcus aureus and its toxins would be IgA, as the infection is localized to the skin and mucosal surfaces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Immunoglobulin- IgA\"}"
