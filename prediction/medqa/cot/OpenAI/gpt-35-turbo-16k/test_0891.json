    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 33-year-old woman at 26 weeks' gestation presenting with frequent contractions that are increasing in intensity. The cervical examination reveals a dilated cervix of 5 cm, 70% effaced, and a station of -2. These findings suggest that the patient is in preterm labor. The next step in management should be to attempt to stop the contractions and prevent preterm delivery. The most appropriate option for this is to initiate tocolytic therapy. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog that is used for cervical ripening and induction of labor, but it is not indicated for tocolysis. Dilation and evacuation is a procedure used for termination of pregnancy and is not appropriate in this case. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate nifedipine therapy, which is a calcium channel blocker commonly used for tocolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
