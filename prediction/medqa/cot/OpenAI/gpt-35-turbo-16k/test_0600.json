    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers during vaccine development for several reasons. First, conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses. This is important because IgG2 antibodies are more effective in opsonization and complement activation, leading to enhanced bacterial clearance. Second, conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability by preventing degradation of the polysaccharide component. Third, conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants by enhancing the immune response and promoting immunological memory. Therefore, the best response to the medical student's question would be that conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
