    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of coarse facies, short stature, joint stiffness, intellectual disability, and delayed developmental milestones is suggestive of a lysosomal storage disorder. Among the given options, the most likely substance to accumulate in the cells of this patient is heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate is associated with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), a group of lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in various tissues. The specific MPS associated with the symptoms described in the patient is MPS type III, also known as Sanfilippo syndrome. In Sanfilippo syndrome, there is a deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate, leading to its accumulation in the cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
