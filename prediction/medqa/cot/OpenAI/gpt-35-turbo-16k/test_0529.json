    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye suggests an acute vascular event. The absence of perception of light in the right eye indicates severe visual loss. The presence of a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula on fundoscopic examination suggests a cherry-red spot, which is characteristic of central retinal artery occlusion. This occurs when there is a sudden blockage of blood flow to the retina, leading to ischemia and subsequent loss of vision. The normal appearance of the optic disc suggests that the occlusion is at the level of the retinal artery rather than the optic nerve. Retinal detachment typically presents with a sudden, painless loss of vision, but it is not associated with a cherry-red spot. Acute angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with a sudden, painful loss of vision, and the intraocular pressure is usually elevated. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy typically presents with a sudden, painless loss of vision, but it is not associated with a cherry-red spot.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Central retinal artery occlusion\"}"
