    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur, which suggests a cardiac abnormality. The fixed splitting of S2 and the midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border are consistent with an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASD is a congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the atrial septum, allowing blood to shunt from the left atrium to the right atrium. This results in increased blood flow to the right side of the heart and increased pulmonary blood flow, leading to symptoms such as cyanosis and dyspnea. The patient's symptoms have worsened during pregnancy, suggesting that the physiological changes of pregnancy are exacerbating the shunting of blood through the ASD. The correct answer is therefore C. Increase in cardiac output.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
