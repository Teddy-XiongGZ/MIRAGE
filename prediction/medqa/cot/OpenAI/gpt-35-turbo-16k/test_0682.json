    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, as well as the chest radiograph and elevated IgE levels, the most likely diagnosis is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus, a common environmental fungus. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, coughing, and expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The presence of greenish sputum with specks of red suggests the presence of blood in the sputum, which can occur in ABPA. The radiographic findings of atelectasis and glove-finger shadows are also consistent with ABPA. Elevated IgE levels are a hallmark of ABPA. The most appropriate therapy for ABPA is systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce inflammation and control symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Prednisone\"}"
