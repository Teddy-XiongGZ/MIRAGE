    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, certain antimalarial drugs are safe to use for prophylaxis against malaria. However, the choice of drug depends on the specific region of travel and the gestational age of the woman. In this case, the woman is planning to travel to Ethiopia, which is known to have chloroquine-resistant malaria. Therefore, chloroquine is not the most suitable option. Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy as it can cause fetal harm. Mefloquine is generally considered safe to use in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, but it is not the drug of choice for Ethiopia due to increasing resistance. Proguanil, in combination with atovaquone, is the recommended drug for pre-exposure prophylaxis against malaria in Ethiopia. Therefore, the most suitable drug for this woman would be Proguanil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
