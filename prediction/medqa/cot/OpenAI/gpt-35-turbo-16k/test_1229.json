    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 31-year-old woman at 32 weeks' gestation presenting with clear vaginal discharge and positive nitrazine testing, indicating rupture of membranes. The fetal heart rate is reactive and there are uterine contractions, suggesting preterm labor. The most appropriate next step in management would be to administer betamethasone to promote fetal lung maturation and ampicillin to prevent group B streptococcal infection. Induction of labor or cesarean section would not be indicated at this time as the patient is not in active labor and the fetal heart rate is reassuring. Progesterone is not indicated in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor\"}"
