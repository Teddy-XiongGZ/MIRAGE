    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given information, the patient is at 20 weeks of gestation and has a male fetus with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). To determine the additional finding most likely to be observed in this fetus, we need to consider the associated features of the given findings. Microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and a medium-sized VSD are characteristic features of trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome). Among the given choices, cleft palate, epicanthal folds, and micropthlamia are not typically associated with trisomy 18. However, a prominent occiput is a common finding in trisomy 18. Therefore, the most likely additional finding to be observed in this fetus is a prominent occiput.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
