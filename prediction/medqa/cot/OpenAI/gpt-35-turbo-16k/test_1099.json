    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's medical records show a total colectomy, which means her entire colon has been removed. This suggests that she had a condition that required the removal of her colon. Additionally, the patient reports that she has had annual colonoscopies since she was 10 years old because her father had 'a condition with his colon.' Based on this information, it is likely that the patient's disease is hereditary. Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern occurs when a disease is caused by a mutation in one copy of a gene and only one affected parent is needed to pass on the disease to their children. Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern occurs when a disease is caused by mutations in both copies of a gene and both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene to pass on the disease to their children. X-linked dominant inheritance pattern occurs when a disease is caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome and only one affected parent is needed to pass on the disease to their children. Given that the patient's father had a condition with his colon and the patient had a total colectomy, it is likely that the disease is hereditary and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means that the patient only needs one affected parent to inherit the disease. Therefore, the answer is A. Autosomal dominant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
