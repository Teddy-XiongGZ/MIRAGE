    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand the significance of phenylketonuria (PKU) in pregnancy. PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood. High levels of phenylalanine can be toxic to the developing fetus. Next, we need to assess the patient's current phenylalanine level, which is 20.2 mg/dL, significantly higher than the normal range of <2 mg/dL. Based on this information, we can determine the most appropriate response to the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
