    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a 6-month history of progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers of her right hand. She recently retired after working as a typist for 28 years, which suggests repetitive use of her hands. Physical examination findings of joint-line tenderness, decreased range of motion, and nodules over the distal interphalangeal joints are consistent with osteoarthritis. X-ray findings of narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes further support the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition is degenerative disease of the joints.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
