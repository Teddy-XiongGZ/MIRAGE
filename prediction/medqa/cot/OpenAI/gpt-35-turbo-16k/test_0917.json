    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 5-year-old boy with a history of asthma and multiple hospitalizations. He presents with sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis. Serum studies show low glucose concentration (22 mg/dL) and low potassium concentration (2.4 mEq/L). Administration of dextrose infusion improves his symptoms and normalizes his glucose concentration. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness, and serum studies show low glucose concentration (19 mg/dL), high insulin concentration (108 mIU/L), and low C-peptide concentration (0.3 ng/mL). These findings are consistent with hypoglycemia due to exogenous insulin administration. The most likely diagnosis in this case is factitious disorder imposed on another (formerly known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy), in which a caregiver intentionally induces illness in another person, often a child, to gain attention or sympathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
