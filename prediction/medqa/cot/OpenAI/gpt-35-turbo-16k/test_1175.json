    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with recurrent wrist and neck pain, along with stiffness in the fingers in the morning that improves throughout the day. These symptoms, along with the erythematous and tender metacarpophalangeal joints, are suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis. Given the patient's age and family history of fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a possible diagnosis. To confirm the diagnosis of RA, the most helpful test would be the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. These antibodies are highly specific for RA and can be detected in the blood. Synovial fluid analysis may be helpful in other types of arthritis, but it is not specific for RA. Rheumatoid factor is another test that can be used to support the diagnosis of RA, but it is less specific than anti-CCP antibodies. X-ray of the cervical spine would not be the most helpful test in this case, as it would not provide information specific to the diagnosis of RA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody\"}"
