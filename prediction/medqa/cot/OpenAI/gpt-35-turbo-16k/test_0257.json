    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in the question has phenylketonuria (PKU), which is a genetic disorder characterized by the inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. This leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and can cause various complications. The patient's elevated serum phenylalanine concentration and the resolution of hyperphenylalaninemia with a special diet confirm the diagnosis of PKU. The presence of blue eyes, pale skin, and blonde hair suggests a deficiency in melanin production, which is a characteristic finding in PKU. Generalized hypotonia and persistent head lag are also common findings in PKU. The markedly elevated serum prolactin level is likely due to the disruption of dopamine synthesis, as phenylalanine is a precursor for dopamine. The supplementation of which of the following substances is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition?\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tetrahydrobiopterin\"}"
