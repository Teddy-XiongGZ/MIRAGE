    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with acute-onset chest pain, dilated pupils, perforated nasal septum, and ST segment elevation on EKG. These findings are consistent with cocaine intoxication. Cocaine is a sympathomimetic drug that blocks the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. This leads to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, resulting in increased sympathetic activity and vasoconstriction. The elevated blood pressure and tachycardia seen in this patient are consistent with the sympathomimetic effects of cocaine. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
