    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Swan-Ganz catheter is used to measure various pressures in the heart. The pulmonary wedge pressure is a measurement of the pressure in the left atrium and left ventricle. It is obtained by inflating a balloon on the catheter and wedging it into a small pulmonary artery branch. A normal pulmonary wedge pressure is typically around 10 mmHg. Since the question asks for the normal values for pressures obtained from the right ventricle, we need to consider the pressures in the right side of the heart. The right ventricular pressure is typically lower than the left ventricular pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a lower value than 10 mmHg. Answer choice A (25/10 mmHg) is incorrect because the right ventricular pressure is not expected to be higher than the left ventricular pressure. Answer choice B (25/5 mmHg) is also incorrect because the right ventricular pressure is not expected to be higher than the left ventricular pressure, and the diastolic pressure is unlikely to be as low as 5 mmHg. Answer choice C (10/0 mmHg) is a possibility because the right ventricular pressure could be similar to the pulmonary wedge pressure, which is 10 mmHg. Answer choice D (100/70 mmHg) is incorrect because these values are too high for the right ventricular pressure. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is C (10/0 mmHg).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
