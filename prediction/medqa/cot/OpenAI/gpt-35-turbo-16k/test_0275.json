    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exertion, the demand for oxygen and nutrients by the myocardium increases. To meet this increased demand, the coronary blood flow needs to be increased. Adenosine is a substance that is released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion. Adenosine is a potent vasodilator that acts on the coronary arterioles to increase blood flow to the myocardium. Inorganic phosphate, prostaglandin E2, and transforming growth factor beta are not substances that are released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
