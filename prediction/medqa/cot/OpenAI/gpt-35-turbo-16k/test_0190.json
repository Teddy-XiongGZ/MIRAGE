    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of intermittent chest discomfort, shortness of breath, shakiness, and excessive sweating, along with the history of anxiety and avoidance behavior, the most likely diagnosis is panic disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, which are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that reach a peak within minutes. The symptoms described by the patient are consistent with panic attacks. The best medication for the long-term management of panic disorder is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as Citalopram (Choice A). SSRIs are considered first-line treatment for panic disorder and have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of panic attacks. Lithium (Choice B) is not indicated for panic disorder. Propranolol (Choice C) is a beta-blocker that can be used for short-term relief of symptoms during specific situations (e.g., performance anxiety), but it is not the best choice for long-term management of panic disorder. Quetiapine (Choice D) is an atypical antipsychotic that may be used as an adjunctive treatment for panic disorder in some cases, but it is not the best initial choice for long-term management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
