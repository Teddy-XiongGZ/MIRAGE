    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is folliculitis. The presence of red papules and pustules scattered across the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks, sparing the limbs, along with inflammation of the hair follicles, is consistent with folliculitis. The culture results indicate the presence of motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive.
