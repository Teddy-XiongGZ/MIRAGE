    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing solid food that gets stuck in the chest behind the sternum suggest an esophageal motility disorder. The fact that drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing rules out any structural obstruction in the esophagus. The patient's history of heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole suggests that the symptoms are not due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The absence of coughing or nasal regurgitation rules out Zenker diverticulum. The absence of hoarseness or weight loss makes malignancy less likely. The patient's history of asthma and eczema raises suspicion for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), which is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. EoE can cause dysphagia, particularly for solid food, and is often associated with a history of atopy. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is eosinophilic esophagitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
