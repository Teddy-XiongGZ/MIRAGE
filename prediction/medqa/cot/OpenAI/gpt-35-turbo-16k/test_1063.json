    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Atracurium is a neuromuscular blocking agent that is commonly used during surgery to induce muscle relaxation. It works by competing with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction, which prevents the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This results in muscle paralysis, allowing for easier surgical access and manipulation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
