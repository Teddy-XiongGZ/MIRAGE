    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a nurse who has a positive PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration. This indicates exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, she denies any symptoms suggestive of active tuberculosis infection. Her vital signs are within normal limits and her chest radiograph is unremarkable. Given the absence of symptoms and normal findings, the most appropriate management for this patient is no management indicated. Treatment with isoniazid (choice A) is indicated for patients with a positive PPD skin test and no evidence of active tuberculosis infection, but it is not necessary in this case as the patient is asymptomatic. Repeat PPD in 1 week (choice C) is not necessary as the initial PPD test is already positive. Treatment with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (choice D) is indicated for patients with active tuberculosis infection, which is not the case for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. No management indicated\"}"
