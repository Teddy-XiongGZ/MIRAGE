    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the therapeutic index, we need to determine the ratio of the effective dose to the toxic dose. In this case, the effective dose is the dose at which patients demonstrated improvement, and the toxic dose is the dose at which patients had a treatment-related adverse event. From the given data, the effective doses are: 10 mg dose - 6/59 patients demonstrated improvement 20 mg dose - 19/49 patients demonstrated improvement 30 mg dose - 26/53 patients demonstrated improvement 40 mg dose - 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement The toxic doses are: 20 mg dose - 5/49 patients had a treatment-related adverse event 40 mg dose - 11/51 patients had a treatment-related adverse event 60 mg dose - 15/42 patients had a treatment-related adverse event 80 mg dose - 23/47 patients had a treatment-related adverse event 100 mg dose - 47/52 patients had a treatment-related adverse event To calculate the therapeutic index, we need to find the ratio of the highest effective dose to the lowest toxic dose. From the given data, the highest effective dose is 40 mg (46/51 patients demonstrated improvement) and the lowest toxic dose is 20 mg (5/49 patients had a treatment-related adverse event). Therefore, the therapeutic index is 40 mg / 20 mg = 2. The closest option to 2 is option C. 2.5.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
