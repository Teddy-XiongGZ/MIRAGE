    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given that the mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, it is important to consider the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to the newborn. The fact that the mother's HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery suggests that she has a relatively low viral load, which reduces the risk of transmission. However, it is still necessary to assess the newborn for HIV infection. The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant would be to perform HIV DNA testing. This test can detect the presence of HIV proviral DNA in the infant's blood, which indicates HIV infection. Administering zidovudine as a prophylactic measure is not necessary in this case, as the mother received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. HIV RNA testing may be used to confirm HIV infection, but it is not the initial test of choice. Reassurance and follow-up alone would not be sufficient, as it is important to confirm or rule out HIV infection in the newborn.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. HIV DNA testing\"}"
