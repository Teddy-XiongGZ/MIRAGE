    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of anxiety, trouble with sleep, palpitations, and fatigue, along with physical exam findings of diaphoresis, warm skin, and diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with thyroid bruits. These findings are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The laboratory studies show a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) level, which further support the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. In pregnancy, the treatment of choice for hyperthyroidism is propylthiouracil (PTU) due to its lower risk of causing fetal hypothyroidism compared to methimazole. Radioiodine therapy and thyroidectomy are contraindicated in pregnancy as they carry a risk of fetal hypothyroidism. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is B. Propylthiouracil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
