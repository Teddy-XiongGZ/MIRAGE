    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea, we need to analyze the graph shown in figure A. We should look for the point on the graph where the concentration of urea in the tubular fluid is divided by the concentration of urea in the plasma. Based on the graph, it appears that the ratio is highest at point C. Therefore, the answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
