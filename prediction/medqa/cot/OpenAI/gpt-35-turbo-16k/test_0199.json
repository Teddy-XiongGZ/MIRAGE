    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation of recurrent urinary tract infections in a 2-year-old girl with bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis suggests a possible congenital anomaly of the urinary tract. The voiding cystourethrography showing retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition is indicative of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is a common cause of recurrent urinary tract infections in children. VUR is characterized by the abnormal flow of urine from the bladder back into the ureters and potentially into the kidneys. The most likely finding on histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen in a patient with VUR is cortical thinning with tubular atrophy, as chronic reflux of urine can lead to progressive renal damage and scarring. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
