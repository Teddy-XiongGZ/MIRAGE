    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient most likely has a knee ligament injury. The fact that she felt a 'pop' and experienced severe throbbing pain and rapid swelling suggests a significant injury. The positive anterior drawer and Lachman's tests indicate instability in the knee joint. The anterior drawer test specifically assesses the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), while the Lachman's test is also indicative of ACL injury. Therefore, the structure that she has most likely injured is the ACL. The ACL functions to prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. This means that it helps to stabilize the knee joint by preventing the tibia from moving too far forward in relation to the femur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur\"}"
