    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this case had severe internal bleeding due to trauma and underwent emergency surgery to remove severely damaged tissues. After surgery, the patient developed target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. These findings suggest that the patient is experiencing hemolysis, which can occur as a result of tissue damage and release of intracellular contents. The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is consistent with the mechanism of action of a 30S ribosome inhibitor. This class of drugs, which includes antibiotics such as tetracycline, can cause hemolysis by binding to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting protein synthesis. This can lead to the release of intracellular contents and subsequent hemolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
