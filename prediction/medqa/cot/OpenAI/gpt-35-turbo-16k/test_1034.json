    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a small whistling noise when she respires through her nose, which is appreciated on physical exam. This suggests a problem with the nasal airflow. Option A, post-operative swelling, is unlikely to cause a whistling noise. Option B, a septal hematoma causing a perforation, would typically present with other symptoms such as nasal obstruction or bleeding. Option D, excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow, is not a common cause of a whistling noise. Option C, a deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow, is the most likely cause of the whistling noise as it can lead to turbulent airflow and create a whistling sound. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
