    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of difficulty concentrating, fatigue, decreased appetite, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities are consistent with a diagnosis of depression. The fact that he is a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan suggests that his symptoms may be related to his military experience. However, the duration of his symptoms (2 months) and the presence of cognitive symptoms (difficulty concentrating, speaking more slowly) make major depressive disorder the most likely diagnosis. Adjustment disorder is characterized by the development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor, but the duration of symptoms is typically shorter (less than 6 months). Acute stress disorder is characterized by the development of dissociative symptoms and occurs within 3 days to 4 weeks after exposure to a traumatic event. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by the development of intrusive symptoms, avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, negative alterations in mood and cognition, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. While PTSD is a possibility given the patient's military history, the duration of symptoms (2 months) and the absence of specific PTSD symptoms (e.g. intrusive thoughts, avoidance) make major depressive disorder a more likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Major depressive disorder\"}"
