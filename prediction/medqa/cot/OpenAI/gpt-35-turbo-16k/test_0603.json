    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a painless, nonpruritic skin lesion on her right thigh that has slowly increased in size over the past weeks. The lesion is hyperpigmented and measures 0.8 cm. When the lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a dermatofibroma. Dermatofibromas are benign skin lesions that commonly occur on the extremities. They are usually painless and can slowly increase in size over time. On physical examination, dermatofibromas are typically hyperpigmented papules that have a characteristic 'dimple sign' - when the lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. Cherry hemangiomas are red, dome-shaped papules that are typically not painful and do not retract when squeezed. Actinic keratosis is a precancerous skin lesion that is usually scaly and erythematous, and seborrheic keratosis is a benign skin lesion that is typically raised and waxy in appearance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
