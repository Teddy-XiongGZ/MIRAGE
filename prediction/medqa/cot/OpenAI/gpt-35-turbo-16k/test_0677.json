    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the history of a fall from the changing table and the presence of physical findings such as subconjunctival hemorrhage and multiple bruises, child abuse should be suspected. The initial step in the management of a suspected child abuse case is to involve social services. Social services will be able to assess the situation, ensure the safety of the child, and initiate appropriate investigations and interventions. CT scan of the head may be indicated if there are signs of head trauma, but it is not the best initial step. Family counseling may be necessary in the long term, but it is not the best initial step. Rule out medical conditions may be considered, but the history and physical findings strongly suggest child abuse, so involving social services is the priority.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
