This suggests a myopathy rather than a neuropathy. The muscle biopsy revealing CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium is characteristic of an inflammatory myopathy. Among the options provided, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis, which is characterized by inflammation of the skeletal muscles. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can cause muscle weakness, but it typically presents with other symptoms such as joint pain, rash, and systemic involvement. Polymyalgia rheumatica is characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulders and hips, but it does not typically cause weakness. Dermatomyositis is another inflammatory myopathy, but it is characterized by skin involvement, such as a heliotrope rash and Gottron papules, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
