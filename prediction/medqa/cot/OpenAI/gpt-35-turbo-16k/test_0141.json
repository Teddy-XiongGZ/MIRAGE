    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, she likely has Cushing's syndrome. The elevated serum cortisol levels, low ACTH levels, and lack of suppression with high dose dexamethasone suggest an adrenal source of excess cortisol production.
