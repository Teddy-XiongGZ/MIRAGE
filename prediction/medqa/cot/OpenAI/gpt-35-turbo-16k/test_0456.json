    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant is three days old and presents with yellow skin, poor latch during breastfeeding, and inadequate milk intake. The fact that the baby is making stools 2 times per day suggests that there is no obstruction in the biliary system. Breast milk jaundice is a common cause of prolonged jaundice in breastfed infants, typically appearing after the first week of life. Breastfeeding jaundice, on the other hand, occurs in the first few days of life and is usually due to inadequate milk intake. Sepsis is unlikely in this case as the infant appears well and is sleeping for 7-8 hours at night. Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia is also unlikely as the presentation is not consistent with normal newborn jaundice. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation is B. Breastfeeding jaundice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
