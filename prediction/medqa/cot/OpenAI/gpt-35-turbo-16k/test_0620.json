    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is being given a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. This indicates that the diuretic is acting on the distal part of the nephron. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts on the ascending loop of Henle, not the distal tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that acts on the early distal tubule, not the cortical collecting tubule. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that acts on the proximal tubule, not the cortical collecting tubule. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts on the cortical collecting tubule by blocking the Na+ channels. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Triamterene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
