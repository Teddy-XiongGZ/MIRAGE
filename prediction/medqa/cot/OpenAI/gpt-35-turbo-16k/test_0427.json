    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that works by inhibiting the enzyme alpha-glucosidase in the small intestine. This enzyme is responsible for cleaving glycosidic bonds, which are the bonds that link sugar molecules together. By inhibiting alpha-glucosidase, miglitol prevents the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simple sugars, thereby reducing the absorption of glucose from the intestine. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Glycosidic bonds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
