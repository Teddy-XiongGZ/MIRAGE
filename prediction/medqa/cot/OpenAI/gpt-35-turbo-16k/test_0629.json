    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history and physical exam findings, the patient most likely has a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. The mechanism of injury, with a blow to the front of the leg, is consistent with a PCL injury. The finding of a mild knee effusion and the ability to push the knee posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion further support this diagnosis. The PCL runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle to the lateral aspect of the tibia. Therefore, the anatomic structure that is most likely injured in this patient is the PCL, which runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
