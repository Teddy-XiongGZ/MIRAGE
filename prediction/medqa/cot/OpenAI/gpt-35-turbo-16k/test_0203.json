    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and recent travel history, it is likely that he has contracted a parasitic infection. The presence of severe headaches, fever, and swelling of the right eyelid suggests the possibility of African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. The indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg may be a sign of cutaneous involvement. Given that the patient recently visited Ethiopia, which is an endemic area for African trypanosomiasis, the most appropriate treatment option would be Sodium stibogluconate (Choice D). Sodium stibogluconate is the drug of choice for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis. Benznidazole (Choice A) is used for the treatment of Chagas disease, which is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic in South America. Ivermectin (Choice B) is used for the treatment of various parasitic infections, but it is not the first-line treatment for African trypanosomiasis. Mebendazole (Choice C) is used for the treatment of helminthic infections, such as pinworms and roundworms, and would not be effective against trypanosomiasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
