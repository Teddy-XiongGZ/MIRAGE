    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with pruritus and a hypopigmented rash on his upper body, which started after returning from a trip to the Bahamas. The rash initially started as a single lesion on his upper back but has since extended to his shoulders. He has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and has been sexually active with multiple partners. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is tinea versicolor, which is a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia species. To confirm the diagnosis, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation should be performed. This test involves scraping the skin and examining the sample under a microscope after treatment with KOH, which helps to visualize the characteristic \"spaghetti and meatballs\" appearance of the yeast cells and hyphae. Wood lamp examination is used to diagnose certain fungal infections, but it is not the most appropriate test for tinea versicolor. Skin culture and skin biopsy are not necessary for the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Potassium hydroxide preparation\"}"
