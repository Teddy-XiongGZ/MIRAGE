    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension. His blood pressure measurements in the past have ranged from 160 - 170/80 - 100 mmHg. Today, his pressure is 150/100 mmHg with a pulse of 65/min while on hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril. Physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 at the right upper sternal border. The most common cause of his hypertension is likely related to his physical exam findings. A II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 at the right upper sternal border is consistent with aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis can lead to increased afterload, which can cause hypertension. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Aortic stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
