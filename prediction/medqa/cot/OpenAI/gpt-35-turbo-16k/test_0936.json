    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis. The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain that is worsened by palpation of the left lower quadrant, which is known as Rovsing's sign and is suggestive of appendicitis. The patient also has a history of constipation, which can be a risk factor for appendicitis. Given the severity of the pain and the need for analgesia with morphine, it is important to further evaluate the patient to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management. The next best step in management would be a CT scan. CT scan is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing appendicitis, as it has a high sensitivity and specificity. It can help visualize the inflamed appendix and assess for complications such as perforation or abscess formation. Abdominal radiograph would not be helpful in this case, as it does not provide sufficient detail to diagnose appendicitis. \u00df-hCG would be indicated if there is suspicion of pregnancy, but it is not the next best step in this case. Stool occult blood testing is not indicated in the evaluation of acute appendicitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. CT scan\"}"
