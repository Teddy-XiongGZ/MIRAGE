    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemoptysis (blood in coughed tissue), along with the finding of a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, the most likely diagnosis is pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a condition where a blood clot (thrombus) travels to the lungs and blocks the pulmonary arteries. In this case, the patient's symptoms and the presence of a filling defect in the pulmonary vessels suggest a pulmonary embolism. The fact that the patient's symptoms worsen with breathing or coughing is also consistent with this diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism can be caused by a variety of factors, including inherited conditions that increase the risk of blood clot formation. The most likely mode of inheritance for the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is autosomal dominant, as this mode of inheritance is commonly associated with inherited conditions that increase the risk of blood clot formation, such as factor V Leiden mutation or antithrombin deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Autosomal dominant\"}"
