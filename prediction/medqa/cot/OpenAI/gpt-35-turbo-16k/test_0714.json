    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation of sudden onset excruciating chest pain that radiates to the back, along with the presence of a heart murmur and joint hypermobility, aortic dissection should be suspected. Aortic dissection is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. The most common location for an aortic dissection is the ascending aorta, which can cause the pain to radiate to the back. The weak distal pulses suggest compromised blood flow. Given these findings, the most likely murmur to be found in this patient is a diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is consistent with aortic regurgitation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
