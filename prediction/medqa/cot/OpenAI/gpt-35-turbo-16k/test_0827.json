    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 28-year-old woman presenting with amenorrhea, or the absence of menstrual periods. She has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative, ruling out pregnancy as the cause of her amenorrhea. Her past medical history is significant for forearm fractures sustained in a car crash 3 months ago. She has also been experiencing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision and recurrent headaches. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea (milk production from the breasts) and temporal field visual defects. These findings suggest a pituitary tumor, specifically a prolactinoma, which is a benign tumor that secretes prolactin. Prolactin inhibits the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, which in turn inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH are necessary for normal menstrual function. Therefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for this patient's amenorrhea is inhibition of GnRH release.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
