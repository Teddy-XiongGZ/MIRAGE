    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child in question is a 21-month-old boy who has deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently. He has a family history of developmental dysplasia of the hip in his sister. On examination, the knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together. The gait is unremarkable. The child's height and weight percentiles are within normal limits. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is genu varum, also known as bowlegs. Genu varum is a normal physiologic variant in toddlers and usually resolves spontaneously by the age of 3 years. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be reassurance and follow-up.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Reassurance and follow-up\"}"
