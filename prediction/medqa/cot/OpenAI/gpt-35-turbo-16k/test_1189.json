    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of upsetting dreams, anxiety, disturbing flashbacks, intense fear of loud noises, and sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks are consistent with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. In this case, the patient's symptoms are directly related to his experiences during active duty in Iraq. Acute stress disorder is a possibility, but the duration of symptoms (7 weeks) exceeds the time frame for acute stress disorder, which typically lasts for a maximum of 4 weeks. Performance anxiety is not the most likely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms are not related to performance-related situations. Panic attack is also not the most likely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms are not limited to sudden and intense episodes of fear or panic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Posttraumatic stress disorder\"}"
