    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is likely that she is experiencing a contact dermatitis reaction to the silver earrings. Contact dermatitis is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which is a cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction. This type of reaction occurs when sensitized T cells come into contact with the allergen, leading to an inflammatory response.
