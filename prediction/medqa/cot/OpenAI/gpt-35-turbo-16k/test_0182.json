    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a left breast lump under his nipple. The lump is tender to touch but has no overlying skin changes. He has no breast discharge. On examination, the patient has tanner IV pubic hair and normal testicular volume and consistency. The most likely etiology of this patient's condition is pubertal gynecomastia, which is a benign enlargement of the breast tissue in males during puberty. This is a common finding and is usually self-limited, resolving within 6 months to 2 years. It is thought to be due to an imbalance between estrogen and androgen levels during puberty. Other causes of breast enlargement in males, such as Klinefelter syndrome, lipomastia (pseudogynecomastia), and testicular cancer, are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
