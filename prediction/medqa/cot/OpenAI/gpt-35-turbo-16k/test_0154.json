    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a generalized rash, severe itching, fever, headache, and muscle pain. He returned from a camping trip 1 week ago and attends a daycare center. Examination of the skin shows macules, papules, crusted lesions, and fluid-filled vesicles. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus infection). Measles typically presents with a prodrome of fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downward. Urushiol-induced dermatitis is caused by contact with poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac and typically presents with linear streaks of vesicles and bullae. Rubella presents with a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downward, along with lymphadenopathy and arthralgias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
