    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient is at 42 weeks' gestation, which is considered post-term. Post-term pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of complications. The most common complication in post-term pregnancies is meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Meconium is the first stool passed by a newborn, and if the baby is post-term, there is a higher chance of passing meconium in utero. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid can be aspirated by the baby during delivery, leading to respiratory distress and potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, MAS is a more specific complication associated with post-term pregnancies. Therefore, the answer choice is C. Meconium aspiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
