    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is essential tremor. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder characterized by bilateral, symmetric, postural or kinetic tremor that typically affects the hands. It is often exacerbated by stress or anxiety and improves with alcohol consumption. The patient's history of intermittent shaking of his hands, the high frequency bilateral hand tremor on exam, and the family history of Parkinson disease in his father are all consistent with essential tremor. The first-line treatment for essential tremor is a beta blocker, such as propranolol. Propranolol has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity of essential tremor. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Propranolol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
