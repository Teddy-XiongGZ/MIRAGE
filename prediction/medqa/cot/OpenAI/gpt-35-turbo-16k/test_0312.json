    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of fatigue, low back pain, and laboratory findings of elevated calcium, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest a possible diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The presence of large eosinophilic casts on renal biopsy further supports this diagnosis. In multiple myeloma, the bone marrow is infiltrated by plasma cells, leading to the production of abnormal proteins. These abnormal proteins can cause various complications, including renal dysfunction. Given the renal involvement, it is important to consider the potential effects on the peripheral blood smear. In multiple myeloma, the most likely finding on peripheral blood smear is the presence of rouleaux formation, which is characterized by linear aggregations of red blood cells. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Linear aggregations of red blood cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
