    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The yellowing of the skin in this one-week-old infant is likely due to physiological jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. Physiological jaundice occurs when there is an excess of bilirubin in the blood, which is a normal byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells. In newborns, the liver is still immature and may not be able to process bilirubin efficiently, leading to its accumulation in the blood and subsequent yellowing of the skin. In this case, the infant is otherwise healthy, with no signs of distress or feeding difficulties. Therefore, the best treatment for physiological jaundice in this infant would be to continue normal breastfeeding. Breast milk helps to promote bowel movements, which can aid in the elimination of bilirubin from the body. Additionally, breastfeeding provides essential nutrients and antibodies that are important for the infant's overall health and development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Continue normal breast feeding\"}"
