    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, we need to calculate the z-score and then find the corresponding probability using the standard normal distribution table. The formula for calculating the z-score is: z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where x is the value we want to find the probability for, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard error. In this case, x = 18 g/dL, \u03bc = 17 g/dL, and \u03c3 = 0.1 g/dL. Calculating the z-score: z = (18 - 17) / 0.1 = 10. Now, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find the probability associated with a z-score of 10. Looking at the table, we can see that the probability associated with a z-score of 10 is extremely close to 1. In fact, it is so close to 1 that we can say with confidence that the probability of a subject having a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL is 99%. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 99%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
