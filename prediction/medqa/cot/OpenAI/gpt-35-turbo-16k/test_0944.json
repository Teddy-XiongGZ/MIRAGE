    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps, along with laboratory findings of hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and acute kidney injury. These symptoms and findings are consistent with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which can occur in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) undergoing chemotherapy. TLS is characterized by the release of intracellular contents, such as potassium and uric acid, into the bloodstream, leading to electrolyte imbalances and kidney damage. The most effective intervention to prevent TLS is intravenous hydration, which helps to maintain adequate urine output and prevent the concentration of uric acid and other electrolytes in the urine. Urine alkalinization, rasburicase, and allopurinol are all treatments for TLS once it has occurred, but they are not the most effective preventive measures. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Intravenous hydration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
