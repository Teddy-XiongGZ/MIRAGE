    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Abnormal discharge from both nipples in a male patient is concerning for galactorrhea, which is the production of breast milk in the absence of pregnancy or breastfeeding. Galactorrhea is commonly caused by an increase in prolactin levels. Prolactin is a hormone that stimulates milk production. Several medications can cause an increase in prolactin levels, leading to galactorrhea. The medications that are known to cause an increase in prolactin levels include antipsychotics such as haloperidol, fluphenazine, and risperidone. Bromocriptine, on the other hand, is a dopamine agonist that is used to treat hyperprolactinemia and suppress prolactin secretion. Therefore, bromocriptine is NOT likely to be the cause of galactorrhea in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
