    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lymphatic system is responsible for the spread of cancer cells to distant sites. In this case, the most likely lymphatic route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain would involve the lymphatic vessels draining the abdominal and pelvic regions. The lymphatic vessels from these regions drain into the lumbar trunks, which then drain into the cisterna chyli. From the cisterna chyli, the lymphatic flow can take two main routes: either through the thoracic duct or through the bronchomediastinal trunks. The thoracic duct drains into the left subclavian vein, while the bronchomediastinal trunks drain into the right lymphatic duct. Finally, the lymphatic flow enters the systemic circulation through the subclavian veins. Given that the metastases are in the brain, the lymphatic route would involve the right lymphatic duct, which drains into the right subclavian vein. Therefore, the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain is option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
