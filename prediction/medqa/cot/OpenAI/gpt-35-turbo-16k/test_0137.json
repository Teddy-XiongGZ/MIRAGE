    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of tearing, foreign body sensation in the eyes, eyelid retraction, and limited extraocular motility on upgaze. These findings are consistent with Graves' ophthalmopathy, which is an autoimmune condition commonly associated with Graves' disease. The patient also has symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. The laboratory studies reveal a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and an elevated total T4 level, along with a positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin. The CT scan shows proptosis and enlargement of the extraocular muscles. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Graves' ophthalmopathy. The question asks for the treatment that would most likely transiently worsen the patient's eye symptoms. External orbital radiation is a treatment option for Graves' ophthalmopathy, but it is not expected to transiently worsen the symptoms. Selenium supplementation has been studied as a potential treatment for Graves' ophthalmopathy, but it is not expected to transiently worsen the symptoms either. Systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat Graves' ophthalmopathy and can provide symptomatic relief. However, they can also cause transient worsening of the eye symptoms due to the initial inflammatory response. Treatment with radioactive iodine is used to treat hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease, but it is not expected to transiently worsen the eye symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Systemic corticosteroids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
