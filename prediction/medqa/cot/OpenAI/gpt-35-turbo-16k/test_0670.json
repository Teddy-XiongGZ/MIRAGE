    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antiseptic that is commonly used for skin disinfection. To determine its mechanism of action, we need to consider the options provided. A. Bactericidal at low concentrations: Chlorhexidine is indeed bactericidal, but it is effective at both low and high concentrations. Therefore, this option does not fully describe its mechanism of action. B. Cell wall damage by free radical release: This mechanism is more commonly associated with the action of antibiotics like beta-lactams, which target the bacterial cell wall. Chlorhexidine does not act by releasing free radicals to damage the cell wall. C. Attack of free-sulfur amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids within the bacteria: This option describes the mechanism of action of another antiseptic called iodine, not chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine does not directly attack these components within bacteria. D. Its activity depends on pH and is greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter: This is the correct mechanism of action for chlorhexidine. It is most effective in an alkaline pH range and its activity is reduced in the presence of organic matter. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Its activity depends on pH and is greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
