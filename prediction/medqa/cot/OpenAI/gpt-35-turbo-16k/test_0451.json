    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing cramping pain in his calves after walking, which is a symptom of intermittent claudication. Intermittent claudication is commonly caused by peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is characterized by narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the legs. Cilostazol is a medication commonly used to improve symptoms of intermittent claudication. To determine the mechanism of action of cilostazol, we need to consider its pharmacological properties. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, which means it inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors increase the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in cells, leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. This mechanism of action helps improve blood flow and reduce symptoms in patients with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phosphodiesterase inhibitor\"}"
