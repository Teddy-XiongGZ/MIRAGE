    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and recent initiation of warfarin therapy, the most likely diagnosis is warfarin-induced skin necrosis. This is a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy, characterized by painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration. The skin findings in this patient, including large purpura, hemorrhagic bullae, and areas of skin necrosis, are consistent with this diagnosis. The treatment of choice for warfarin-induced skin necrosis is protein C concentrate. Protein C is a natural anticoagulant that is inhibited by warfarin, leading to a procoagulant state. Administration of protein C concentrate can help restore the balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, and improve the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the answer choice is B. Protein C concentrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
