    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 33-year-old woman at 17-weeks gestation with a painless mass in the right breast that has not increased in size. Physical examination reveals a rubbery, mobile mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. The biopsy shows rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are common benign breast tumors that typically occur in young women and are characterized by a rubbery, mobile mass. They are usually painless and do not increase in size during pregnancy. Normal pregnancy-related changes would not present as a distinct mass. Fat necrosis typically presents as a firm, irregular mass that may be tender. Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors that can be benign, borderline, or malignant, and they typically present as a rapidly growing mass. However, the biopsy findings in this case are more consistent with fibroadenoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
