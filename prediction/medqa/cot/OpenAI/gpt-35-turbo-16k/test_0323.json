    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with a condition known as rickets. Rickets is a disorder characterized by impaired mineralization of the growth plate, leading to skeletal deformities. The physical examination findings of frontal bossing, widened wrists, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs are all classic signs of rickets. The erosion of enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars is also a common finding in patients with rickets. The fact that the patient is exclusively breastfed is important because breast milk is low in vitamin D, which is necessary for calcium absorption and bone mineralization. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a deficiency of vitamin D, which is required for the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines. This deficiency can lead to impaired mineralization of the growth plate and the characteristic skeletal deformities seen in rickets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
