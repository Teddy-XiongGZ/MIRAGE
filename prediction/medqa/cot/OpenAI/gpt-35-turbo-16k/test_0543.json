    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's presentation of sharp pain that worsens with deep inspiration and radiates along the right hemithorax, along with the absence of any other symptoms, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be considered. However, it is important to note that this patient is low-risk for pulmonary embolism based on the absence of significant risk factors such as recent surgery, immobilization, or history of deep vein thrombosis. The first step towards ruling out pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient is to perform a D-dimer test. D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that is elevated in the presence of thrombus formation. A negative D-dimer test has a high negative predictive value and can effectively rule out pulmonary embolism in low-risk patients. If the D-dimer test is positive, further imaging studies such as a CT pulmonary angiogram may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. D-dimer\"}"
