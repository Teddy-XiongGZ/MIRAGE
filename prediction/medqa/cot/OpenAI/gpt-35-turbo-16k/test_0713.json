    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, it is likely that he is experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's high blood glucose level, fruity breath odor, positive urine ketones, and metabolic acidosis (low pH, low bicarbonate) support this diagnosis. The immediate management of DKA involves fluid resuscitation and insulin administration. Insulin helps to lower blood glucose levels and suppress ketogenesis. Fluid resuscitation is necessary to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient is to administer IV fluids and insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
