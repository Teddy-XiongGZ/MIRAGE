    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The quadruple screening test measures maternal serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), estriol, and inhibin A. In this case, the patient has an elevated AFP level, but normal levels of hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Elevated AFP levels are associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida and anencephaly. Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is a neural tube defect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
