    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the statistical power of a screening test, we need to consider the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Sensitivity is the ability of the test to correctly identify individuals with the disease, while specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify individuals without the disease. In this case, the sensitivity of the screening test can be calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. So, sensitivity = 45 / (45 + 5) = 0.9. The specificity of the screening test can be calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives. So, specificity = 35 / (35 + 15) = 0.7. The statistical power of a screening test is the probability of correctly identifying individuals with the disease when the disease is truly present. It is influenced by both sensitivity and specificity. Given the sensitivity and specificity values, we can calculate the statistical power of the screening test using the formula: power = sensitivity * (1 - specificity). So, power = 0.9 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.9 * 0.3 = 0.27. Therefore, the correct answer is D. If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
