    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation of rapid breathing and hypoxia in a newborn, along with the findings on chest x-ray of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities, are consistent with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a common condition in premature infants due to surfactant deficiency. The most likely finding on further evaluation would be hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy, as this is a characteristic histologic finding in RDS. Bilateral pleural effusions on lung ultrasound are more commonly seen in conditions such as congestive heart failure or infection. Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture would suggest infection with Treponema pallidum, which is associated with congenital syphilis. Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning may be seen in infants who have passed meconium in utero, but it is not specific to RDS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
