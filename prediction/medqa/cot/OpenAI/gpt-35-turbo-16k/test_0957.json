    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman is Rh-negative, and the father is Rh-positive. This means that there is a possibility that the fetus may be Rh-positive. During pregnancy, there is a risk of fetal-maternal hemorrhage, which can lead to sensitization of the mother's immune system to the Rh antigen. Sensitization can occur during delivery or other procedures that may cause mixing of fetal and maternal blood. Sensitized mothers can develop antibodies against the Rh antigen, which can cross the placenta and cause hemolytic disease of the newborn in subsequent pregnancies. To prevent sensitization, Rh-negative women should receive Rh immune globulin (RhIg) at 28 weeks' gestation and within 72 hours after delivery or any other event that may cause fetal-maternal hemorrhage. RhIg contains anti-D IgG antibodies, which bind to any fetal Rh-positive red blood cells that may have entered the maternal circulation, preventing sensitization. Therefore, the most appropriate administration at this time is Anti-D IgG.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Anti-D IgG\"}"
