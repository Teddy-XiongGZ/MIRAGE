    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is likely that he has sustained a clavicle fracture. The presence of swelling, tenderness, and limited range of motion over the right clavicle, along with pain exacerbated by movement, are consistent with this diagnosis. The intact skin and radial pulse in the right arm suggest that there is no vascular compromise. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder would be to apply a simple shoulder sling (Choice B). This will provide support and immobilization to the fractured clavicle, allowing for healing to occur. Tension banding (Choice A) is not indicated in this case, as it is typically used for the treatment of certain types of fractures, such as olecranon fractures. Obtaining an MRI of the right shoulder (Choice C) is not necessary at this point, as the diagnosis of clavicle fracture can be made based on the clinical presentation and confirmed with an x-ray. Performing arteriography (Choice D) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of vascular compromise in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
