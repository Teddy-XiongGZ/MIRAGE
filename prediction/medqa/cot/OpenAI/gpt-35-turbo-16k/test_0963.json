    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the ejection fraction, we need to know the stroke volume and the end-diastolic volume. The stroke volume is calculated by subtracting the end-systolic volume from the end-diastolic volume. However, the end-diastolic volume is not provided in the question. Therefore, we cannot determine the ejection fraction based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"N/A\"}"
