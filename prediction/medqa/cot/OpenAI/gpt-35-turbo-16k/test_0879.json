    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl who has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months. Her menses had previously occurred at irregular intervals with moderate to heavy flow. She started having sexual intercourse about 3 months ago. Her physical examination is unremarkable, and her urine pregnancy test is negative. The serum hormone studies show normal levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and testosterone. Given these findings, the most likely cause of her symptoms is anovulation. Anovulation refers to the absence of ovulation, which can lead to irregular or absent menstrual periods. It is a common cause of menstrual irregularities in adolescents, especially in the first few years after menarche. Other causes such as uterine fibroids, congenital defects of the Mullerian ducts, and purging behavior are less likely based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
