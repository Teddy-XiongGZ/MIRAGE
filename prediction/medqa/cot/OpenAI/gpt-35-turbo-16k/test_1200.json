    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this case presents with fever, chills, generalized weakness, and a history of intravenous drug use. The presence of track marks on both cubital fossae suggests intravenous drug use. The retinal hemorrhages with pale centers are suggestive of Roth spots, which are associated with infective endocarditis. The grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard best at the lower left sternal border is consistent with tricuspid regurgitation. The transthoracic echocardiography shows multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to start intravenous antibiotic therapy. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Intravenous vancomycin therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
