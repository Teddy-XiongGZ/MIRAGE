    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden-onset right-sided body numbness, which suggests a neurological deficit. The decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body indicates involvement of the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in these areas. The motor strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal, suggesting that the motor pathways are intact. Given the clinical presentation, the most likely site of impairment is the lateral medulla, which is supplied by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The PICA supplies the lateral medulla, including the spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract, which are responsible for sensation in the face and body. Therefore, the answer is B. Lateral medulla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
