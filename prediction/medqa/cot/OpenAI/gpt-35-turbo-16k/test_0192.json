    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The authors conducted a follow-up analysis on their data and stratified the results by CD4+T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. They found that among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk. However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence. This difference observed between the two strata suggests that there is an effect modification. Effect modification occurs when the relationship between an exposure (cART adherence) and an outcome (DLBCL risk) is modified by another variable (CD4+ cell count). In this case, the CD4+ cell count is modifying the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk, leading to different results in the two strata.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Effect modification\"}"
