    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presentation of severe sunburns and irritation of the corneas suggests a problem with the patient's ability to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. UV radiation induces the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which are typically repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER is the primary mechanism for repairing UV-induced DNA damage. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is involved in repairing double-strand breaks in DNA, while homologous recombination is involved in repairing double-strand breaks during DNA replication. Mismatch repair is responsible for correcting errors that occur during DNA replication. Given the specific presentation and the role of NER in repairing UV-induced DNA damage, the likely impaired process in this patient is nucleotide excision repair (A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
