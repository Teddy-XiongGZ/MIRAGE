    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a rapidly increasing right breast mass. The mass is nontender and multinodular. There are no changes in the skin or nipple. Mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy of the mass shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a phyllodes tumor. Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial tumors that can rapidly increase in size. They are typically nontender and can have multinodular features. Mammography may show a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy findings of papillary projections with hyperplasia and atypia are consistent with a phyllodes tumor. Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors and are typically well-circumscribed and mobile. Fibrocystic disease of the breast is a benign condition characterized by fibrosis and cyst formation. Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that typically presents as a firm, non-tender mass with skin or nipple changes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Phyllodes tumor\"}"
