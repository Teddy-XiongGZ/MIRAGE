    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of progressively worsening hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech in background noise, constant ear ringing, and episodes of unsteadiness, along with the physical examination findings of normal outer ears and unremarkable otoscopic findings, the most likely site of impairment is the inner ear. The Weber test result, where the vibrating tuning fork is heard equally on both ears when placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, suggests that there is no significant asymmetry in hearing between the two ears. The Rinne test result, where air conduction is greater than bone conduction when the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, indicates that there is a sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, the most likely structure impaired in this patient is the cochlea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Cochlea\"}"
