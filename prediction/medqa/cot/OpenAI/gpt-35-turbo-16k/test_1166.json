Social anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fear and anxiety in social situations, leading to avoidance of such situations. The patient's fear of being judged by others, avoidance of speaking in class, and spending breaks in the restroom are all consistent with social anxiety disorder. Pharmacotherapy is one of the treatment options for social anxiety disorder. Among the given choices, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Choice C), are considered first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder. Clomipramine (Choice A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that may be used for obsessive-compulsive disorder, but it is not the first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder. Phenelzine (Choice B) is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that may be used for social anxiety disorder, but it is not the first-line treatment and has more side effects compared to SSRIs. Propranolol (Choice D) is a beta-blocker that may be used to manage the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heart rate and flushing, but it does not address the underlying anxiety disorder. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition is fluoxetine (Choice C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
