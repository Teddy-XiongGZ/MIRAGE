    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 27-year-old woman in active labor at 40 weeks' gestation. She has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and is currently on insulin. She presents with severe pelvic pain, which improves after epidural anesthesia. However, 10 minutes later, she develops dizziness and hypotension. Given the clinical scenario, the most likely underlying cause of her hypotension is aortocaval compression. Aortocaval compression occurs when the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta, leading to decreased venous return and subsequent hypotension. This is a common cause of hypotension in pregnant women, especially when lying supine. The patient's symptoms improved after epidural anesthesia, which suggests that sympathetic block is not the cause of her hypotension. Hypovolemia and acute pulmonary hypertension are less likely causes in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
