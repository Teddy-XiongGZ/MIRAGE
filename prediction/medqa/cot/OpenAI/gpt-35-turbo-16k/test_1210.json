    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus), which is a sign of jaundice. Jaundice occurs when there is an accumulation of bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced when red blood cells are broken down. It is normally processed by the liver and excreted in the bile. Option A, autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of the biliary tract, is unlikely in this patient as there are no other signs or symptoms of autoimmune disease mentioned in the question stem. Option B, chronic viral infection of the liver, is also unlikely as there are no risk factors or symptoms suggestive of a chronic viral infection. Option C, decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, is a possible explanation for the patient's symptoms. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase is an enzyme involved in the conjugation of bilirubin, which is necessary for its excretion. If there is decreased activity of this enzyme, bilirubin may accumulate in the body and lead to jaundice. However, there is no mention of any underlying condition or medication that could cause this enzyme deficiency. Option D, defective bilirubin excretion, is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms. The fact that the patient has a history of a similar episode 4 years ago suggests a recurring problem. Additionally, the recent episode of binge drinking may have contributed to liver dysfunction and impaired bilirubin excretion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
