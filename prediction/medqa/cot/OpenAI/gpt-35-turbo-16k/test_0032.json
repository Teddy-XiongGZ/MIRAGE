The laboratory findings of low hemoglobin, low leukocyte count, and low platelet count indicate pancytopenia, which can be seen in certain infections. The blood cultures growing coagulase-negative staphylococci suggest a possible staphylococcal infection. Considering the patient's recent hospitalization and exposure to antibiotics, it is important to choose an antibiotic that covers coagulase-negative staphylococci. Among the given choices, Linezolid is the most appropriate antibiotic for treating coagulase-negative staphylococci.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Linezolid\"}"
