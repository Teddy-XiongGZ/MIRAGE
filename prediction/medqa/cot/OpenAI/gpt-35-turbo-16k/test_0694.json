These findings are suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, which is commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear, and positive heterophile antibody screen further support this diagnosis. The best management for infectious mononucleosis is supportive care, including bed rest and activity limitation to prevent complications such as splenic rupture. Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication used for the treatment of certain viral infections, but it is not indicated for the management of infectious mononucleosis. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic commonly used for the treatment of bacterial infections, but it is not effective against viral infections such as infectious mononucleosis. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that may be used in some cases of severe or complicated infectious mononucleosis, but it is not the first-line management for this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
