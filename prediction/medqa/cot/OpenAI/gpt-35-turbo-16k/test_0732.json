    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressive neck pain, headaches, and numbness in both hands. He also has a history of intermittent lower back pain that improves with movement. These symptoms, along with the presence of track marks on both forearms, suggest a possible infectious etiology. The patient's history of intravenous drug use further supports this suspicion. The laboratory findings show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is indicative of inflammation. The MRI of the spine also shows signs of inflammation. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a bone biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. This will help identify the specific infectious organism and guide further treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
