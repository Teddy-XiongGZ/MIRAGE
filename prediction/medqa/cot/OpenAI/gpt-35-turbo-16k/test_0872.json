    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The splenic artery is a branch of the celiac trunk. Ligating the splenic artery at its origin will result in decreased blood flow to the organs supplied by this artery. The left gastric artery, gastroduodenal artery, and left gastroepiploic artery are all branches of the celiac trunk, so they will not be affected by ligating the splenic artery. The common hepatic artery is also a branch of the celiac trunk, but it does not supply the spleen. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Common hepatic artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
