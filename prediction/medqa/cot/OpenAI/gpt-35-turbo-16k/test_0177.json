    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees. The patient's bilateral knee pain, morning stiffness, and crepitus on passive range of motion are consistent with osteoarthritis. The presence of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints, known as Heberden's nodes, is also characteristic of osteoarthritis. Gout typically presents with sudden onset of severe joint pain, usually affecting the big toe. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, and it is less likely in this patient given the absence of back pain and other characteristic symptoms. Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. However, the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are more consistent with osteoarthritis than fibromyalgia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
