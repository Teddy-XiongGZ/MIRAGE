    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of intermittent stabbing face pain, triggered by touch and brushing her teeth, along with the presence of decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally, suggest a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia. The weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week, along with the spasticity of the lower extremities and sustained clonus, indicate an upper motor neuron lesion. The combination of trigeminal neuralgia and upper motor neuron signs suggests a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, further evaluation is most likely going to reveal multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
