    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Drug X is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). CDK4 is responsible for phosphorylating and inactivating the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. The Rb protein normally acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the progression of the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase. When Rb is phosphorylated and inactivated by CDK4, it releases its inhibition on the cell cycle, allowing the cell to progress from G1 phase to S phase. Therefore, the most likely result of drug X's action on the Rb gene is the initiation of S phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
