    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the case of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the alveolar lining is damaged. The regeneration of the alveolar lining involves the replacement of damaged cells with healthy cells. The cells responsible for secreting surfactant, a substance that helps reduce surface tension in the alveoli, are known as type II pneumocytes. These cells play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and function of the alveoli. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
