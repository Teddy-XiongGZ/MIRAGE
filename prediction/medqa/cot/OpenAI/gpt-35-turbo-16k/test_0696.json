    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this patient, the physician has diagnosed her as pre-diabetic based on her fasting blood glucose level and two-hour post glucose load blood glucose level. Pre-diabetes is characterized by impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. To increase insulin sensitivity in this patient, we need to identify the endogenous signaling molecule or receptor that can enhance insulin action. Insulin sensitivity is increased by the activation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). PPAR-gamma is a nuclear receptor that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. It is involved in adipocyte differentiation and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral tissues. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
