    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of multiple pregnancy losses in the second trimester, the most likely cause is a structural abnormality of the uterus. The finding of a firm, asymmetric uterus on exam further supports this. To confirm the diagnosis, the most appropriate test would be a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), which is a radiologic procedure that can evaluate the shape and structure of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Karotyping (choice A) is typically done to evaluate for chromosomal abnormalities, but this would be less likely to be the cause in this patient given the recurrent second trimester losses. Prolactin level (choice C) and TSH level (choice D) are hormone tests that may be useful in evaluating for endocrine causes of infertility, but they would not be the most likely cause in this patient with a history of second trimester losses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
