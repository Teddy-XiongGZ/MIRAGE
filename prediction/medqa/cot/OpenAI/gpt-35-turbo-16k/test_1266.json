    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with poorly controlled hypertension and is already taking enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. The physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication, which suggests that the patient's blood pressure is not adequately controlled with enalapril alone. The patient then develops new onset lower extremity swelling, which is a common side effect of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) like verapamil, nifedipine, and amlodipine. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker and does not typically cause lower extremity swelling. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and can cause fluid loss, which would not explain the new onset swelling. Therefore, the most likely medication prescribed to this patient is a calcium channel blocker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Nifedipine\"}"
