    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 36-year-old man who was involved in a high-speed motor-vehicle collision. He has multiple injuries including facial laceration, decreased breath sounds over the right lung base, tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall, swelling of the right elbow and wrist, and shorter right lower extremity. These findings suggest multiple injuries including possible head and neck trauma, chest trauma, and extremity fractures. Given the patient's altered mental status and decreased respiratory rate, the most immediate concern is his airway and breathing. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be intubation and mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
