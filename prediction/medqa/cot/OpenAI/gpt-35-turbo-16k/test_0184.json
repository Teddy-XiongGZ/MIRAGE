    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 78-year-old man presenting with increasing forgetfulness, inability to perform daily activities, leaving doors open and water running, poor sleep, decreased social interaction, and impaired memory. These symptoms are suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder, most likely Alzheimer's disease. The patient's vital signs are normal, ruling out any acute medical condition. The normal serum electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 levels suggest that the symptoms are not due to any metabolic or nutritional deficiency. The blunted affect and psychomotor retardation further support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The most appropriate treatment for Alzheimer's disease is a medication that can help slow down the progression of the disease and improve cognitive function. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.
