    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation therapy works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, which leads to their death. This is achieved through the induction of breaks in double-stranded DNA. Thymidine dimers are formed due to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, not external beam radiation. Disulfide bonds are not directly related to the effects of radiation on cancer cells. Deamination of cytosine is a process that can occur spontaneously or due to the action of specific enzymes, but it is not a direct effect of radiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
