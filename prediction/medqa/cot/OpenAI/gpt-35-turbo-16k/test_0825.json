    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are benign breast masses that commonly occur in young women. They are usually round, mobile, and painless. The fact that the mass became tender just preceding the patient's last 2 menses suggests that it is hormonally responsive. The absence of skin changes, discharge, or axillary lymphadenopathy further supports the diagnosis of a benign mass. Given the patient's age and the absence of other risk factors, such as a family history of breast cancer or genetic mutations, the risk of breast cancer is low. Therefore, the most likely outcome of this patient's condition is that the mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
