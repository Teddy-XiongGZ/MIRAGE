    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The elevated levels of ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular injury. The pattern of liver enzyme elevation can help determine the location of liver cell injury. In this case, the patient's ALT and AST levels are significantly elevated, suggesting hepatocellular injury. The fact that the ALT and AST levels are much higher than the alkaline phosphatase level suggests that the injury is not in the biliary system. The ALT and AST levels are also much higher than the bilirubin level, indicating that the injury is not in the hepatocytes involved in bilirubin metabolism. The centrilobular hepatocytes are located in the central vein area of the liver lobule and are the first cells to be affected by ischemia or toxic injury. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. Centrilobular hepatocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
