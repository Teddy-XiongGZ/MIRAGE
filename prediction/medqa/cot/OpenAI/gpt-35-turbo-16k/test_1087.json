    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with syncope and increasing shortness of breath while exercising, which suggests a cardiac etiology. The vital signs are within normal limits. The cardiac examination reveals a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses during systole. These findings are most consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, which can cause outflow obstruction and result in a harsh systolic ejection murmur. The murmur is accentuated by maneuvers that decrease left ventricular volume, such as forceful expiration against a closed airway. The 2 closely spaced pulses during systole are known as bisferiens pulses and are characteristic of HCM. Aortic stenosis can also cause a systolic ejection murmur, but it is typically heard best at the right upper sternal border and does not cause bisferiens pulses. Cardiac tamponade can cause muffled heart sounds and pulsus paradoxus, but it does not cause a systolic ejection murmur. Third-degree heart block can cause bradycardia and a wide pulse pressure, but it does not cause a systolic ejection murmur or bisferiens pulses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\"}"
