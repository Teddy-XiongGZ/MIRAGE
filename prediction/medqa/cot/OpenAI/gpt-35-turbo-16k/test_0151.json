    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid suggests a molar pregnancy. Molar pregnancies are characterized by the abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue, which can mimic the appearance of a fetus on ultrasound. The enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content are consistent with theca lutein cysts. Theca lutein cysts are associated with high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is commonly elevated in molar pregnancies. Therefore, the most likely cause of the ovarian findings in this case is D. Theca lutein cysts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
