    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 76-year-old man with low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. The pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He also has a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months, along with weight loss, constipation, and difficulty urinating. The neurologic examination shows weakness of the lower extremities, hyperreflexive deep tendon reflexes, bilateral Babinski sign, and decreased sensation below the T4 dermatome. The x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities in both lungs.
