    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has suffered a Grade V splenic laceration, which is a severe injury to the spleen. Splenectomy, the surgical removal of the spleen, is the treatment of choice for such injuries. The spleen plays an important role in the immune system, particularly in fighting against encapsulated bacteria. Therefore, patients who undergo splenectomy are at increased risk of developing infections caused by these bacteria. The vaccines recommended for patients who have undergone splenectomy include: (I) H. influenzae, (II) Tetanus, (III) N. meningitidis, (IV) S. pneumoniae, and (V) Hepatitis B. Based on this information, the patient should receive vaccines (I) H. influenzae, (II) Tetanus, (III) N. meningitidis, (IV) S. pneumoniae, and (V) Hepatitis B. Therefore, the correct answer is B. I, III, IV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
