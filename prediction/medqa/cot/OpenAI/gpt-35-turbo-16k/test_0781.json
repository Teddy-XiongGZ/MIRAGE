    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To detect HIF-1\u03b1 in RCC under normoxic conditions, the researcher should use a technique that can detect protein expression. Northern blot is used to detect RNA expression, so it is not suitable for this experiment. Southern blot is used to detect DNA sequences, so it is also not suitable. Western blot is commonly used to detect protein expression, so it is the most appropriate technique for this experiment. Therefore, the correct answer is D. A Western blot will show increased HIF-1\u03b1 compared to a normoxic control.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
