    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of increasing shortness of breath with exertion, along with the presence of a diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is Aortic regurgitation. The presence of bounding pulses at the radial arteries also supports this diagnosis. Mitral regurgitation typically presents with a holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex, while aortic stenosis presents with a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. Mitral prolapse is characterized by a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Aortic regurgitation\"}"
