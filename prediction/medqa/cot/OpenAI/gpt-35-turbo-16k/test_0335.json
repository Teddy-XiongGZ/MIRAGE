    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sudden loss of consciousness in a young individual without a history of injury suggests a cardiac cause. The presence of a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse suggests increased right atrial pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy. The presence of an S4 suggests impaired ventricular compliance. These findings are consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by impaired ventricular filling due to increased ventricular stiffness. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is unlikely in this case as there are no audible murmurs. Aortic stenosis typically presents with a systolic murmur. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction and is not associated with the findings described in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Restrictive cardiomyopathy\"}"
