    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is Rh(D) negative, and her last pregnancy resulted in a healthy Rh(D) positive baby. This puts her at risk for developing Rh(D) isoimmunization, which occurs when an Rh(D) negative mother is exposed to Rh(D) positive fetal blood. The most common cause of exposure is during delivery, but it can also occur during other procedures such as amniocentesis or trauma. The presence of anti-D antibodies in the mother's blood can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn in subsequent pregnancies. To prevent this, Rh(D) negative mothers are given anti-D immunoglobulin (Rhogam) to prevent the formation of anti-D antibodies. The best next step in management for this patient is to repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks and administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive. This will help prevent isoimmunization and subsequent hemolytic disease of the newborn.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
