    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin, along with clear liquid discharge from the nose and sneezing. These symptoms suggest an allergic reaction. The fact that the symptoms started 30 minutes after eating seafood and that the patient has had similar symptoms in the past further supports an allergic reaction. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for allergic reactions is an antihistamine. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that can effectively relieve symptoms of allergic reactions. Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine that is also effective for allergic reactions, but it is less sedating compared to diphenhydramine. Vitamin K is not indicated for allergic reactions. Calamine lotion is a topical treatment for itching and can provide some relief, but it is not the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Diphenhydramine\"}"
