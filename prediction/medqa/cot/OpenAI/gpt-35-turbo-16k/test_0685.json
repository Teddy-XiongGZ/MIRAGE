    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dotted line in the graph corresponds to the lung volume at a specific transpulmonary pressure. To determine which lung volume it represents, we need to understand the definitions of the potential choices. \\n\\nA. Inspiratory capacity is the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled after a normal exhalation. \\nB. Tidal volume is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled during normal breathing. \\nC. Functional residual capacity is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal exhalation. \\nD. Total lung capacity is the maximum volume of air the lungs can hold. \\n\\nBased on the definitions, the dotted line in the graph most likely corresponds to the Functional residual capacity, as it represents the lung volume at a specific transpulmonary pressure after a normal exhalation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Functional residual capacity\"}"
