    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been brought to her primary care doctor by her son due to concerns about her ability to manage her activities of daily living. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has noticed changes in her behavior, such as stopping attending her wine club meetings and her house becoming more disorganized. She also reports worsening balance and occasional episodes of getting lost when navigating new areas. She has increased urinary urgency and has had episodes of incontinence. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day and was started on multiple medications for anxiety 1 month ago. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not recognize her doctor, becomes somnolent intermittently, and has impaired memory recall. She also has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that worsens with deliberate movement. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is C. Lewy body dementia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
