    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-week-old male who presents with regurgitation of breastmilk through his nose and mouth after feeds. He is otherwise well and has normal growth parameters. The regurgitation seems to be mild and does not cause significant distress to the patient. The mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which has reduced the frequency of regurgitation. There are no other concerning symptoms such as diarrhea or hematochezia. The physical exam is unremarkable. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is physiologic gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Physiologic GER is common in infants and usually resolves on its own by 12-18 months of age. The best next step in management would be reassurance and counseling on positioning. This can include advising the mother to keep the baby upright for 30 minutes after feeds, avoiding overfeeding, and ensuring proper burping techniques. Initiating a proton pump inhibitor or obtaining an abdominal ultrasound would not be indicated at this time as the patient's symptoms are mild and there are no concerning findings on physical exam. Recommending modification of the mother's diet would also not be necessary as there are no signs of food allergies or intolerances.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
