    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 60-year-old woman with severe vulvar itching that has been gradually worsening for the past year. She has tried over-the-counter lubricants without relief. She also reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. On physical examination, there are dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted and the perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. These findings are consistent with lichen sclerosus, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that primarily affects the anogenital area. Lichen sclerosus commonly presents with severe vulvar itching, pain during intercourse, and characteristic physical examination findings such as white plaque-like lesions and atrophy of the labia minora. Squamous cell hyperplasia is not a recognized diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva typically presents as a vulvar mass or ulceration, not as white plaque-like lesions. Lichen planus can also affect the vulva, but it typically presents with purple, polygonal, pruritic papules and plaques, not white plaque-like lesions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lichen sclerosus\"}"
