    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 65-year-old female with a complaint of blurry vision. The fundoscopic examination reveals narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms. These findings are consistent with diabetic retinopathy, which is a complication of long-standing diabetes. The narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms are caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina. In diabetes, high blood sugar levels can lead to the accumulation of sorbitol in the cells. Sorbitol is produced from glucose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. The accumulation of sorbitol can cause damage to the blood vessels, including those in the retina. Therefore, the likely enzyme involved in this patient's symptoms is sorbitol dehydrogenase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
