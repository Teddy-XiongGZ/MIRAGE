    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with vomiting bright red blood and black, tarry stools, which are indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The physical examination findings of splenomegaly and positive fluid wave suggest portal hypertension. The bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus is consistent with esophageal varices, which are a complication of portal hypertension. The patient has been stabilized with intravenous fluids and her blood pressure has improved. The next step in management is to prevent rebleeding from the esophageal varices. The pharmacologic agent indicated for this purpose is nadolol, a nonselective beta-blocker that reduces portal pressure and decreases the risk of variceal bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Nadalol\"}"
