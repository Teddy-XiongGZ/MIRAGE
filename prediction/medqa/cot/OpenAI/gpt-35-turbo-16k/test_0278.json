    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with shortness of breath, which is a symptom of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of COPD and a significant smoking history, which puts him at risk for exacerbations and respiratory failure. The physical exam findings of bilateral wheezes and poor air movement suggest that the patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 80% on room air, despite being on 100% oxygen. This indicates severe hypoxemia. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the lack of improvement with initial treatment, the best next step in management would be to intubate the patient to provide mechanical ventilation and improve oxygenation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
