    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn in this case has multiple physical findings that are consistent with a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a deletion on chromosome 22q11.2. The characteristic features of DiGeorge syndrome include micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, small, low-set ears, and a cleft palate. The presence of a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur and a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart are also consistent with the cardiac abnormalities commonly seen in DiGeorge syndrome. Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion, which can be detected using FISH studies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
