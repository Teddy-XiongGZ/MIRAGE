    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is likely that he has a lipoma. Lipomas are benign tumors composed of mature adipose tissue. However, in this case, the histopathological examination revealed a liposarcoma, which is a malignant tumor of adipose tissue. Liposarcomas are characterized by the presence of abnormal adipocytes with increased cellularity and atypical features. One of the key differences between lipomas and liposarcomas is the presence of increased cell proliferation and altered cell cycle regulation in liposarcomas. Telomerase is an enzyme that plays a role in maintaining telomere length and is commonly upregulated in cancer cells to promote cell immortalization and proliferation. Therefore, the most likely enzyme to show increased activity in the cells of this patient's tumor is D. Telomerase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
