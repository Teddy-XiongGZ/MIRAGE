    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with periorbital edema and lower extremity edema, which are signs of fluid retention. The kidney biopsy showing effacement of the podocytes suggests a glomerular disease. The most likely diagnosis in this case is minimal change disease, which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. In minimal change disease, the urinalysis typically shows massive proteinuria (>3.5 g/day) with few or no red blood cells or white blood cells. Therefore, the most likely finding on urinalysis would be albumin, indicating proteinuria. The presence of fatty casts, hyaline casts, white blood cell casts, eosinophils, granular casts, or tubular epithelial cells would not be consistent with minimal change disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fatty casts and albumin\"}"
