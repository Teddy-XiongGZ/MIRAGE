    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 81-year-old man with memory issues that have progressively worsened over the last several years. He also had an acute worsening of symptoms recently. Additionally, he had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. On examination, he has hemiparesis, reduced muscle tone, and exaggerated reflexes on the right side. These findings suggest a vascular etiology.
