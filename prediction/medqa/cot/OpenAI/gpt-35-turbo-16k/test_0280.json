The fear of flying has significantly impacted his personal and professional life. The patient recognizes that his fear is irrational, indicating that he has insight into his condition. Medications like alprazolam (A) and fluoxetine (C) may help alleviate symptoms of anxiety, but they do not address the underlying fear and avoidance behavior. Psychodynamic psychotherapy (D) focuses on exploring unconscious conflicts and may not be the most effective treatment for a specific phobia.

It can help the patient gradually confront and overcome his fear through exposure therapy and relaxation techniques.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
