    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of central chest pain that is sharp, severe, worsens with lying down, and improves with leaning forward, along with radiation to the shoulders and neck, the most likely diagnosis is acute pericarditis. The scratching sound heard on physical exam, known as a pericardial friction rub, further supports this diagnosis. The ECG shows diffuse ST segment elevations and PR depressions, which are classic findings in acute pericarditis. The patient's vital signs are stable, indicating that he is not in immediate danger. The optimal therapy for acute pericarditis is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, along with colchicine to reduce the risk of recurrence. Omeprazole may be added to protect the stomach from NSAID-induced gastritis. Pericardiocentesis is not indicated in this patient as he does not have signs of cardiac tamponade, such as hypotension or pulsus paradoxus. Pericardiectomy is a surgical option for chronic or recurrent pericarditis that does not respond to medical therapy, but it is not the first-line treatment for acute pericarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole\"}"
