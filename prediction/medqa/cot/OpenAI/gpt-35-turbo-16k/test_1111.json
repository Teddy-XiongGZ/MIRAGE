    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, including episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash, along with the positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies, are suggestive of celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an immune response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The most characteristic histological finding in celiac disease is villous atrophy, which refers to the flattening of the villi in the small intestine. This leads to a decrease in the absorptive surface area and subsequent malabsorption. Crypt hypertrophy, or an increase in the size of the crypts, is also commonly seen in celiac disease. Therefore, the most likely change to be seen on intestinal biopsy in this patient would be villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
