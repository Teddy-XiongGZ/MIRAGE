    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in two isolates of Hemophilus influenzae type B: an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate. Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator then cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Based on this information, the most likely process responsible for the described findings is transformation. Transformation is the process by which bacteria take up DNA from their environment and incorporate it into their own genome. In this case, the noninfectious isolate is being exposed to lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate, which likely contains DNA that can be taken up by the noninfectious isolate. This DNA may contain genes or factors that allow the noninfectious isolate to become infectious and cause symptoms in the animals exposed to it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
