    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to find the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). ARR is calculated by subtracting the control group event rate from the treatment group event rate. In this case, the event rate is the proportion of participants cured in each group. The control group event rate is 165/250 = 0.66, and the treatment group event rate is 190/250 = 0.76. Therefore, the ARR is 0.76 - 0.66 = 0.1. Taking the reciprocal of the ARR gives us the NNT, which is 1/0.1 = 10.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 250/25\"}"
