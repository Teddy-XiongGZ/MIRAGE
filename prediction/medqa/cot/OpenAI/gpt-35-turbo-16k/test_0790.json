    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To maintain a steady state, the amount of drug eliminated from the body must be equal to the amount of drug administered. The formula for steady-state concentration is: Css = (Dose / Clearance) x Bioavailability. Given that the target plasma concentration (Css) is 2 mg/L, the clearance is 15.0 L/h, and the bioavailability is 75%, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the dose. Dose = (Css x Clearance) / Bioavailability. Plugging in the values, we get Dose = (2 mg/L x 15.0 L/h) / 0.75 = 40 mg/h. Since the drug is administered twice per day, the dosage at each dosing interval would be half of the total daily dose. Therefore, the answer is 40 mg/h / 2 = 20 mg/h.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 240 mg\"}"
