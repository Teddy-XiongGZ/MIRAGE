    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of fatigue, anhedonia, psychomotor retardation, and insomnia, which are consistent with a major depressive episode. The fact that the patient's symptoms have not improved after 1 week of appropriate first-line therapy suggests that the current treatment may not be effective. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to change the treatment regimen. Option B, Change treatment to lithium, would be the most appropriate choice as lithium is a commonly used mood stabilizer that can be effective in treating depression. Options A and D, Add lithium to treatment regimen and Electroconvulsive therapy, respectively, are not the best choices at this point as they are more invasive interventions that are typically reserved for treatment-resistant depression. Option C, Continue current therapy, would not be the best choice as the patient's symptoms have not improved with the current therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
