    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Inadequate maternal iodine intake is a common cause of congenital hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is essential for normal growth and development, so a deficiency can lead to various signs and symptoms. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one would NOT be expected in a child with congenital hypothyroidism:\\n\\nA. Hypotonia: Hypotonia, or decreased muscle tone, is a common finding in children with congenital hypothyroidism. This is because thyroid hormone plays a role in muscle development and function. Therefore, hypotonia would be expected in this child.\\n\\nB. Diarrhea: Diarrhea is not typically associated with congenital hypothyroidism. It is more commonly seen in conditions such as gastroenteritis or malabsorption disorders. Therefore, diarrhea would NOT be expected in this child.\\n\\nC. Umbilical hernia: Umbilical hernia is a common finding in infants and is not specific to congenital hypothyroidism. It is caused by a weakness in the abdominal wall around the umbilical cord. Therefore, umbilical hernia could be observed in this child.\\n\\nD. Macroglossia: Macroglossia, or an enlarged tongue, is a characteristic feature of congenital hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is necessary for normal tongue development, so a deficiency can lead to an enlarged tongue. Therefore, macroglossia would be expected in this child.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the sign and symptom that would NOT be expected to be observed in this child with congenital hypothyroidism is B. Diarrhea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
