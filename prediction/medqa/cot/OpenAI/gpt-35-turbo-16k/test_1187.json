    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing muscle rigidity, profuse diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension, which are consistent with malignant hyperthermia (MH). MH is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur during general anesthesia or in the postoperative period. It is most commonly triggered by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine. In this case, the patient's symptoms developed just after the appendiceal base was ligated, suggesting that the trigger was likely succinylcholine. The most appropriate treatment for MH is dantrolene, which acts by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and reducing intracellular calcium concentrations. Dantrolene is the only medication listed among the answer choices that is used to treat MH. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Dantrolene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
