    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with fatigue and dizziness, which could be indicative of anemia. The laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL, which supports the presence of anemia. The leukocyte count is elevated at 11,500/mm^3, with a predominance of lymphocytes. The flow cytometry test demonstrates CD20+ cells. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In CLL, the bone marrow is infiltrated with abnormal lymphocytes, leading to anemia and lymphocytosis. The presence of CD20+ cells is consistent with CLL. Smudge cells are fragile lymphocytes that rupture during the slide preparation, and their presence is characteristic of CLL. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be the presence of smudge cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
