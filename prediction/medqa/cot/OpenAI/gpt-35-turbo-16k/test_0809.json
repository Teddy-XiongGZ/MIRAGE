    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the clinical presentation of sudden onset severe pain, redness, swelling, and warmth in the right knee, along with systemic symptoms such as fever and increased inflammatory markers (CRP and procalcitonin), the most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is an infection of the joint that can cause significant pain and inflammation. Analysis of synovial fluid is an important diagnostic tool in evaluating joint infections. In septic arthritis, the synovial fluid analysis typically shows a high white blood cell count (WBC), predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), and low viscosity due to the presence of inflammatory cells and fluid accumulation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
