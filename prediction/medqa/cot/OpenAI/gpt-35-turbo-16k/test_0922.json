    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. These findings suggest an underlying immunodeficiency disorder. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date, which makes primary immunodeficiency disorders more likely. The patient's appearance of being ill, along with the presence of pus-secreting lesions, suggests a severe immunodeficiency. Among the given options, the most likely diagnosis is Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which is characterized by recurrent infections, eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immunodeficiency. Chronic granulomatous disease is characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, but does not typically present with skin lesions. Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition characterized by pruritic, erythematous, and scaly skin lesions, but it does not typically present with recurrent infections or lymphadenopathy. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent pyogenic infections, partial albinism, and peripheral neuropathy, but it does not typically present with recurrent fevers or lymphadenopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome\"}"
