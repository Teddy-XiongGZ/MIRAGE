    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of a grayish-white pseudomembrane in the oropharynx, along with marked enlargement of cervical lymph nodes, is suggestive of a bacterial infection. Option A, yeast with pseudohyphae, is not consistent with the clinical presentation. Option C, gram-positive cocci with hyaluronic acid capsule, is not associated with the characteristic pseudomembrane. Option D, gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease, is also not consistent with the presentation. Therefore, the most likely organism responsible for this patient's disease is option B, gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation. This is consistent with the clinical features of diphtheria, which is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a gram-positive bacterium that produces an exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
