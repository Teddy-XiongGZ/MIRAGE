    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-week-old female newborn with increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. Her stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but recently switched to formula feeds. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Serum studies show elevated direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase levels. The most likely diagnosis in this patient is biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is a rare condition characterized by the absence or obstruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to bile stasis, liver damage, and jaundice. It typically presents in the first few weeks of life with jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly. The diagnosis is confirmed by imaging studies such as ultrasonography or hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, leading to the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate. It presents in the first few days of life with vomiting, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, and jaundice. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the deficiency of the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, leading to the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin. It presents in the first few days of life with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and can cause kernicterus if left untreated. Breast milk jaundice is a benign condition that occurs in some breastfed infants due to an increased concentration of \u03b2-glucuronidase in breast milk, which leads to increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. It typically presents after the first week of life and resolves spontaneously without treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Biliary atresia\"}"
