    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia. It works by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain. When considering the potential adverse effects of risperidone, it is important to consider the mechanism of action and the patient population. Agranulocytosis is a rare but serious adverse effect associated with some antipsychotic medications, but it is not specifically associated with risperidone. Shortened QT interval is not a known adverse effect of risperidone. Gynecomastia, or the development of breast tissue in males, is a potential adverse effect of risperidone due to its ability to increase prolactin levels. Weight gain, rather than weight loss, is a common adverse effect of risperidone. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Gynecomastia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
