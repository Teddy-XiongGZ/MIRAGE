    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this scenario is a young male who was involved in a motor vehicle crash and was ejected from the vehicle. He presents with a low GCS score, indicating a significant head injury. He also has multiple ecchymoses, petechiae, and purpura, which are signs of bleeding under the skin. The laceration over his clavicle continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage, and he oozes from the sites of venepuncture. These findings suggest a problem with coagulation. The labs reveal a low platelet count, prolongation of the PT and aPTT, and a low hemoglobin level. These findings are consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a condition characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation system and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. DIC can occur as a result of severe trauma, such as in this patient's case. Therefore, the best diagnosis for this patient's presentation is C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
