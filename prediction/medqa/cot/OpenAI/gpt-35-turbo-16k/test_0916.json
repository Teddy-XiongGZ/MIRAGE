    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden onset substernal chest pain, which is a typical symptom of acute coronary syndrome. The fact that the pain resolved within 15 minutes and the repeat ECG showed no abnormalities suggests a transient ischemic event. Given the patient's risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) and the presence of ST-segment elevations on the initial ECG, the most likely underlying mechanism is atherosclerotic plaque rupture, leading to partial occlusion of a coronary artery and subsequent myocardial ischemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
