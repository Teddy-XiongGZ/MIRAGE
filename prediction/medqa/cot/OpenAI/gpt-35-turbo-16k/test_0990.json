    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, resulting in functional obstruction. The patient's symptoms of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting, along with the greenish vomitus and strange smell, are consistent with bowel obstruction. The patient's failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life and subsequent infrequent bowel movements suggest a possible diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. The physical examination findings of small, low-set ears, broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally are consistent with Down syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of Hirschsprung disease. The distended abdomen and explosive release of stool following rectal exam further support the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. To confirm the diagnosis, a rectal suction biopsy is the most appropriate test. This procedure involves obtaining a small tissue sample from the rectum to evaluate for the absence of ganglion cells. The absence of ganglion cells in the biopsy specimen would confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Rectal suction biopsy\"}"
