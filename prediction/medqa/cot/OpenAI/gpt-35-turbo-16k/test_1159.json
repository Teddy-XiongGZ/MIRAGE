    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen, along with the recent history of appendectomy for an abscess, it is likely that the patient has developed postoperative peritonitis. The presence of a gram-negative pathogen on anaerobic culture suggests a polymicrobial infection. Among the choices provided, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is Clostridium perfringens. This bacterium is a common cause of postoperative peritonitis and is associated with gas gangrene and necrotizing infections. Bacteroides fragilis is also a common cause of polymicrobial infections, but it is less likely in this case as the patient's symptoms and recent surgery point towards Clostridium perfringens. Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella sonnei are not typically associated with postoperative peritonitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Clostridium perfringens\"}"
