    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the description provided, the patient has a painless right-sided scrotal swelling that is soft, cystic, and transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. These findings are consistent with a hydrocele, which is an accumulation of fluid within the tunica vaginalis.
