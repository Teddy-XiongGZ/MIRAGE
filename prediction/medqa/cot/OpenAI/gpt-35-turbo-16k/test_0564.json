    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing sexual dysfunction as a side effect of citalopram, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of SSRIs. The appropriate step in the management of this patient is to consider switching to a different antidepressant that is less likely to cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that does not typically cause sexual dysfunction and may even improve sexual function. Fluoxetine is another SSRI and is therefore not likely to resolve the patient's sexual dysfunction. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and is not typically used as a first-line treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is B. Addition of bupropion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
