    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history, he has experienced multiple month-long episodes of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. This is consistent with symptoms of depression. Additionally, he has also experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy, during which he engaged in impulsive behavior (spending money without asking). This is consistent with symptoms of mania. The presence of both depressive and manic episodes suggests a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. However, the patient's history of seeing monkeys during a previous episode of meningoencephalitis suggests the possibility of a psychotic disorder. Given that the patient denies suicidal ideation and has a normal affect on exam, schizoaffective disorder is less likely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is Bipolar II disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Bipolar II disorder\"}"
