    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing a decrease in CD4 count and an increase in viral load despite ongoing treatment, indicating treatment failure. The new treatment regimen includes a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. This suggests the drug is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Among the given options, Lamivudine is an NRTI that acts by inhibiting reverse transcriptase and preventing viral DNA synthesis without requiring intracellular phosphorylation. Therefore, the most likely drug in this case is Lamivudine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lamivudine\"}"
