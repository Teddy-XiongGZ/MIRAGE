    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history of significant sun exposure and the physical examination findings of a dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug, the most likely diagnosis is a keratoacanthoma. Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule with a central keratin plug that typically develops on sun-exposed areas. It is often associated with a history of sunburns. Basal cell carcinoma is another common skin cancer that can present with similar features, but it typically has a more indolent growth pattern and may have more pronounced atypia on biopsy. Seborrheic keratosis is a benign skin lesion that is typically raised and has a stuck-on appearance, but it does not have the central keratin plug seen in this patient's lesion. Kaposi's sarcoma is a vascular tumor that is typically associated with immunosuppression and presents as purple or red macules, papules, or nodules, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Keratoacanthoma\"}"
