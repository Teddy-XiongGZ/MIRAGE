    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of STEMI and the findings on physical exam (jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema), it is likely that the patient is experiencing heart failure. The ejection fraction of 55% indicates that the patient has preserved systolic function. In patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, have been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations. Therefore, the medication with the greatest mortality benefit in this patient would be lisinopril.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lisinopril\"}"
