Schizoaffective disorder is a chronic mental illness that combines features of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder). The patient's symptoms of hearing voices, preparing for the end of the world, erratic behavior, and periods of sleeplessness and excessive spending are all consistent with schizoaffective disorder. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last for a brief period of time (less than 1 month) and are often precipitated by a significant stressor.
