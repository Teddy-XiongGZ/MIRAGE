Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. The motile organisms seen on the wet mount are characteristic of Trichomonas vaginalis. Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of sexually transmitted infections, but it typically presents with different symptoms such as mucopurulent cervical discharge and is not associated with the specific findings seen in this patient. Ureaplasma urealyticum is a bacterium that can cause genital infections, but it does not typically cause the characteristic symptoms and findings seen in this patient. Enterobius vermicularis is the causative organism of pinworm infection, which does not typically present with vaginal discharge or pelvic pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Trichomonas vaginalis\"}"
