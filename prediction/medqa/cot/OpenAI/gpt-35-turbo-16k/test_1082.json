    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of tense axillary bullae that do not rupture with light, gloved touch suggests a blistering disorder. The linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane seen on direct immunofluorescence are characteristic of an autoimmune blistering disorder. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is caused by exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and typically presents with diffuse erythema and superficial skin detachment. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by intraepidermal blistering and the presence of IgG autoantibodies against desmoglein 3. Cicatricial pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder that primarily affects mucous membranes and can lead to scarring. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder that primarily affects elderly individuals and is characterized by tense bullae and linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane. Given the patient's age, clinical presentation, and immunofluorescence findings, the most likely diagnosis is bullous pemphigoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Bullous pemphigoid\"}"
