Night terrors are a type of sleep disorder that typically occurs during non-REM sleep. During a night terror, the child may appear to be awake but is actually still asleep. They may scream, cry, and appear extremely distressed, but they are not fully conscious and do not respond to attempts to console them. Night terrors are more common in children and tend to resolve on their own as the child gets older. They are not associated with child abuse or the later development of a mood disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
