    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary measure used in this study can be determined by analyzing the information provided. The researchers calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to study mortality in relation to various factors. SMRs compare the observed number of deaths in a specific population to the expected number of deaths based on the general population. This allows for a comparison of mortality rates between different groups. Therefore, the primary measure used in this study can be defined as the observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
