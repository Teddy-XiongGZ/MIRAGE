    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation with hyperthermia, altered mental status, rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction is concerning for a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur as a result of the use of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. The patient's history of recent haloperidol administration and the presence of rigidity and altered mental status support this diagnosis. Heat stroke is a possibility given the high ambient temperature, but the patient's altered mental status and rigidity are not typical of heat stroke. Catatonic schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal motor behavior, but the patient's altered mental status and autonomic dysfunction are not consistent with this diagnosis. Oversedation is a possibility, but the patient's altered mental status and rigidity are not typical of oversedation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\"}"
