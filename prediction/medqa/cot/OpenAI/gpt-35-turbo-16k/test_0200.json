    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, it is likely that he ingested antifreeze, which contains ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is metabolized in the liver to toxic metabolites, including oxalic acid. Oxalic acid can combine with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals, which can be seen in the urine of patients with ethylene glycol poisoning. Therefore, the expected finding in this patient's urine would be calcium oxalate crystals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
