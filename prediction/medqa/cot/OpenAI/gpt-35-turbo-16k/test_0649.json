    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient's presentation is consistent with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. The presence of a blind-ended vaginal pouch on pelvic examination and the absence of a uterus and ovaries on ultrasonography support this diagnosis. MRKH syndrome is typically associated with normal secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and pubic hair growth. The most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is vaginal dilatory therapy, which involves using progressively larger dilators to stretch the vaginal pouch and create a neovagina. This treatment allows for the possibility of sexual intercourse and may improve body image and self-esteem. Gonadectomy is not indicated in this patient because MRKH syndrome does not involve abnormal gonadal development. Testosterone therapy is not indicated because this patient has normal secondary sexual characteristics. Prednisolone therapy is not indicated because MRKH syndrome is not associated with an autoimmune or inflammatory process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
