    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include difficulties fitting in, poor social skills, anxiety around other people, poor academic performance, preoccupation with paranormal phenomena, and strange beliefs about demons. These symptoms are suggestive of a personality disorder rather than a mood or psychotic disorder. The patient's avoidance of eye contact and laborious speech are consistent with social anxiety disorder, but the presence of strange beliefs and preoccupation with paranormal phenomena suggest a different diagnosis. Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, but it does not typically involve preoccupation with paranormal phenomena or strange beliefs. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and other symptoms that are not present in this patient. The most likely diagnosis in this case is schizotypal personality disorder, which is characterized by eccentric behavior, odd beliefs or magical thinking, and social and interpersonal deficits.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Schizotypal personality disorder\"}"
