    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with complaints of drowsiness at work despite getting a good night's sleep. The fact that he falls asleep during meetings suggests excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep journal and questionnaire reveal no significant findings related to sleep apnea or snoring. The sleep study reveals a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes, which is significantly shorter than the normal range of 10-20 minutes. This suggests that the patient may have narcolepsy. The best course of treatment for narcolepsy is sodium oxybate (choice B), which is a central nervous system depressant that helps improve sleep quality and reduce daytime sleepiness. Methylphenidate (choice A) is a stimulant that may be used to treat narcolepsy, but it is not the best initial choice. Imipramine (choice C) is an antidepressant that may be used to treat narcolepsy, but it is also not the best initial choice. Increasing daytime naps (choice D) may provide temporary relief, but it is not a definitive treatment for narcolepsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
