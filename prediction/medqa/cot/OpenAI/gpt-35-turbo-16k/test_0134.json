    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chronic glomerulonephritis can lead to renal dysfunction and impaired kidney function. One of the consequences of impaired kidney function is the inability to activate vitamin D, resulting in decreased levels of calcitriol. This can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism due to decreased calcium absorption in the gut and increased phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys. Therefore, the most expected laboratory findings in this patient would be increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, and decreased calcitriol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
