    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To detect the genetic material of HIV, the hospital would use a test that can amplify and detect the viral RNA or DNA. The most appropriate test for this purpose is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific technique that can detect even small amounts of viral genetic material. ELISA and Rapid HIV antibody tests are used to detect antibodies produced by the body in response to HIV infection, but they cannot directly detect the viral genetic material. Southern blot is a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, but it is not commonly used for HIV detection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
