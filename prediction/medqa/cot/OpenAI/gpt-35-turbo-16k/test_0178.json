    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. The MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. Based on this information, we can conclude that the lesion is affecting the left side of the spinal cord at the level of C5. The corticospinal tract is responsible for motor function, and it decussates (crosses over) in the medulla. Therefore, a lesion on the left side of the spinal cord at the level of C5 would affect the right corticospinal tract, leading to contralateral motor deficits. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be contralateral corticospinal tract involvement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
