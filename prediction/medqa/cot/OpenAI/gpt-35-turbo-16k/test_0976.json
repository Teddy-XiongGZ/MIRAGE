    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 25-year-old woman who presents with a missed menstrual cycle and a positive urine pregnancy test. She desires elective termination of pregnancy. Given her gestational age, which is likely less than 9 weeks, the most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy would be a medical abortion. The options for medical abortion include oral mifepristone followed by misoprostol or manual uterine aspiration. Oxytocin-induced labor and dilatation and evacuation (D&E) are not appropriate for early gestational age. Therefore, the most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient would be oral mifepristone + misoprostol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Oral mifepristone + misoprostol\"}"
