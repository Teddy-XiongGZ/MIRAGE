    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used in the treatment of sickle cell anemia. It works by increasing the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) in the patient's blood. This is important because HgbF has a higher affinity for oxygen than HgbS, the abnormal hemoglobin found in sickle cell anemia. By increasing the levels of HgbF, hydroxyurea helps to prevent the sickling of red blood cells and improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
