    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, and his blood pressure has been consistently elevated. He is currently on multiple antihypertensive medications, including hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and amlodipine. The renal duplex ultrasonography shows 90% occlusion of the right renal artery, indicating decreased blood flow to the kidney. Decreased renal blood flow can lead to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. The activation of RAAS can cause vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, leading to increased glomerular filtration pressure and subsequent hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
