    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process described in the question involves the binding of a labeled amino acid sequence to a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages. This process is indicative of a specific interaction between the labeled sequence and the protein, suggesting that the sequence is recognizing and binding to a specific target. This type of specific recognition and binding is characteristic of antibodies, which are produced by B cells through a process called VDJ recombination. VDJ recombination is the process by which B cells generate a diverse repertoire of antibodies with different antigen-binding specificities. Therefore, the correct answer is C. VDJ recombination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
