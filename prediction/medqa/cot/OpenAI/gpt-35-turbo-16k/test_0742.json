Among the given choices, the most likely cardiac complication in this case would be hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (choice A). This condition is characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to obstruction of blood flow. Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (choice B) is a temporary condition that can occur in infants of diabetic mothers, but it is not the most likely complication in this case. Tetralogy of Fallot (choice C) is a congenital heart defect that involves four specific abnormalities in the heart's structure, and it is not directly related to the mother's medical history. Mitral valve prolapse (choice D) is a condition where the mitral valve does not close properly, but it is not the most likely complication in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
