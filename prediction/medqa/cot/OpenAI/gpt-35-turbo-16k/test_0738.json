    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the case-fatality rate, we need to divide the number of deaths by the number of incident cases and multiply by 100 to get a percentage. The number of incident cases is calculated by multiplying the total number of individuals who dined at the restaurant by the incidence rate. In this case, the total number of individuals who dined at the restaurant is 500, and the incidence rate is 25%. Therefore, the number of incident cases is 500 * 0.25 = 125. The case-fatality rate is then calculated as 5 / 125 * 100 = 4%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
