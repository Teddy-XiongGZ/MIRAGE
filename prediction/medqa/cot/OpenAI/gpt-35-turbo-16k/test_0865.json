    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is unresponsive and has a low oxygen saturation despite being on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low PO2 and low O2 saturation. This suggests that the patient is not effectively oxygenating. The most likely cause of this is airway obstruction. Given the patient's history of smoking and recent surgery, it is possible that there is swelling or obstruction in the upper airway. The best next step in the management of this patient would be to reintubate him to secure the airway and ensure adequate oxygenation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Reintubate\"}"
