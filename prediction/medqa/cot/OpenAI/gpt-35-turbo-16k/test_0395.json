    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and history of increased albuterol use, it suggests that his asthma is not well controlled. The presence of late expiratory wheezes also indicates ongoing airway inflammation. Therefore, the current therapy should be modified to achieve better control of his asthma. The most appropriate option would be to add an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to his treatment regimen. ICS, such as fluticasone, is the preferred long-term controller medication for asthma in children. It helps reduce airway inflammation and improve asthma control. The addition of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA), such as salmeterol, may also be considered in patients with persistent asthma symptoms despite ICS use. However, it is usually reserved for patients who are not well controlled on ICS alone. Zileuton, a leukotriene modifier, is not typically used as a first-line therapy in children with asthma. Therefore, the most appropriate choice in this case would be to add fluticasone daily.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
