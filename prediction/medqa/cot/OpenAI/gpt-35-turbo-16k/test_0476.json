    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and a gallstone. The CBC reveals a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis, indicating increased red blood cell production. The increased RDW suggests variability in red blood cell size. The bilirubin panel shows an indirect hyperbilirubinemia, indicating increased breakdown of red blood cells. The negative Coombs test suggests that the anemia is not immune-mediated. The osmotic fragility test shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution, which is consistent with hereditary spherocytosis. Therefore, the most likely finding on a blood smear would be spherocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Spherocytes\"}"
