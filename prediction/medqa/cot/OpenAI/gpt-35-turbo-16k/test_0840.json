    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given information, we can determine the type of hypersensitivity reaction and the cell type involved. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE antibodies. It typically involves mast cells and basophils, not eosinophils. Type III hypersensitivity is an immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. It involves the deposition of immune complexes in tissues, leading to inflammation. CD4+ T cells are not directly involved in this type of reaction. Type IV hypersensitivity is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction mediated by T cells. It can be further divided into two subtypes: Type IVa, which is mediated by CD4+ T cells, and Type IVb, which is mediated by CD8+ T cells. Given that the reaction occurred 48 hours after the injection and resulted in a raised, slightly hardened area, it is indicative of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
