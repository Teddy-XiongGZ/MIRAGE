    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding, along with developmental delay (not able to sit upright on his own) and physical findings of tongue protrusion, distended neck veins, crackles in the lungs, S3 gallop, and hepatomegaly. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Pompe disease, which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme lysosomal acid maltase (choice C). Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycogen within lysosomes, leading to progressive muscle weakness and cardiomegaly. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase (choice A) is responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate in muscle tissue. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (choice B) is involved in the breakdown of fatty acids. Glycogen debranching enzyme (choice D) is responsible for the breakdown of glycogen into glucose in the liver and muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Lysosomal acid maltase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
