    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of photophobia, bilateral lacrimation, eye itching, and eyelid swelling, along with the image showing conjunctival injection and chemosis, the most likely diagnosis is allergic conjunctivitis. Given the patient's known allergy to cephalosporins, option A can be ruled out. Topical bacitracin (option B) is not the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Tetracycline (option C) is not recommended for use in children under 8 years of age due to the risk of tooth discoloration. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient's condition would be oral azithromycin (option D), which is effective in treating allergic conjunctivitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
