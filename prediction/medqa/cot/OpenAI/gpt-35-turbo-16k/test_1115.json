These symptoms are suggestive of a transfusion reaction. The sudden hypotension is concerning for an acute severe reaction. Given the symptoms and the timing of the reaction, the most likely diagnosis is an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.

The best treatment for an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is to discontinue the transfusion immediately.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion\"}"
