    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that works by irreversibly inhibiting the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cells. This enzyme system is responsible for the final step of gastric acid secretion, which involves the exchange of potassium ions for hydrogen ions across the parietal cell membrane. By inhibiting this enzyme system, omeprazole reduces the production of gastric acid, providing relief for conditions such as heartburn and duodenal ulcers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
