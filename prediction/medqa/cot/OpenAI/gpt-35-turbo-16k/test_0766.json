    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old healthy female who has not had a menstrual period. Physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair, indicating normal puberty development. However, transabdominal ultrasound reveals an absent uterus. This finding suggests a failure of paramesonephric duct development, which is responsible for the formation of the uterus. The absence of a uterus is consistent with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by the absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. MRKH syndrome is typically caused by a failure of paramesonephric duct development. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is D. Failure of paramesonephric duct development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
