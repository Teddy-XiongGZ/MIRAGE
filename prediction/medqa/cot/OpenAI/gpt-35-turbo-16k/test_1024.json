    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heart failure cells, also known as hemosiderin-containing macrophages, are formed due to the breakdown of red blood cells in the alveoli. This breakdown leads to the release of iron, which is then engulfed by macrophages. The iron is stored in lysosomes within the macrophages, resulting in the formation of hemosiderin-containing macrophages. Therefore, the cellular organelle significant in the formation of these cells is lysosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
