    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the patient has developed an upper respiratory infection. It is important to consider that illness can affect blood glucose levels and insulin requirements. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the physical examination is unremarkable. Therefore, it is unlikely that the illness is severe enough to warrant holding insulin. Additionally, reducing the insulin dose may lead to hyperglycemia.
