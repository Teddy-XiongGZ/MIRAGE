    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with retrosternal chest pain, which is concerning for a cardiac etiology. His medical history includes coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all of which increase his risk for cardiovascular events. His vital signs are concerning for hemodynamic instability, with a low blood pressure and a rapid, irregular pulse. The ECG shows atrial fibrillation. Given the patient's symptoms, medical history, and ECG findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics. The patient is likely experiencing rapid ventricular response due to atrial fibrillation, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and further compromise his blood pressure. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to control the ventricular rate with intravenous esmolol (Choice B). This will help stabilize the patient's hemodynamics and improve his symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
