    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-month-old boy who is presenting with difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported, weak cry and suck, symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, bell-shaped chest, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. These findings are suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder. The presence of symmetric flaccid weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes suggests a lower motor neuron (LMN) lesion. The bell-shaped chest is a characteristic finding in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is an anterior horn cell degeneration. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is anterior horn cell degeneration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
