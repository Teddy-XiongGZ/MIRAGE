    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with dyspnea and palpitations, along with an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. The initial treatment with IV digoxin resulted in a drop in heart rate to 85/min, but the rhythm remains irregular. Digoxin is a medication commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation, which is characterized by an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. Digoxin works by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium levels. This increase in intracellular calcium enhances the contractility of the myocardium, resulting in increased ventricular contractility. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased ventricular contractility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
