    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with altered mental status, high temperature, tachycardia, and altered muscle tone. The high temperature and altered mental status suggest a central cause. The patient has a history of recent anesthesia, which raises the possibility of malignant hyperthermia. However, the patient is also taking haloperidol, which is a neuroleptic medication. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur as a result of the use of neuroleptic medications. NMS is characterized by hyperthermia, altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and generalized muscle rigidity. The patient's altered mental status, hyperthermia, and altered muscle tone are consistent with NMS. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\"}"
