    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In order for neurotransmitters to be released from presynaptic nerve terminals, several events must occur. First, the presynaptic neuron must be depolarized, which leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx of calcium into the presynaptic terminal triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Therefore, the most likely event to occur immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters is the influx of calcium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
