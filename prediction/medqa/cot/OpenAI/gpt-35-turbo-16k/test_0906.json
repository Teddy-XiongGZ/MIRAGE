They can cause symptoms by obstructing blood flow through the mitral valve or by embolizing to other organs. On echocardiogram, atrial myxomas appear as a mass in the left atrium. Biopsy of the mass is likely to show a mixture of cells from different germinal layers, which is characteristic of atrial myxomas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
