    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation of inward turning of the left forefoot with concavity of the medial border, skin crease just below the ball of the great toe, and convexity of the lateral border is consistent with metatarsus adductus. The tickling of the lateral border leading to correction of the deformity further supports this diagnosis. Metatarsus adductus is a common congenital foot deformity that can be flexible or rigid. In flexible metatarsus adductus, the deformity can be passively corrected, while in rigid metatarsus adductus, the deformity cannot be corrected. The increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones on X-ray suggests a rigid deformity. The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to provide reassurance. Most cases of metatarsus adductus, including rigid deformities, resolve spontaneously within the first year of life without any intervention. Therefore, reassurance and observation are the initial management options. Foot abduction brace is used in the treatment of clubfoot, which is a different foot deformity. Arthrodesis of the forefoot and tarsometatarsal capsulotomy are not indicated in the management of metatarsus adductus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Reassurance\"}"
