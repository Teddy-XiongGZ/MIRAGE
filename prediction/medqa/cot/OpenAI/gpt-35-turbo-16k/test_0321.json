    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 55-year-old man recovering from knee replacement surgery who presents with sudden breathlessness, sharp chest pain on the right side with inspiration, tachycardia, and pain in the right calf on dorsiflexion. These findings are concerning for a pulmonary embolism (PE). PE is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot (usually from the deep veins of the legs) travels to the pulmonary arteries, causing obstruction. Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors (prolonged immobilization after surgery), a PE is highly likely. The best initial test to confirm the diagnosis of PE is a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan. This test evaluates the ventilation (airflow) and perfusion (blood flow) in the lungs. If the V/Q scan is inconclusive or not available, a lower extremity doppler ultrasound can be performed to assess for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs, which is a common precursor to PE. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and risk factors strongly suggest a PE, making the V/Q scan the most appropriate initial test. Therefore, the best course of management at this time is option C: Ventilation-perfusion scan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
