    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient with monoclonal gammopathy, which is often associated with plasma cell disorders such as multiple myeloma. The bone marrow biopsy shows monoclonal plasma cells, and further analysis reveals downregulation of class I major histocompatibility molecules in these cells. The question asks about the class of immune cells that prevent the proliferation of these abnormal plasma cells. The immune cells described in the question are able to lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Based on these characteristics, the best choice would be natural killer cells (C). Natural killer cells are part of the innate immune system and are able to recognize and kill abnormal cells, including tumor cells, without the need for prior sensitization or activation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
