    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 58-year-old man who is unable to achieve erections during sexual intercourse. This problem started 8 months ago when he became sexually active with a new girlfriend. He has a history of hyperlipidemia and major depressive disorder. He has been under a lot of stress lately and has not been sexually active for the past 3 years. He does not smoke but drinks 4-6 beers on weekends. His physical examination is unremarkable except for difficult to palpate pedal pulses. Given this clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step in management would be to evaluate for vascular insufficiency. The difficult to palpate pedal pulses suggest peripheral arterial disease (PAD) which can cause erectile dysfunction. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform nocturnal penile tumescence testing (Choice C) to assess for normal nocturnal erections and rule out organic causes of erectile dysfunction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
