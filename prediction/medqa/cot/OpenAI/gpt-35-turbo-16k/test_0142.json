    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, which is a known side effect of vincristine, a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Vincristine acts by inhibiting beta-tubulin polymerization, which disrupts microtubule formation and impairs axonal transport. This disruption of axonal transport leads to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's peripheral neuropathy is inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
