    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the most recent standards set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), residents are limited in the number of hours they can work to ensure patient safety. The ACGME has set a maximum limit of 80 hours per week averaged over a four-week period, with no more than 24 consecutive hours of work with an additional 4 hours for transitions of care. Given that the resident already works and trains 60 hours per week as a resident and has a 10-hour shift external to his residency program on Saturdays, we need to determine if he is within the allowed limits. Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the resident currently works per week: 60 hours (residency program) + 10 hours (external shift) = 70 hours per week Step 2: Check if the resident is within the allowed limits: The resident is currently working 70 hours per week, which is below the maximum limit of 80 hours per week set by the ACGME. Step 3: Determine if the resident can work more hours: Since the resident is already below the maximum limit, he may work additional hours if he chooses to do so. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding this resident's moonlighting and patient safety is that he may work up to 20 more hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
