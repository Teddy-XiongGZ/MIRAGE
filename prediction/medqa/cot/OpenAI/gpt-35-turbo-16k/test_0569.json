    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation with muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and altered mental status is consistent with serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. It can occur as a result of drug interactions or overdose with serotonergic medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The initial management of serotonin syndrome includes discontinuation of the offending agent, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment. Supportive therapy, such as IV fluids and cooling measures, has already been initiated in this patient. However, since the patient's symptoms persist despite initial measures, the best next step in management would be to administer dantrolene. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that acts by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby reducing muscle rigidity and hyperthermia. It is the specific antidote for malignant hyperthermia, a condition that shares some similarities with serotonin syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Dantrolene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
