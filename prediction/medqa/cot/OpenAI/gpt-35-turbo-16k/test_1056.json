    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is currently on clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic medication. Clozapine is known to have potential side effects that require monitoring. One of the most significant side effects of clozapine is agranulocytosis, a severe decrease in white blood cell count. This can lead to life-threatening infections. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient's complete blood count (CBC) regularly while on clozapine. Slit-lamp examination is not necessary for monitoring clozapine therapy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is not typically required for routine monitoring of clozapine. Prolactin level is not directly related to the side effects of clozapine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
