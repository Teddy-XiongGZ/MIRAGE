    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if two loci are closely linked, we can look at the LOD (logarithm of odds) score. The LOD score measures the likelihood of two loci being linked based on the observed data. A LOD score greater than 3 suggests strong evidence for linkage, while a LOD score less than 1 suggests weak evidence for linkage. In this case, if the novel mutation in the CFTR gene is closely linked to the commonly found \u0394F508 mutation, we would expect a high probability of co-inheritance of these two mutations in the population under study. Therefore, the most likely answer would be C. LOD Score > 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
