    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, she is presenting with acute-onset confusion, unsteady gait, and memory impairment. These symptoms are consistent with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO poisoning can occur from faulty heating systems, such as wood-burning stoves or fireplaces, which may have been used in the lakeside cabin. The most effective intervention for CO poisoning is 100% oxygen therapy. This therapy helps to rapidly eliminate CO from the body by increasing the oxygen concentration in the blood, which promotes the dissociation of CO from hemoglobin and enhances its elimination through the lungs. Intravenous nitroprusside is not indicated in this case, as it is used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is reserved for severe cases of CO poisoning or when there is evidence of end-organ damage. Heliox therapy, a mixture of helium and oxygen, is not indicated in this case as it is primarily used for the treatment of upper airway obstruction or severe asthma exacerbations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 100% oxygen therapy\"}"
