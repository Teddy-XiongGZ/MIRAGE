    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this case is a 27-year-old man who presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient's echocardiogram is notable only for sinus tachycardia. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 107/58 mmHg, pulse of 120/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is complaining of chest pain and has bruising over his chest wall. Given the mechanism of injury and the presence of chest pain and bruising, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac contusion. Cardiac contusion refers to blunt injury to the heart, typically caused by a direct blow to the chest. It can result in myocardial injury, leading to elevated troponins and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Hemorrhage and pulmonary contusion are less likely in this case, as the patient's vital signs are stable and there are no signs of significant bleeding or respiratory distress. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, typically presents with acute chest pain and ECG changes, but it is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women and is often triggered by emotional or physical stress. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is A. Cardiac contusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
