    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 28-year-old female with episodic chest pain that has been happening every few days for 3 months. The pain is described as squeezing and tightness in her chest. There is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her vital signs are normal and there is no family history of chest pain. The EKG in the office is normal, but 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. Based on this information, the most likely mechanism of this patient's chest pain is coronary artery vasospasm, which is characteristic of variant (Prinzmetal's) angina. This is similar to the mechanism behind Raynaud's phenomenon, where there is vasospasm of the small arteries in the extremities. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Raynaud's phenomenon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
