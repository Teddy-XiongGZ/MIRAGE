    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden nose bleeding without trauma, multiple bruising, and tiny red spots in the extremities. The vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. The physical exam reveals pale skin color, petechiae in the soft palate and extremities, and ecchymosis in the hands and feet. The complete blood count shows low hemoglobin and normal platelet count. The coagulation test results are normal. The blood smear shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets. The platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. The overall bleeding time is increased. Based on these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is Bernard-Soulier disease, which is characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex on the platelet surface, leading to impaired platelet adhesion. This results in a prolonged bleeding time and the clinical manifestations seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bernard-Soulier disease\"}"
