    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise, which are symptoms of cardiac dysfunction. The wide splitting of S2 suggests a delay in the closure of the pulmonic valve, indicating a right ventricular issue. The loud second component of S2 heard at the 2nd left intercostal space further supports a right ventricular problem. Given the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely cause of her cardiac findings is an increased right ventricular afterload. This can be seen in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
