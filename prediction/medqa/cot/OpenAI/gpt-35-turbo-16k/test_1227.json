    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic drug that acts on adrenergic receptors. It has both alpha and beta adrenergic effects. In this scenario, the patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction, which is a severe allergic reaction. Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis. When administered, epinephrine acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle, causing bronchodilation. This helps to relieve the bronchoconstriction that occurs during anaphylaxis. Therefore, the expected effect of epinephrine treatment would be increased bronchodilation. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
