    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, palpitations, and angioedema are consistent with an anaphylactic reaction to the bee sting. The initial management of anaphylaxis includes ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, as well as administering epinephrine. In this case, the patient has already been intubated and received intramuscular epinephrine. Despite these efforts, the patient's blood pressure remains low. The next step in the management of anaphylactic shock is to administer vasopressors to increase systemic vascular resistance and improve blood pressure. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are commonly used vasopressors. Glucagon is not typically used in the management of anaphylactic shock. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that may be beneficial in reducing inflammation and preventing late-phase reactions, but it is not the next best step in this acute situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Administer norepinephrine\"}"
