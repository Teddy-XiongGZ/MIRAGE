    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most effective disinfectant to inactivate a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes, we need to consider the characteristics of the virus and the properties of the disinfectants. Picornaviruses are non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome. They are resistant to many disinfectants due to their stable capsid structure. A. Chlorhexidine: Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antiseptic that is effective against many bacteria and some enveloped viruses. However, it is not effective against non-enveloped viruses like picornaviruses. B. Sodium hypochlorite: Sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as bleach, is a strong oxidizing agent that is effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. It can disrupt the capsid structure of picornaviruses and inactivate them. C. Sulfuric acid: Sulfuric acid is a strong acid that is not typically used as a disinfectant. It is unlikely to be effective against picornaviruses. D. Ethyl alcohol: Ethyl alcohol, also known as ethanol, is a common disinfectant that is effective against many bacteria and enveloped viruses. However, it is less effective against non-enveloped viruses like picornaviruses. Based on the above information, the most likely disinfectant to inactivate the picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes is B. Sodium hypochlorite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
