    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with sudden onset of shortness of breath and substernal chest pain at rest, which is increased by inspiration. He also has a nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise for the past 5 days. These symptoms are suggestive of an acute infectious process. The physical examination findings of distended neck veins, bilateral basilar rales, and muffled heart sounds are consistent with fluid overload.
