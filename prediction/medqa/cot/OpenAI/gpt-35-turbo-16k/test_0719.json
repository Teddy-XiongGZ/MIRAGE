    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), which is an important regulator of oxygen binding to hemoglobin. Elevated levels of bisphosphoglycerate mutase would suggest an increased production or accumulation of 2,3-BPG. Among the given choices, the enzyme most directly involved in the production of 2,3-BPG is pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step in glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. Therefore, if there is an elevated concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase, it is most likely that pyruvate kinase would be absent in these cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
