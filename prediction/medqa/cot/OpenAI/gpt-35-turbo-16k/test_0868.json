    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 80-year-old man with fatigue, lightheadedness, bradycardia (pulse of 48/min), and hypotension (blood pressure of 89/50 mm Hg). These findings suggest hemodynamic instability. The ECG findings of left axis deviation, a Q wave in lead III, a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, and a QRS interval of .09 seconds are consistent with third-degree heart block. Third-degree heart block is a complete block of electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles, resulting in independent atrial and ventricular rhythms. In this patient, the slow ventricular rate and hypotension are likely due to the loss of atrial kick and decreased cardiac output. The most appropriate next step in management is cardiac pacing (choice C) to restore atrioventricular synchrony and improve cardiac output.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
