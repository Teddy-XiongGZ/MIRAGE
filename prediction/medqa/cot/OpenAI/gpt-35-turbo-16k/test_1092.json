    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing trouble sleeping and is unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening. This suggests a disruption in the sleep-wake cycle. The fact that the patient recently retired from working the day shift at a cemetery indicates a change in his daily routine. The inability to stay awake in the evening and feeling rested when waking up suggests a shift in the timing of the sleep-wake cycle. This is consistent with advanced sleep phase disorder, which is characterized by a preference for earlier sleep and wake times. Obstructive sleep apnea is unlikely as the patient's wife claims he sleeps peacefully. Chronic insomnia is also unlikely as the patient feels rested when waking up. Normal aging may cause changes in sleep patterns, but it is less likely to be the primary cause in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Advanced sleep phase disorder\"}"
