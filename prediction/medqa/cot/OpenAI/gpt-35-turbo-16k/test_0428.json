    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is likely that he has developed herpetic whitlow, which is a viral infection of the finger. The presence of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger is consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's exposure to poison oak is unlikely to be related to his current symptoms. The leukocytosis seen on laboratory studies is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in viral infections.
