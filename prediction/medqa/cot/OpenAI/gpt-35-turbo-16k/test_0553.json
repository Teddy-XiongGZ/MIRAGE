    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The physician suspects that the patient may have elevated aldosterone levels, which can contribute to hypertension. The best medication to initiate in this case would be an aldosterone receptor antagonist. Spironolactone and eplerenone are both aldosterone receptor antagonists and are commonly used to treat hypertension. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic and does not directly target aldosterone receptors. Ethacrynic acid is a loop diuretic and also does not target aldosterone receptors. Given the patient's concerns about side effects, particularly impotence and gynecomastia, it would be best to choose eplerenone as it has a lower risk of these side effects compared to spironolactone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Eplerenone\"}"
