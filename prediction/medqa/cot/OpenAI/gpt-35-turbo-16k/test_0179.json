    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a sexually active young man presenting with right-sided scrotal pain, burning sensation on urination, and increased urinary frequency. Physical examination reveals a tender right testicle that is relieved with lifting. These findings are consistent with epididymitis, which is inflammation of the epididymis. The most common cause of epididymitis in sexually active men under the age of 35 is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The most likely STI causing these symptoms in this patient is Chlamydia trachomatis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is another possible cause of epididymitis, but the absence of urethral discharge and the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram stain make it less likely. Testicular tumor and varicocele are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
