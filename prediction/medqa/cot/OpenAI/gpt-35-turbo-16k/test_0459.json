    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). SCFE is a condition that occurs in adolescents, particularly those who are obese, and is characterized by displacement of the femoral head off the femoral neck. The patient's symptoms of severe right hip and knee pain, limited range of motion in the right hip, and external rotation of the right leg are consistent with SCFE. The radiographic findings of displacement of the right femoral head inferoposteriorly further support this diagnosis. The most appropriate course of treatment for SCFE is surgical pinning of the affected hip joint. This procedure stabilizes the femoral head and prevents further displacement, reducing the risk of complications such as avascular necrosis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Surgical pinning of the right hip.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
