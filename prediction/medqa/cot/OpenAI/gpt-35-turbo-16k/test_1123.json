    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 72-year-old woman presenting with a 1-month history of frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, and myalgias. Physical examination findings include pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye. Laboratory studies show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 65 mm/h. Temporal artery biopsy findings are consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), characterized by transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. The treatment initiated for GCA is high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. Given this clinical scenario, the patient is at greatest risk of developing complications related to large vessel involvement. The most common large vessel involved in GCA is the thoracic aorta. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk of developing a thoracic aortic aneurysm (choice D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
