    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of memory loss, confusion, coordination problems, hallucinations, and paranoia, along with the presence of myoclonus and ataxia on physical exam, the most likely cause of his symptoms is a prion disease. Prion diseases are caused by abnormal proteins called prions, which can be transmitted through contaminated medical equipment even after autoclaving. Prions contain genetic material and are able to survive independent from a host. They do not have a cell wall containing peptidoglycan, which is a characteristic of bacteria. Intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are seen in Alzheimer's disease, not prion diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
