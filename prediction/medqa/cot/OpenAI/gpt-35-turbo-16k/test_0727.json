    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and weight loss, which are suggestive of a systemic illness. The presence of nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and bilateral mediastinal masses on chest x-ray indicate lymphadenopathy and lymphoma involvement. The photomicrograph of the resected specimen is likely to show characteristic findings of a specific type of lymphoma. Let's evaluate each answer choice:\\n\\nA. Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30: This staining pattern is seen in Hodgkin lymphoma, specifically the nodular sclerosis subtype. However, the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the question are not consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma.\\n\\nB. Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement: BCR-ABL rearrangement is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), not lymphoma. The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are not consistent with CML.\\n\\nC. Cells overexpressing Bcl-2: Bcl-2 overexpression is seen in follicular lymphoma, a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. However, the patient's clinical presentation with episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and weight loss, along with the presence of mediastinal masses, is more suggestive of a high-grade lymphoma.\\n\\nD. Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation: This translocation is characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma, a high-grade B-cell lymphoma. The clinical presentation of episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, weight loss, and the presence of mediastinal masses is consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. Therefore, the most likely finding on histopathological examination is cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
