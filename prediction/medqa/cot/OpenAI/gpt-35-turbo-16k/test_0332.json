    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of digitalis toxicity, which include nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness. The fact that his serum digoxin level is above the therapeutic range further supports this diagnosis. To determine the mechanism of digitalis toxicity in this patient, we need to consider the factors that can lead to increased digoxin levels in the body. Option A, drug-induced hypokalemia, is a known risk factor for digitalis toxicity as low potassium levels can increase the binding of digoxin to its target receptor. However, there is no information provided in the question stem to suggest that the patient has hypokalemia. Option B, increased intestinal absorption of digoxin, is not a likely mechanism in this case as there is no information provided to suggest any changes in the patient's gastrointestinal function. Option C, inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme, is not the most likely mechanism in this case as there is no mention of any medications that would inhibit this enzyme. Option D, inhibition of P-glycoprotein, is the most likely mechanism in this case. P-glycoprotein is responsible for the efflux of digoxin from the cells, and inhibition of this transporter can lead to increased digoxin levels in the body. Verapamil, which was recently added to the patient's medication regimen, is known to inhibit P-glycoprotein. Therefore, option D is the most likely explanation for the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
