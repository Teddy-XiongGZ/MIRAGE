    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In cross-bridge cycling, myosin interacts with actin to generate muscle contraction. The cycle consists of several steps: myosin head binding to actin, myosin head cocking, phosphate release, power stroke, and ADP release. The drug in question selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head. Phosphate release occurs after myosin head binding to actin and before the power stroke. Therefore, if phosphate release is blocked, the most likely step to be affected is the power stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
