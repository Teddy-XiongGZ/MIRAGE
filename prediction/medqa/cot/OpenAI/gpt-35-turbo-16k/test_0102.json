    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with absent deep tendon reflexes bilaterally, which is a concerning finding. This could be a sign of magnesium toxicity, as magnesium sulfate can cause neuromuscular blockade. The first step in management would be to stop the magnesium sulfate to prevent further toxicity. Option A, stopping magnesium sulfate and giving calcium gluconate, is the correct choice as calcium gluconate can help reverse the effects of magnesium toxicity. Option B, stopping labetalol, is not necessary as labetalol is not causing the absent deep tendon reflexes. Option C, stopping magnesium sulfate and giving lorazepam, is not appropriate as lorazepam does not reverse magnesium toxicity. Option D, performing nerve conduction studies, may be considered later if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
