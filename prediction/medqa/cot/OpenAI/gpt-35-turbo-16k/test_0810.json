    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 49-year-old woman with anemia, spherocytes on peripheral blood smear, scleral icterus, and splenomegaly. These findings are consistent with hemolytic anemia. The negative Coombs test suggests that the hemolysis is not immune-mediated. The most likely diagnosis in this patient is hereditary spherocytosis, which is a disorder characterized by defects in the red blood cell membrane. The most appropriate diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis is the eosin-5-maleimide binding test, which measures the binding of eosin-5-maleimide to red blood cell membrane proteins. This test is highly sensitive and specific for hereditary spherocytosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
