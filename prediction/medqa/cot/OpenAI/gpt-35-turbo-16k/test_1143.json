    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. This suggests that there is a genetic condition in the family. The fact that the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation indicates that the condition is not inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This rules out variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. Maternal uniparental disomy refers to the inheritance of both copies of a chromosome from one parent, which is not relevant in this case. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected is gonadal mosaicism, where the mutation is present in some of the patient's germ cells but not in his somatic cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Gonadal mosaicism\"}"
