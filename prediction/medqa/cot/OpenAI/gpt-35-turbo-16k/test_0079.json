    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this scenario has a penetrating wound to the chest with a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate surgical intervention. Option A, immediate cardiac transplant, is not feasible in this acute setting. Option B, watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated, is not appropriate as the patient is already receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and requires definitive surgical management. Option D, needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space, is used for tension pneumothorax and is not indicated in this case. The best definitive surgical approach for this patient is option C, interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets. This technique allows for repair of the full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall and control of bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
