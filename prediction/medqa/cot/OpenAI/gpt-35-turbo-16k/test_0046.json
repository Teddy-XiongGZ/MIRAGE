    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes, we need to find the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and then calculate the reciprocal of the ARR. The ARR is calculated by subtracting the event rate in the treatment group from the event rate in the control group. In this case, the event rate in the treatment group is 134/1500 = 0.0893 and the event rate in the control group is 210/1500 = 0.14. Therefore, the ARR is 0.14 - 0.0893 = 0.0507. The NNT is then calculated by taking the reciprocal of the ARR, which is approximately 1/0.0507 = 19.7. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the NNT is 20.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
