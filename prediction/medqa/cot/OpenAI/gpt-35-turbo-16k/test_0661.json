    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old girl with sweating and respiratory distress while eating, which suggests a cardiac problem. The echocardiography findings of a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction are consistent with ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSD is a common congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the interventricular septum. The defect allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow and left-to-right shunting. The physical examination findings associated with VSD include a systolic murmur and signs of increased pulmonary blood flow, such as a wide and fixed split second heart sound. Therefore, the most likely finding on physical examination in this patient is a systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
