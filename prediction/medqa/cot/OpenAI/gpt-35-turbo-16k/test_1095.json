    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The CT scan shows a soft bulge on the left side of the abdomen, which is likely indicative of a hernia. The muscle located directly medial to the hernia is the rectus abdominis. The rectus abdominis muscle is located in the midline of the abdomen, running vertically from the pubic bone to the sternum. It is surrounded by the external oblique muscle on its lateral side and the transverse abdominal muscle on its deep side. The psoas major muscle is located more posteriorly and would not be directly medial to the hernia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Rectus abdominis\"}"
