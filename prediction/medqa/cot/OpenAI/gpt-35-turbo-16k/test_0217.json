    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings, this patient is experiencing a missed abortion, which is the intrauterine death of an embryo or fetus before 20 weeks' gestation with retention of the nonviable pregnancy. The dilated cervical os and absence of fetal cardiac activity on ultrasound confirm the diagnosis. The most appropriate next step in management is to offer the patient options for management. These options include expectant management, medical management with misoprostol, or surgical management with dilation and curettage. Complete bed rest is not indicated as it has not been shown to improve outcomes in cases of missed abortion. Methotrexate therapy is used for the management of ectopic pregnancy, not missed abortion. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to offer her options for management, including expectant management, medical management with misoprostol, or surgical management with dilation and curettage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
