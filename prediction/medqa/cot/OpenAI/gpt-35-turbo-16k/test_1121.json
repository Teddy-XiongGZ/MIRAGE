    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 25-year-old woman with periodic painful double vision that occurs only when looking sideways. She has a history of myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she had a fall from her bike and had a CT scan of the head, which showed no abnormalities. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. On examination, she has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left, and an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Based on these findings, the most likely cause of her symptoms is demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). The MLF is responsible for coordinating eye movements, and demyelination can result in internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is characterized by an adduction deficit in one eye and nystagmus in the other eye when looking in the direction of the affected eye. This is consistent with the patient's findings. Compressive tumor of the pons can cause similar symptoms, but the absence of other signs of brainstem dysfunction and the normal CT scan make this less likely. Thiamine deficiency can cause Wernicke encephalopathy, which can present with ophthalmoplegia, but this is typically associated with other signs of thiamine deficiency, such as ataxia and altered mental status. Infarction of the brainstem can cause similar symptoms, but the absence of other signs of brainstem dysfunction and the normal CT scan make this less likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
