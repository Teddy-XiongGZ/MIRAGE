    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea, along with the physical examination findings of left lower quadrant tenderness, suggest acute diverticulitis. The CT scan findings of segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels further support this diagnosis. The drainage of yellow-greenish fluid from the pelvic lesion indicates the presence of an abscess. In the context of diverticulitis, the most likely mechanism for abscess formation is the release of lysosomal enzymes. These enzymes are released by neutrophils and macrophages in response to bacterial infection, and they contribute to tissue damage and abscess formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lysosomal enzymes\"}"
