    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with anorexia nervosa, which is characterized by a distorted body image, fear of gaining weight, and refusal to maintain a healthy body weight. The patient denies being underweight despite objective evidence of anorexia. Given her low blood pressure and pulse, she likely has cardiovascular compromise due to malnutrition. The best option for long-term management of anorexia nervosa is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which has been shown to be effective in treating this condition. CBT helps patients identify and challenge their distorted thoughts and beliefs about body image and weight. In-patient psychiatric therapy may be necessary in severe cases, but it is not the first-line option. Antidepressants may be used as an adjunctive treatment in some cases, but they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa. Appetite stimulants are not recommended as they may reinforce the patient's disordered eating behavior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
