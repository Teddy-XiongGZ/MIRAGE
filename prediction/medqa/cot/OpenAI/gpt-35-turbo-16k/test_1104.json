    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation, the bright red blood in the stool, and the presence of a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion superior to the pectinate line on anoscopy, the most likely diagnosis is internal hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids are dilated veins located above the pectinate line, and they can cause bright red blood in the stool. The fact that the vascular protrusion is non-tender suggests that it is not an acute thrombosed hemorrhoid. The presence of multiple purple spider web-like lesions on the chest and arms that blanch with pressure suggests the presence of spider angiomas, which can be seen in patients with liver disease. The distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion is consistent with ascites, which can also be seen in liver disease. Given the patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and recent appendicitis, it is less likely that peptic ulcer disease is the cause of his current symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
