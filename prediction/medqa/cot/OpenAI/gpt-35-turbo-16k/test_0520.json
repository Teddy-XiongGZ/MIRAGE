    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene result in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is responsible for removing calcium ions from the cytosol of skeletal muscle cells. Without this pump, the cytosolic calcium concentration would be expected to increase. The symptoms described in the question, muscle cramping and stiffening that is most severe after exercise and relieved after rest, are consistent with increased cytosolic calcium concentration. Increased cytosolic calcium concentration would lead to prolonged muscle contraction and delayed muscle relaxation. Therefore, the expected findings in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation would be increased muscle relaxation time and increased cytosolic calcium concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
