The patient's symptoms of intermittent pain after a heavy meal and the inspiratory pause on palpation over the right upper quadrant are suggestive of biliary colic. The combination of acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis is known as Mirizzi syndrome. The patient's vital signs are stable, indicating that he is not in septic shock.
