    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with an anaphylactic reaction after eating a peanut butter sandwich. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can cause cardiovascular collapse. The drug administered to this patient is likely epinephrine, which is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis. Epinephrine acts on cardiac pacemaker cells by increasing Ca2+ influx in phase 4 of the action potential. This increases the rate of depolarization and enhances the heart's ability to generate electrical impulses. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
