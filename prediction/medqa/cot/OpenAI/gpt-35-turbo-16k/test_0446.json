    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient has been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The patient has been prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker. Class I anti-arrhythmic drugs are further classified into three subclasses (IA, IB, and IC) based on their effects on the action potential duration and conduction velocity. The drug described in the question is a sodium channel blocker that prolongs action potential duration and slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. It also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. Given this information, we can eliminate options B, C, and D as potential side effects of the drug. Option A, which includes headache and tinnitus, is the most likely side effect of the drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
