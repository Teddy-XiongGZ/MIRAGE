    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss, which are consistent with hyperglycemia. The physical examination findings, such as dry skin, pustular rash, and distal loss of vibration sensitivity, are also suggestive of diabetes. The HbA1c level of 9% confirms the diagnosis of diabetes. The urinalysis shows glucose in the urine (glucosuria) along with other findings. Glucose is normally reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules by secondary active transporters. In diabetes, when blood glucose levels exceed the renal threshold, the transporters become saturated and glucose spills into the urine. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
