    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of linear immunofluorescence and IgG antibodies in the epidermal basement membrane suggests an autoimmune blistering disorder. The most common autoimmune blistering disorder is bullous pemphigoid, which is characterized by the binding of IgG antibodies to hemidesmosomes. Hemidesmosomes are cell junctions that anchor the basal keratinocytes to the underlying basement membrane. Therefore, the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind in this case is hemidesmosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
