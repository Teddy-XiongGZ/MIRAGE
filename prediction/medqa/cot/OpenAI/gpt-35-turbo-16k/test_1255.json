    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is likely that she is experiencing acute vision loss in her left eye. The lack of response when shining a light in her left eye suggests that there is no pupillary constriction, which is known as afferent pupillary defect (APD) or Marcus Gunn pupil. This indicates a problem with the optic nerve or retina of the left eye. In this scenario, the expected response when shining a light in her right eye would be normal pupillary constriction, indicating intact function of the optic nerve and retina in the right eye. Therefore, the answer choice would be B. Miosis of the right eye only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
