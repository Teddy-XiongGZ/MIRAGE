    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed, we need to compare the proportion of GERD cases among alcoholics to the proportion of GERD cases among non-alcoholics. First, let's calculate the proportion of GERD cases among alcoholics. Out of the 200 alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. So, the proportion of GERD cases among alcoholics is 30/200. Next, let's calculate the proportion of GERD cases among non-alcoholics. Out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. So, the proportion of GERD cases among non-alcoholics is 30/400. To determine the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed, we need to compare these two proportions. Therefore, the answer is (30/200) / (30/400).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. (30/200) / (30/400)\"}"
