    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient delivered a baby at term and had normal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, indicating that the baby was in good condition at birth. However, 30 minutes after delivery, the mother's blood pressure drops and her pulse increases, suggesting hypovolemia. On physical examination, her distal extremities are clammy and cold, and the uterus is boggy, which are signs of postpartum hemorrhage. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, and after receiving IV fluids and whole blood, her vitals stabilize. The next morning, she reports inability to lactate when trying to breastfeed her child. Given the clinical scenario, the most likely cause of the failure of lactation in this patient is the remains of placenta in the uterus (B). Postpartum hemorrhage can lead to retained placental tissue, which can cause disruption of the normal hormonal regulation of lactation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
