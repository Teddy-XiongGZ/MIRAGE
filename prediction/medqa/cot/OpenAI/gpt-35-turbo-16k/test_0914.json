    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rigidity observed in the body is known as rigor mortis, which is a postmortem phenomenon. Rigor mortis occurs due to the depletion of ATP in the muscles after death. ATP is required for muscle relaxation, and in its absence, the muscles remain contracted, leading to rigidity. Therefore, the correct answer is not related to the snake bite or any toxins, but rather the depletion of ATP. The correct answer is not A. Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins. The correct answer is not B. Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins. The correct answer is not C. Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling. The correct answer is not D. Depletion of intracellular calcium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
