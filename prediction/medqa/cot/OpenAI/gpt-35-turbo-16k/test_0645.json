    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient has a thyroid mass that has steadily increased in size over the past 5 months. The mass is hard, moves with swallowing, and is found on the left side of the neck. The ultrasound shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy was inconclusive. The surgical findings reveal a gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins.
