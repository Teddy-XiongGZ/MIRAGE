    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation of intermittent vertigo, vomiting, complete hearing loss in the left ear, and a history of untreated ear infection, the most likely diagnosis is acute otitis media with complications, specifically, acute mastoiditis. The suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane and immobility of the tympanic membrane confirmed by the pneumatoscope support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest the presence of a bacterial infection. The most appropriate antibiotic choice for acute mastoiditis is intravenous ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, which provide coverage against the most common pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Cefotaxime.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
