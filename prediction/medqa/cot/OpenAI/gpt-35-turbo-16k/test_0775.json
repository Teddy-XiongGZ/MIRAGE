    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The bullet wound is at the level of L3, which is in the lower back region. At this level, the potential vascular structures that might have been injured include the inferior vena cava, internal iliac vein, renal artery, and portal vein. The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the heart. The internal iliac vein is a vein that drains blood from the pelvis and lower limbs. The renal artery is an artery that supplies blood to the kidneys. The portal vein is a vein that carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver. Considering the location of the wound and the potential structures in that area, the most likely vascular structure to be injured would be the inferior vena cava.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
