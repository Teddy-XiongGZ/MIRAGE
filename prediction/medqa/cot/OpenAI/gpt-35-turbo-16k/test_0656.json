    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 55-year-old man with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and a history of peptic ulcer disease. The brown/red color of the vomitus suggests the presence of blood. The physical exam findings of a tense abdomen with board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness are concerning for peritonitis. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a perforated gastric peptic ulcer, as it can lead to peritonitis and the characteristic findings on physical exam. An erect abdominal x-ray may show free air under the diaphragm, which would further support the diagnosis of a perforated ulcer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Perforated gastric peptic ulcer\"}"
