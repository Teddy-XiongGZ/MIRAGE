    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with worsening pain in multiple joints, with involvement of proximal parts of fingers and wrists, symmetric joint involvement, morning joint stiffness that improves with activity, and fatigue. These symptoms are suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and difficulty controlling blood glucose levels. Additionally, there is unintentional weight loss. Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The first-line medication for RA is methotrexate (C). Infliximab (A) and anakinra (B) are biologic agents used in the treatment of RA, but they are typically reserved for patients who have failed methotrexate or other conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). High-dose prednisone (D) may be used for short-term symptom relief, but it is not the first-line treatment for RA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
