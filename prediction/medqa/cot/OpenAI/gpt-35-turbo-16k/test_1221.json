    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of alcoholism and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine suggest the possibility of ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol is a toxic alcohol that can cause acute kidney injury. One of the key metabolic abnormalities seen in ethylene glycol poisoning is anion gap metabolic acidosis. This occurs due to the metabolism of ethylene glycol to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, which leads to the accumulation of acidic metabolites. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be anion gap metabolic acidosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
