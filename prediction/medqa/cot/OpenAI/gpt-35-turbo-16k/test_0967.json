    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a scaphoid fracture. Scaphoid fractures are common in young adults and often occur due to a fall on an outstretched hand. The patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, limited range of motion, and decreased grip strength are consistent with this diagnosis. X-rays may not show abnormalities immediately after the injury, as it takes time for the fracture line to become visible. Therefore, the initial x-rays may be normal, but a scaphoid fracture should still be suspected. Finkelstein's test is negative, which helps to rule out de Quervain tenosynovitis. The most appropriate next step in management is to immobilize the wrist with a thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks. This is because scaphoid fractures have a high risk of nonunion, and early immobilization can improve healing. Corticosteroid injections are not indicated for scaphoid fractures. Rest, ice, and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks may be appropriate for some injuries, but given the suspicion for a scaphoid fracture, immobilization is necessary. Percutaneous pinning is not the initial treatment for a scaphoid fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
