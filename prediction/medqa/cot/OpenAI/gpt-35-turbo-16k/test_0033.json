These symptoms are suggestive of a malabsorptive syndrome. The endoscopy findings of prominent rugae in the gastric fundus and biopsy showing parietal cell atrophy are consistent with a diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia is caused by autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells, leading to decreased production of intrinsic factor and subsequent vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can result in malabsorption and the symptoms described. The most likely underlying cause of pernicious anemia is autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells, which is associated with the presence of autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Ectopic secretion of gastrin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
