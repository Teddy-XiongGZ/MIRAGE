    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described (painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities), the most likely diagnosis for this patient is acute rheumatic fever. Acute rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated streptococcal throat infection. One of the major criteria for diagnosing acute rheumatic fever is the presence of migratory polyarthritis, which is characterized by inflammation and pain in multiple joints that moves from one joint to another. Therefore, the most likely symptom to be present in this patient is joint pain or migratory polyarthritis. Chorea (involuntary movements), renal failure, hepatomegaly, and pleural effusion are not typically associated with acute rheumatic fever.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
