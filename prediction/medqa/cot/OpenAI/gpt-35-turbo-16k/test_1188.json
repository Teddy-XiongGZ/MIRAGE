    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, it undergoes maturation in the thymus. The T cell progenitor first becomes a pre-T cell, which expresses both CD4 and CD8 co-receptors. Then, it goes through a stage called double-positive T cell, where it expresses both CD4 and CD8 co-receptors. During this stage, positive selection occurs, which ensures the preservation of self-MHC-restricted T cells. After positive selection, the T cell differentiates into either a single-positive CD4+ T cell or a single-positive CD8+ T cell, depending on the MHC molecule it interacts with. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Double-positive T cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
