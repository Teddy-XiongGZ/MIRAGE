    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute gouty arthritis, which is characterized by sudden severe pain, erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the affected joint. The presence of tophi (tophaceous gout) and a history of nephrolithiasis are also suggestive of gout. The elevated serum uric acid level further supports the diagnosis. Arthrocentesis findings of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils) are consistent with an acute inflammatory process. Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid would show negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals, confirming the diagnosis of gout. The most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for gout is aimed at reducing serum uric acid levels. This can be achieved by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
