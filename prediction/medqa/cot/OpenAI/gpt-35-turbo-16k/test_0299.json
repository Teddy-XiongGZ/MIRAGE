    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the factor by which resistance to blood flow has increased in the occluded vessel, we need to compare it to a vessel with no occlusion. The resistance to blood flow in a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its radius. Since the occlusion has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery, the radius of the occluded vessel is reduced by 50% as well. Therefore, the resistance to blood flow in the occluded vessel has increased by a factor of (1/0.5)^4 = 16.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
