    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, generalized fatigue, chills, right-side abdominal pain, and nausea. On examination, the liver is palpated below the right costal margin and is tender. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. Laboratory studies show leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated liver enzymes, and an ultrasound showing a dilated common bile duct. These findings are consistent with acute cholangitis, which is an infection of the biliary tract. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to both diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the cholangitis, such as a common bile duct stone or stricture. ERCP allows for direct visualization of the biliary tree and can be used to remove stones, dilate strictures, or place stents. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
