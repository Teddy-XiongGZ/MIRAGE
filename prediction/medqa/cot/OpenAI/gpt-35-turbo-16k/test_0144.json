    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old girl with short stature. Her father also had a short stature during his teenage years. She is at the 2nd percentile for height and has delayed bone age. Her breast development is Tanner stage 2, and she has no pubic or axillary hair. These findings suggest a delayed puberty. The most likely diagnosis is constitutional growth delay, which is a common cause of short stature in adolescents. In this condition, there is a delay in the onset of puberty, resulting in delayed growth spurt. The bone age is typically delayed compared to the chronological age. The appropriate management for constitutional growth delay is reassurance and follow-up. No further investigations or treatment are necessary at this time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
