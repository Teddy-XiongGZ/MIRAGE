    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-year-old boy with a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. The fact that the pain occurs every 1-2 months and lasts for a few hours suggests a recurrent condition. Given the absence of other symptoms and the normal physical examination findings, it is unlikely that this is a surgical emergency. Among the given options, the most likely congenital condition that would explain the patient's symptoms is Intestinal malrotation. Intestinal malrotation refers to an abnormal rotation of the intestines during fetal development, which can lead to intermittent episodes of abdominal pain. This condition is often associated with congenital heart disease, as mentioned in the patient's history. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents in the first few weeks of life with projectile vomiting and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium. Biliary cysts are rare congenital abnormalities that usually present with jaundice and abdominal pain. Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly of the pancreatic ducts that is typically asymptomatic, but can rarely cause recurrent abdominal pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Intestinal malrotation\"}"
