    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, ankle swelling, and bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema. These findings suggest a systemic cause of edema rather than a localized lymphatic obstruction. The widely split S2 that varies with respiration and the right bundle branch block on ECG are suggestive of a cardiac etiology. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema is increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, which can occur in conditions such as congestive heart failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
