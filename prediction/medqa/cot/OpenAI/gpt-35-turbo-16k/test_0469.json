    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 27-year-old woman presenting with shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain. These symptoms have been present for 2 months and started after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at a geology laboratory and visits Nigeria twice a year. Her last trip was 3 months ago. On examination, her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The chest x-ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Given the patient's history of travel to Arizona and Nigeria, as well as the presence of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and ocular symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is histoplasmosis, which is caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Sarcoidosis can also present with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, but it is less likely in this case due to the patient's travel history. Pulmonary tuberculosis and Hodgkin's lymphoma are less likely given the absence of other specific findings such as cough with hemoptysis or lymphadenopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Histoplasmosis\"}"
