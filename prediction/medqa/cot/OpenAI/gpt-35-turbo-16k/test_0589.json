    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden-onset, severe right flank pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts and a large simple cyst is seen on pelvic ultrasound. Doppler shows no flow in the right ovarian vein. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is ovarian torsion, which occurs when the ovary twists on its vascular pedicle, leading to compromised blood flow. The ligament most likely to be involved in ovarian torsion is the infundibulopelvic ligament, also known as the suspensory ligament of the ovary. This ligament contains the ovarian artery and vein, and torsion can lead to compromised venous outflow and subsequent ovarian ischemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
