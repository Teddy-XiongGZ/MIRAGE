    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a 10-day history of unsteady gait, frequent falls, and twitching of the extremities. Physical examination reveals bilateral saccadic eye movement in all directions and brief, involuntary muscle contractions of the trunk and limbs. There is also an ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a neuroblastoma, which is a malignant tumor that arises from neural crest cells. Neuroblastomas commonly present with symptoms related to the tumor mass and metastasis, such as abdominal mass, unsteady gait, and neurologic symptoms. The histopathologic examination of a neuroblastoma typically shows small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
