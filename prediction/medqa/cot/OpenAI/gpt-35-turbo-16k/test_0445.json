    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 43-year-old woman who underwent a laparoscopic Whipple's procedure three days ago. She now presents with swelling of her right leg, along with nausea and discomfort. The absence of pain, erythema, and pitting edema suggests that the swelling is not due to a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Additionally, the negative Homan's sign further supports this. The patient's vital signs are stable, and there are no abnormalities on lung auscultation. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a CT pulmonary angiography (Choice A) to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism (PE), as this is a potential complication following surgery. Compression ultrasonography (Choice B) is used to diagnose DVT, which is less likely in this case. D-dimer level (Choice C) is a screening test for PE, but it has a high false-positive rate and is not recommended in patients with recent surgery. Blood cultures (Choice D) would be indicated if there were signs of infection, such as fever or localized erythema, but these findings are not present in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
