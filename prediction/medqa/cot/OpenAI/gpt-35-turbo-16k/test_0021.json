Among the given options, the most likely cause of these symptoms is associated with 22q11 deletion. 22q11 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. It is associated with various congenital anomalies, including cardiac defects such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The high-pitched holosystolic murmur heard in this patient is consistent with a VSD, which is commonly seen in 22q11 deletion syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
