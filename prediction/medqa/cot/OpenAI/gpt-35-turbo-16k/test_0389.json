    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described, the patient has weakness in the left leg, which suggests a motor deficit. Additionally, there is a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity, as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. These findings indicate a lesion that affects the motor pathways on the left side and the sensory pathways on the right side. The anterior cord carries the motor pathways, pain, and temperature sensation, while the posterior cord carries the vibration sense and light touch. Therefore, the most likely lesion in this case is a right cord hemisection, which would result in weakness on the left side and sensory deficits on the right side.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
