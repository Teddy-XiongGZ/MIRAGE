    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of depressed mood and fatigue, along with weight gain. These symptoms are suggestive of depression. The fact that she is actively trying to quit smoking suggests that she may be experiencing nicotine withdrawal symptoms, which can contribute to her depressed mood and fatigue. The drug prescribed to treat her mood disturbance and support smoking cessation is likely an antidepressant. Antidepressants can have various side effects, including hypotension, urinary retention, tachycardia, and QTc prolongation. To determine which side effect is most likely, we need to consider the specific class of antidepressant that is being prescribed. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used for depression and smoking cessation. SSRIs are not known to cause hypotension or urinary retention. Tachycardia is a possible side effect of SSRIs, but it is less common. QTc prolongation is a potential side effect of some antidepressants, including certain SSRIs. Given the information provided, the most likely side effect of the prescribed drug is QTc prolongation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
