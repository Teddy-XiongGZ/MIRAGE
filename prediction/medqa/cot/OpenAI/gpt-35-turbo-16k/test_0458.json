    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the body requires increased oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. To meet this demand, the heart rate and blood pressure increase. In this case, the individual's heart rate and blood pressure increased immediately after stopping his run. This suggests that the change is a result of the body's response to exercise. The baroreceptor reflex is responsible for maintaining blood pressure within a normal range. It detects changes in blood pressure and adjusts the heart rate and blood vessel diameter to maintain homeostasis. However, in this case, the blood pressure increased after exercise, which suggests that the baroreceptor reflex is not the primary mechanism responsible for the change. Increased activation of the vagal nuclei refers to increased activity of the parasympathetic nervous system, which typically leads to a decrease in heart rate. However, in this case, the heart rate increased after exercise, suggesting that increased activation of the vagal nuclei is not the primary mechanism responsible for the change. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response, which includes increased heart rate and blood pressure. During exercise, sympathetic nervous system activation is expected to increase to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, sympathetic nervous system activation is the most likely mechanism responsible for the change in heart rate and blood pressure in this case. Vasopressin is a hormone released from the pituitary gland that acts to increase blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. However, in this case, the blood pressure increased after exercise, suggesting that vasopressin release is not the primary mechanism responsible for the change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Sympathetic nervous system activation\"}"
