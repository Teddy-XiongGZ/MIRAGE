    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, along with the isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle on MRI, suggest a possible obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The CSF flows from the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro). From the third ventricle, it then flows to the fourth ventricle through the cerebral aqueduct. Finally, it exits the fourth ventricle through the median aperture (also known as the foramen of Magendie) and the lateral apertures (also known as the foramina of Luschka) into the subarachnoid space. Given the isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle, the most likely cause of the obstruction is the blockade of the interventricular foramen (B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
