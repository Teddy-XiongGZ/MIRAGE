    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history and examination findings, the patient most likely has a radial head subluxation, also known as nursemaid's elbow. This is a common injury in young children and typically occurs when there is a sudden pull on the child's outstretched arm. The characteristic presentation includes refusal to use the affected limb, pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, and limited supination. The next step in management is reduction of the radial head subluxation. This can be achieved by performing the 'supination then maximal extension' maneuver, also known as the reduction maneuver. This maneuver involves supinating the forearm while simultaneously applying gentle pressure to extend the elbow. This maneuver is successful in approximately 85-95% of cases. If the reduction maneuver is unsuccessful, then radiographs may be considered to rule out other fractures or injuries. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Supination then maximal extension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
