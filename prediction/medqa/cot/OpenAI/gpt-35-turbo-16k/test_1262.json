    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with malaise, muscle cramps, nausea, and non-bloody watery stools. He has a history of similar symptoms in the past. On examination, he demonstrates sensitivity to bright light. The stool sample and culture reveal non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli. These findings are consistent with infection by Vibrio cholerae, which is the most likely pathogen in this case. Vibrio cholerae produces a virulence factor called cholera toxin, which is responsible for the symptoms of cholera. Cholera toxin acts by ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2, which leads to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and subsequent activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel. This results in increased chloride secretion into the intestinal lumen, leading to watery diarrhea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
