    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The correct method of transporting an amputated finger is to wrap it in moist gauze, put it in a plastic bag, and place it on ice. This method helps to preserve the finger and prevent further damage. Submerging the finger directly in ice water can cause tissue damage due to extreme cold temperatures. Wrapping the finger in moist gauze helps to keep it moist and prevent it from drying out. Placing the wrapped finger in a plastic bag helps to protect it from contamination. Finally, placing the bagged finger on ice helps to keep it cool and slow down the metabolic processes, which can help to preserve the finger until it can be reattached.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
