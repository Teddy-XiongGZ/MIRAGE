    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with generalized weakness, increased urination, increased thirst, fatigue, and constipation. These symptoms are suggestive of an electrolyte imbalance. The lab results show low potassium and low chloride levels, which are consistent with a renal tubular disorder. The elevated urinary calcium excretion suggests a calcium wasting disorder. The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, ruling out renal artery stenosis. Pheochromocytoma is unlikely as the patient does not have symptoms such as headache, palpitations, or sweating. The most likely diagnosis is Bartter's syndrome, which is characterized by a defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to electrolyte imbalances and calcium wasting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
