    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 29-year-old woman at 24 weeks' gestation who presents with vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain. The bleeding is associated with a tender, bruised cervix and a closed cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reassuring. The ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. Given these findings, the most likely cause of the antepartum bleeding in this patient is cervical trauma. The bruised cervix and closed cervical os suggest recent trauma to the cervix, which could be caused by sexual activity. The reassuring fetal heart rate and absence of other signs of placental abruption make premature separation of the placenta less likely. Pedunculated cervical growth and inflammation of the cervix are less likely causes in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Cervical trauma\"}"
