    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presentation of pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours suggests nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by increased permeability of the glomerular basement membrane, leading to loss of proteins in the urine. The loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membrane is a characteristic feature of minimal change disease, which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. To confirm the diagnosis of minimal change disease, we would expect to see selective albuminuria, which means that there is an increased loss of albumin in the urine while other proteins are relatively spared. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Selective albuminuria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
