    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient is a previously healthy young man who attended a bachelor party and lost several drinking games. The ECG shows a regular rhythm with narrow QRS complexes and an absence of P waves. This suggests a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) rather than a ventricular tachycardia. Among the choices given, the most likely diagnosis in this case is paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm with absent P waves. It can be triggered by excessive alcohol consumption, which is consistent with the patient's history of losing drinking games at the bachelor party.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
