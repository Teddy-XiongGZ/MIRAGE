    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn is presenting with symptoms of irritability, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. These symptoms are consistent with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which occurs when a newborn is exposed to drugs in utero and experiences withdrawal symptoms after birth. The most common cause of NAS is maternal use of opioids, such as heroin or prescription opioids. Opioids act as mu receptor agonists, which means they bind to and activate mu opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. This leads to the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters, resulting in the euphoric effects of opioids. When a pregnant woman uses opioids, these drugs can cross the placenta and reach the fetus, causing the fetus to become dependent on opioids. After birth, when the supply of opioids is suddenly cut off, the newborn experiences withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Mu receptor agonist.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
