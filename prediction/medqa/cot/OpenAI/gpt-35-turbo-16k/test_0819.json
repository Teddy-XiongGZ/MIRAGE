    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not attained menarche. This suggests a problem with her reproductive system. The examination shows normal breast development, which indicates that she has normal estrogen production. However, there is a blind vaginal pouch and no uterus or ovaries seen on ultrasonography. This suggests a problem with the development of the internal female reproductive organs. The presence of a firm, nontender left inguinal mass suggests the presence of a gonad, which is likely a testis. Based on these findings, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is Androgen insensitivity (D). Androgen insensitivity is a condition in which individuals with a 46,XY karyotype have normal or high levels of testosterone but are unable to respond to androgens due to a defect in the androgen receptor. This results in the development of external female genitalia and the absence of internal female reproductive organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
