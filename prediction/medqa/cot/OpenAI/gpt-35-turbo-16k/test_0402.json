    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center, which is suggestive of a drug reaction. The rash developed 2 days ago and has progressively worsened. Additionally, the patient had fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. These symptoms are consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. DRESS syndrome is most commonly associated with antiepileptic drugs, such as lamotrigine and valproate. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) and paroxetine are not typically associated with DRESS syndrome. Therefore, the most likely drug that the patient was prescribed is either lamotrigine or valproate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
