    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 45-year-old female presenting with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria. She has been taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The presence of gross hematuria and acute flank pain suggests a possible renal cause. The fact that she has been taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin raises concern for drug-induced renal injury. The normal blood pressure and temperature make acute pyelonephritis less likely. The absence of palpable flank masses makes renal cell carcinoma less likely. The presence of proteinuria suggests renal involvement. Given the history of high-dose acetaminophen and aspirin use, the most likely diagnosis is papillary necrosis, which is a known complication of long-term NSAID use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Papillary necrosis\"}"
