The intraoperative findings confirm a single perforation in the terminal ileum, which has been successfully repaired. The patient is now in the postoperative period and is being managed in the intensive care unit. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.44, pO2 of 54 mm Hg, pCO2 of 31 mm Hg, and HCO3- of 22 mm Hg. These values indicate respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia.
