    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of lethargy and irritability between meals, along with normocytic anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and decreased haptoglobin, which are suggestive of hemolytic anemia. The negative Coombs test rules out immune-mediated hemolysis. The normal red blood cell osmotic fragility gap suggests that the hemolysis is not due to membrane defects. Given the family history of a brother requiring blood transfusions, it is likely that the patient has a hereditary enzyme deficiency causing hemolysis. The fact that the enzyme deficiency is allosterically inhibited suggests that the enzyme is regulated by an allosteric inhibitor. Among the given choices, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a well-known allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), which is the key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
