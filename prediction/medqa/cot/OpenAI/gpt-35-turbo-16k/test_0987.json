    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, including jerking movements, delayed developmental milestones, pale appearance, blue eyes, musty odor, and poor eye contact, are suggestive of a metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites. The musty odor is due to the accumulation of phenylacetate. The most effective treatment for PKU is dietary restriction of phenylalanine, which should be started early in life to prevent neurologic damage. Therefore, the answer choice that would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms is B. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
