    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a progressively growing mass in his axilla, along with recurrent episodes of low-grade fever and weight loss. Physical examination reveals lymphadenopathy in multiple areas. The serum calcium concentration is elevated, and the PTH concentration is low. The lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. These findings are consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma. In Hodgkin lymphoma, the malignant cells can produce PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), which can lead to hypercalcemia. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings is the production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
