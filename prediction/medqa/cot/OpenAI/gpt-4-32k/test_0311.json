    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of blood in stools and pale conjunctivae, along with the lab results showing low hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume, suggest that he is suffering from anemia due to chronic blood loss. The colonoscopy findings of a polypoid mass in the ascending colon further suggest that this blood loss is due to a colorectal neoplasm. The pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasms is often associated with mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway, which leads to impaired degradation of \u03b2-catenin. When \u03b2-catenin is not degraded, it accumulates in the cell and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of genes that promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell death.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Impaired degradation of \u03b2-catenin\"}"
