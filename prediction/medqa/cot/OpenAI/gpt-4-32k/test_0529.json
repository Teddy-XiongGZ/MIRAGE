    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye, along with the fundoscopic findings of a pale, white retina with a cherry-red spot at the macula, are classic for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). This condition is essentially a stroke of the eye, often due to an embolus from a carotid plaque or the heart. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, and other atherosclerotic diseases, all of which this patient has. Retinal detachment usually presents with flashes, floaters, and a 'curtain coming down' visual field loss. Acute angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with severe eye pain, nausea, and a red, hard eye, none of which are present in this patient. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy would typically present with optic disc edema, which is not seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Central retinal artery occlusion\"}"
