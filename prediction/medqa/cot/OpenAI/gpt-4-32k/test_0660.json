    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been having trouble sleeping for a long time, which has been affecting his health. He is also worried about his financial situation if he were to get sick. He arrived early for his appointment due to fear of missing it. He is irritable, tense, and somewhat inattentive during the interview. These symptoms suggest that he is constantly worried and anxious about different aspects of his life. This is not a normal worry as it is affecting his daily life and health. It is also not an adjustment disorder as there is no identifiable stressor that he is trying to adjust to. Social anxiety is characterized by fear of social situations, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is generalized anxiety disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
