    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Point D in the graph likely represents a time after the meal has been consumed and the stomach is emptying. At this point, the stomach would want to decrease acid secretion to prevent damage to the stomach lining in the absence of food. D cells in the stomach and duodenum secrete somatostatin, which inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, increased activity of D cells would contribute to the decrease in stomach acid secretion seen at point D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increased activity of D cells\"}"
