    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed after sun exposure suggest a photosensitive reaction. Photosensitivity can be caused by certain medications, including antibiotics like tetracyclines, which include demeclocycline. This drug is known to cause photosensitivity reactions, which occur when the drug absorbs UV light and then releases it into the skin, causing cell injury. This is not related to mast cell degranulation, which is associated with allergic reactions. It's also not related to the formation of drug-induced autoantibodies, which would cause a different set of symptoms. Accumulation of porphobilinogen is associated with porphyria, a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the nervous system and skin, not photosensitivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
