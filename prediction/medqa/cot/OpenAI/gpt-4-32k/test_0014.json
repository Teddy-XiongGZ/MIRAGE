    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process described in the question is known as reassortment. Reassortment is a process that happens when two or more different strains of a virus, or different types of a virus, infect the same cell and interact during replication to create a new subtype. This process is most common in viruses with segmented genomes, such as influenza. Among the options, only Rotavirus has a segmented genome, which makes it capable of undergoing reassortment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Rotavirus\"}"
