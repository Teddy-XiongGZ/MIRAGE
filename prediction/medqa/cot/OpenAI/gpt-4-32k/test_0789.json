    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which is characteristic of Torsades de Pointes. This is a type of ventricular tachycardia that is often associated with a prolonged QT interval. The patient's current medication, azithromycin, is known to prolong the QT interval, which can lead to Torsades de Pointes. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope is a prolonged QT interval.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Prolonged QT interval\"}"
