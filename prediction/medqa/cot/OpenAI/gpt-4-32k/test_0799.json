    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and ECG findings suggest that she is experiencing a myocardial infarction, specifically an anterior wall MI given the ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V3, V4, V5, and V6. This has led to a decrease in her blood pressure and an increase in her heart rate, indicating that her body is trying to compensate for the decreased cardiac output. To improve her hemodynamic status, we would want to increase her cardiac output. The beta-1 adrenergic receptor, when stimulated, increases heart rate and contractility, which would increase cardiac output and improve her hemodynamic status.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Beta-1 adrenergic receptor\"}"
