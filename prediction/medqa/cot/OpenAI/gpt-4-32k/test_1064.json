    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck, along with occasional abdominal pain, are suggestive of angioedema. The fact that these symptoms have been present her whole life and that her mother and maternal aunt have a similar condition suggests a hereditary disorder. The extremely low C1-inhibitor levels further support this, as C1-inhibitor is a protein that helps regulate the immune system and its deficiency is associated with hereditary angioedema. Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are all inherited disorders, but they present with different symptoms and are not associated with low C1-inhibitor levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hereditary angioedema\"}"
