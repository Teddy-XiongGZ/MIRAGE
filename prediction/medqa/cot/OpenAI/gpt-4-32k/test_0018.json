    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sharp, severe chest pain that increases when lying down and improves with leaning forward, along with the physical exam finding of a scratching sound over the left sternal border, are indicative of pericarditis. The ECG would likely show ST segment elevations in all leads, which is also consistent with pericarditis. Pericarditis is typically treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine to reduce inflammation and pain. Indomethacin is an NSAID, but ibuprofen is usually preferred due to its better side effect profile. Pericardiocentesis and pericardiectomy are invasive procedures that are typically reserved for severe cases, such as cardiac tamponade, which this patient does not appear to have. Therefore, the optimal therapy for this patient would be ibuprofen and colchicine, with the addition of a proton pump inhibitor like omeprazole to protect against gastrointestinal side effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole\"}"
