    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and occupational exposure suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which is an allergic reaction to inhaled organic dusts. In this case, the patient is likely reacting to bird proteins. A chest X-ray showing diffuse haziness in both lower lung fields is consistent with this diagnosis. A negative PPD skin test rules out tuberculosis. Thoracocentesis is not indicated as there is no evidence of pleural effusion. Inhaled beclomethasone is used for asthma and COPD, which do not fit the patient's presentation. Isoniazid is used for tuberculosis, which has been ruled out. The most appropriate treatment for hypersensitivity pneumonitis is avoidance of the offending agent, in this case, birds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Avoid exposure to birds\"}"
