    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms of lethargy, decreased feeding, and easy bruising suggest a systemic illness. The presence of diffuse petechiae and bruising is indicative of a bleeding disorder. Given the child's age and the fact that she was born at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care, it is likely that she did not receive the standard prophylactic vitamin K injection at birth, which is given to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding.
