    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe headache, transient vision loss, blurry vision, and tinnitus, along with her history of obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome, suggest a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. This condition is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, often in the absence of a space-occupying lesion, and is more common in obese women of childbearing age. A normal head CT rules out other causes of increased intracranial pressure such as a brain tumor. The best next step in management would be a lumbar puncture, which can confirm the diagnosis by showing elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure and rule out other causes of the symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lumbar puncture\"}"
