    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of gait difficulty, urinary urgency, and cognitive impairment are suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. The gait disturbance is typically the first symptom and is characterized by a broad-based, magnetic gait. Urinary incontinence is usually present as well, often with a sense of urgency. Cognitive impairment in NPH is typically subcortical in nature, with early loss of executive function, attention, and psychomotor speed. The treatment of choice for NPH is ventricular shunting, which can improve symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Ventricular shunting\"}"
