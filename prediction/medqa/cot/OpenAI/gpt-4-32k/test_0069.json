    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and a new liver nodule has been found on ultrasound. The CT scan shows a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase, which is a typical feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In patients with cirrhosis, any new liver nodule >1 cm should be considered HCC until proven otherwise. The next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis. Liver biopsy is usually not necessary if the imaging is characteristic of HCC, as in this case. Surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation are potential treatment options for HCC, but the choice among these depends on the patient's liver function, the extent of the tumor, and the patient's overall health. Therefore, the next step would be to refer the patient for further evaluation and treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Refer for surgical resection\"}"
