    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the confirmatory test for HIV. The initial screening test for HIV is usually an enzyme immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and p24 antigen. If this test is positive, a confirmatory test is performed. The confirmatory test is an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. This test can differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Southwestern blot and Northern blot are not used in the diagnosis of HIV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay\"}"
