    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, which is defined as blood loss of >500 mL after vaginal delivery. The most common cause is uterine atony, a condition in which the uterus fails to contract after the delivery of the baby. The first-line treatment for uterine atony is uterotonic agents, such as oxytocin, which stimulate uterine contractions to control bleeding. Hysterectomy is a last resort when all other measures fail. Elevating the posterior fornix is not a standard treatment for postpartum hemorrhage. Red blood cell transfusion may be necessary if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable or if the bleeding cannot be controlled, but it is not the first step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Intravenous oxytocin\"}"
