    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and signs, such as swelling and severe pain in the lower leg, positive fibrin split products, and ultrasonography showing incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow, are indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's risk factors include obesity (BMI 30.7 kg/m2), smoking, and a family history of pulmonary embolism. Among the options provided, Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited hypercoagulable state associated with DVT. It is characterized by resistance to activated protein C, leading to increased thrombin generation and a prothrombotic state. Antithrombin III deficiency, Protein C deficiency, and Antiphospholipid syndrome are also associated with hypercoagulability, but they are less common than Factor V Leiden.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Factor V Leiden\"}"
