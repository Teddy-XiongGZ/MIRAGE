    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include sudden onset speech changes and right arm weakness. The speech changes described, where the patient's speech became distorted with random and disconnected words, suggest a language disorder known as expressive aphasia, also known as Broca's aphasia. This condition is typically caused by damage to Broca's area, which is located in the frontal lobe of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right-handed individuals. The right arm weakness suggests a motor deficit, which would also be consistent with damage to the frontal lobe, as this is where the primary motor cortex is located. Therefore, the symptoms would best be explained by damage to the left frontal lobe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Left frontal lobe\"}"
