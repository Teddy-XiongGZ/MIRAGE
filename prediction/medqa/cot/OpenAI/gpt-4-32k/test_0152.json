    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where a family is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. This is indicative of an influenza virus. The son, however, is not showing any symptoms. The most likely explanation for this is that he has immunity against the virus. The immunity against influenza virus is primarily mediated by serum antibodies against hemagglutinin, a surface protein of the virus that is responsible for binding to host cells. The other options are less likely. Downregulation of ICAM-1 expression is associated with decreased susceptibility to rhinovirus, not influenza. Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions are not a primary defense against influenza. A homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene confers resistance to HIV, not influenza.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
