    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's skin color change to yellow/orange and the significantly elevated total and direct bilirubin levels suggest jaundice, which is often a sign of liver disease. The liver is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin, a process that involves the enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase. A decrease in the activity of this enzyme would lead to an accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, causing jaundice. The other options do not directly relate to the patient's symptoms. Sofosbuvir is a medication used to treat hepatitis C, but there's no indication of this disease in the patient. Hyperpigmentation of the liver is not typically associated with jaundice. Increased consumption of beta-carotene can cause a yellow-orange skin discoloration, but it does not cause jaundice or elevated bilirubin levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity\"}"
