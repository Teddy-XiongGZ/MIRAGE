    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ribosome does not have the ability to recognize the specific amino acid attached to the tRNA. It only recognizes the anticodon of the tRNA, which matches with the codon on the mRNA. Therefore, if a tRNA is mischarged with the wrong amino acid, the ribosome will still incorporate it into the growing peptide chain as long as the anticodon matches with the codon on the mRNA. The ribosome does not have the ability to remove the amino acid from the tRNA, nor does it have the ability to degrade the tRNA. The lysyl-tRNA synthetase is responsible for charging the tRNA with the correct amino acid, but it does not have the ability to remove a mischarged amino acid once it has been attached.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
