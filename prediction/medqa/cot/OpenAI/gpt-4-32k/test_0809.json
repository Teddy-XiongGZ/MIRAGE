    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden severe joint pain, redness, swelling, warmth, and fever are suggestive of septic arthritis, which is a joint infection. This is further supported by the elevated serum CRP and procalcitonin levels, which are markers of inflammation and bacterial infection, respectively. In septic arthritis, the synovial fluid analysis typically shows a high white blood cell (WBC) count due to the immune response to the infection, a high percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) as they are the primary responders to bacterial infections, and a low viscosity due to the presence of inflammatory proteins and degradation of hyaluronic acid by bacterial enzymes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low\"}"
