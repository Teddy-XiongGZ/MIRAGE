    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of cleft lip, recurrent upper respiratory infections, infertility, and notably, the absence of heart sounds at the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line (indicating dextrocardia) suggest Kartagener syndrome. Kartagener syndrome is a subtype of primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by defective ciliary structure and function. The cilia are composed of microtubules, which are organized by dynein arms. Dynein, a retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein, is responsible for the movement of cilia and flagella. Therefore, a mutation in this protein class would most likely be responsible for the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein\"}"
