    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of bilateral hand tremor that is most prominent during activities such as brushing teeth or preparing coffee, and improves as the day progresses, are suggestive of essential tremor. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder that often runs in families and typically presents with a bilateral, high-frequency tremor that is most noticeable during voluntary movement. Although the patient has a family history of Parkinson's disease, his symptoms are not consistent with this condition, as Parkinson's typically presents with a resting tremor that is unilateral initially. The first-line treatment for essential tremor is either a beta-blocker, such as propranolol, or an anticonvulsant, such as primidone. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that can be used for tremor but is not first-line due to the risk of dependence. Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, which is not indicated in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Propranolol\"}"
