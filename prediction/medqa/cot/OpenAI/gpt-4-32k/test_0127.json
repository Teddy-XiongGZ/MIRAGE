    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a class of immune cells that can lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. This is a characteristic of natural killer cells, which are part of the innate immune system and can recognize and kill virus-infected cells, tumor cells, and other abnormal cells. They do not require prior sensitization to perform their function. Bone marrow-derived macrophages, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and band neutrophils all require some form of activation or priming before they can effectively respond to pathogens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Natural killer cells\"}"
