    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of urinary hesitancy and nocturia, along with the finding of an enlarged prostate on digital rectal exam, suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The slightly elevated PSA level can also be seen in BPH. Clonidine is used for hypertension, not BPH. Dihydrotestosterone is a hormone that can actually contribute to prostate enlargement, so it would not be used to treat BPH. Furosemide is a diuretic used to treat fluid overload conditions like heart failure, not BPH. Finasteride, however, is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, reducing prostate size and improving symptoms in BPH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Finasteride\"}"
