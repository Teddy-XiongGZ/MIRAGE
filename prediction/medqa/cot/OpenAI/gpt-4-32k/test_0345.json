    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of generalized pruritus, raised, erythematous plaques on the skin, clear liquid discharge from his nose, and sneezing that began suddenly after eating at a seafood restaurant suggest an allergic reaction, likely due to seafood. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be an antihistamine, which can help alleviate these symptoms. Diphenhydramine and Fexofenadine are both antihistamines, but Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation. It also has anticholinergic effects, which can precipitate narrow-angle glaucoma, a condition the patient had an episode of four months ago. Fexofenadine, on the other hand, is a second-generation antihistamine that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and has no anticholinergic effects, making it a safer choice for this patient. Vitamin K is used for coagulation disorders and Calamine lotion is a topical treatment for itching, but neither would be the most appropriate treatment for this patient's systemic allergic reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fexofenadine\"}"
