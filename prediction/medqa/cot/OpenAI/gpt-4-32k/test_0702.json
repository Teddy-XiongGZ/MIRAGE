    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of lowering the cut-off point for a screening test. In this case, the test is for tuberculosis and the cut-off point is the size of the skin elevation following an intradermal injection. If the cut-off point is lowered, it means that more people will test positive for the disease. This will increase the number of true positives and false positives. The negative predictive value is the proportion of negative results that are truly negative. If more people are testing positive, then fewer people are testing negative, which could increase the negative predictive value because the proportion of true negatives could increase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Negative predictive value\"}"
