    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of abdominal distention, fatigue, night sweats, post-prandial fullness, and recurrent nonbilious vomiting, along with the physical examination findings of hepatosplenomegaly, shifting dullness, and multiple nonblanching maculae, suggest a systemic disease. The CT scan findings of mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum further support this. The Ki-67 nuclear antigen is a marker of cell proliferation, and a proliferation index of >99% is highly suggestive of a malignancy. The structure indicated by the arrows in the biopsy specimen from an enlarged mesenteric lymph node is most likely a type of cell involved in the malignancy. Given the systemic nature of the disease and the high proliferation index, the most likely cell type is a B lymphocyte, which is involved in lymphomas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. B lymphocytes\"}"
