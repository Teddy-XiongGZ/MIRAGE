    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with signs of preterm labor, which is defined as regular uterine contractions and cervical changes prior to 37 weeks of gestation. The patient's cervix is dilated to 5 cm and 70% effaced, which indicates that she is in active labor. The goal in this situation is to delay delivery to allow for fetal lung maturity. Misoprostol is used for labor induction and dilation and evacuation is a procedure used in the second trimester for pregnancy termination, so these options are not appropriate. Allowing vaginal delivery is not the best choice as the fetus is preterm. Nifedipine is a tocolytic agent used to suppress preterm labor, so this would be the most appropriate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Initiate nifedipine therapy\"}"
