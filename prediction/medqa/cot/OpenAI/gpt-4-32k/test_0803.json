    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of slurred speech and arm weakness that resolved completely are suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), often referred to as a 'mini-stroke'. TIAs are often caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain, which can result in temporary symptoms similar to a stroke. Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, she is at a high risk for stroke. An initial head CT scan did not show any acute changes, so the next step would be to further evaluate the patient's brain with an MRI, which is more sensitive than a CT scan for detecting ischemic changes, especially in the early stages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
