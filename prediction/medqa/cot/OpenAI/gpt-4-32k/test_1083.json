    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history and symptoms are suggestive of a stress fracture, which is a common overuse injury in military recruits due to increased physical activity. Stress fractures are often seen in the metatarsals and are characterized by pain that worsens with activity and may persist at rest. On examination, there may be localized tenderness and swelling. X-ray findings in stress fractures may be subtle or even absent in the first 2-3 weeks, but may later show callus formation and loss of cortical density, as in this patient. The most appropriate next step in management of stress fractures is rest to allow the bone to heal, and analgesics for pain control. More invasive procedures or further imaging are not necessary at this point.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Rest and acetaminophen\"}"
