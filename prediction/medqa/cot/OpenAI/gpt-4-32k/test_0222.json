    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion, abdominal distention, ascites, engorged periumbilical veins, and bilateral pitting edema are suggestive of congestive heart failure. The most likely cause of heart failure in this patient with diabetes is diabetic cardiomyopathy. Metformin is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and it is known to have cardioprotective effects. The mechanism of action of metformin involves the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which leads to increased expression of GLUT-4, a glucose transporter, on the cell surface. This increases glucose uptake into the cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased gene expression of GLUT-4\"}"
