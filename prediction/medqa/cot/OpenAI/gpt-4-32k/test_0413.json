    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a high serum sodium level (154 mEq/L), which indicates hypernatremia. This condition is often due to water loss, which is consistent with the patient's high drainage output and dry skin and mucous membranes. The patient's mental status changes (difficulty arousing) can also be attributed to hypernatremia. The best treatment for hypernatremia is to replace the free water deficit. Oral replacement is preferred if the patient can tolerate it, but given the patient's postoperative status and altered mental status, intravenous replacement is more appropriate. 5% dextrose in water (D5W) is a hypotonic solution that can provide free water and correct hypernatremia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 5% dextrose IV\"}"
