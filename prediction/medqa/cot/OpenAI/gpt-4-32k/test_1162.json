    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs that help rid the body of toxins, waste and other unwanted materials. The primary function of the lymphatic system is to transport lymph, a fluid containing infection-fighting white blood cells, throughout the body. The lymphatic drainage of the ovaries is via the lumbar lymph nodes. The lymph from the lumbar lymph nodes drains into the cisterna chyli. From the cisterna chyli, the lymph drains into the thoracic duct, which is the largest lymphatic vessel in the body. The thoracic duct drains into the left subclavian vein, which then enters the systemic circulation. From the systemic circulation, the cancer cells can metastasize to any part of the body, including the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation\"}"
