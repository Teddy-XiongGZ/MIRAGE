    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is at 24 weeks gestation and her pregnancy has been normal so far. The oral glucose challenge test is typically performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation to screen for gestational diabetes, but there is no indication that this is necessary at this time. Cardiotocography is used to monitor the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions, but again, there is no indication for this at this time. A swab for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) culture is typically performed between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation. The Tdap vaccine, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, is recommended for pregnant women between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation, regardless of when they last received it. This is to maximize the passive antibody transfer to the newborn. Therefore, none of the options are appropriate at this exact time, but the Tdap vaccination would be the next appropriate step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tdap vaccination\"}"
