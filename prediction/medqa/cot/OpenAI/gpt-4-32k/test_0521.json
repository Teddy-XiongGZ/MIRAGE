    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of crushing chest pain, radiating to the left side of the neck and the left arm, along with nausea, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, are indicative of a myocardial infarction. The ECG and elevated troponins confirm this diagnosis. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and smoking further increase his risk for coronary artery disease. The initial management of acute myocardial infarction includes aspirin, clopidogrel, nitroglycerin, and morphine, which have already been administered. The next step in management should be reperfusion therapy, which can be achieved through percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy. PCI is the preferred method of reperfusion if it can be performed within 90 minutes of first medical contact. Thrombolytic therapy is generally reserved for situations where PCI is not available or cannot be performed within the recommended time frame. Coronary artery bypass graft is usually reserved for patients with left main disease or multivessel disease not amenable to PCI. Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor that can be used in the long-term management of patients after myocardial infarction, but it is not the immediate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Percutaneous coronary intervention\"}"
