    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a complex ethical situation. The patient is in a comatose state and unable to make decisions for himself. The daughter, who is the next of kin, is refusing a life-saving operation due to personal reasons. The patient has no written advanced directive, so we cannot know his wishes in this situation. The daughter's refusal is not based on the patient's best interest, but on personal feelings. Therefore, it is not appropriate to follow the daughter's wishes in this case. Reporting the daughter to the police is not appropriate either, as she has not committed a crime. Contacting another family member for consent could be an option, but it is not guaranteed that they would have the patient's best interest in mind either. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to refer this case to the court, where a neutral third party can make a decision based on the patient's best interest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Refer this case to the court\"}"
