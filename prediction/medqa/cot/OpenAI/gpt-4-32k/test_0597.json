    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Picornaviruses are non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. They are resistant to many common disinfectants, including alcohol-based ones like ethyl alcohol and chlorhexidine. However, they are susceptible to disinfectants that can denature proteins and disrupt the viral capsid, such as sodium hypochlorite and sulfuric acid. Between these two, sodium hypochlorite is more commonly used as a disinfectant due to its safety profile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Sodium hypochlorite\"}"
