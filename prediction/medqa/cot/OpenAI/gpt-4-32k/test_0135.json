    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CD8 is a cell surface marker found on cytotoxic T cells. These cells play a crucial role in the immune response by identifying and killing infected cells. The protein that binds to CD8 is most likely the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecule. This molecule binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the T cell receptor on cytotoxic T cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel\"}"
