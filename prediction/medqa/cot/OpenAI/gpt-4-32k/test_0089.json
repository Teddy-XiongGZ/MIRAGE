    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, fatigue, and physical findings of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with bruits, along with the lab findings of low TSH and high FT4, suggest hyperthyroidism. The treatment options for hyperthyroidism include methimazole, propylthiouracil, radioiodine therapy, and thyroidectomy. However, methimazole is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of embryopathy. Radioiodine therapy is also contraindicated in pregnancy as it can cross the placenta and affect the fetal thyroid gland. Thyroidectomy is usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed or are contraindicated. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient, who is in her first trimester of pregnancy, is propylthiouracil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Propylthiouracil\"}"
