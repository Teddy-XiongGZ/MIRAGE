His physical examination shows reduced breath sounds over the left lung base, which is a common finding in atelectasis. Atelectasis is a common postoperative complication and can occur due to a variety of reasons such as anesthesia, shallow breathing, or immobility. The patient's other symptoms and history do not strongly suggest the other options. Asthma exacerbation would likely present with wheezing, which is not mentioned. Pneumonitis would typically present with fever and leukocytosis, which are also not present. Pulmonary embolism is a possibility given the recent surgery, but the patient's calves are soft and nontender, and he does not have tachycardia or hypoxia, which are common in PE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
