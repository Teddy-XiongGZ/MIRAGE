    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of alcohol use, confusion, difficulty with memory and coordination, and nystagmus suggest a diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a condition caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency often seen in chronic alcoholics. The elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is also a common finding in chronic alcohol use and can be due to direct toxic effect of alcohol on the bone marrow or associated folate deficiency. The initial treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy is intravenous thiamine. Naltrexone is used for alcohol dependence, but it's not the initial treatment for this acute presentation. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurologic symptoms, but it's not the most likely cause in this case. Intravenous glucose can precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy in a thiamine-deficient patient, so it's not the appropriate initial treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Intravenous thiamine\"}"
