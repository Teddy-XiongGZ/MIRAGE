    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters, multiple hematomas, and a low platelet count suggest a bleeding disorder. The normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time rule out a coagulation factor deficiency, which excludes option A. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with thrombosis, which is characterized by excess circulating thrombin, so option C can be ruled out. Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation, option D, typically leads to thrombosis rather than bleeding. The most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets, option B. This mechanism is seen in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a condition characterized by low platelet count and increased risk of bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
