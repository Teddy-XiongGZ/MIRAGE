    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden breathlessness, sharp chest pain with inspiration, tachycardia, and pain in the right calf on dorsiflexion are suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, likely secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given his recent surgery and prolonged bed rest. The first step in managing a patient with suspected pulmonary embolism is to stabilize the patient and start anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation. Fondaparinux is a type of anticoagulant that can be used in this situation. Inferior vena cava filter is usually reserved for patients who cannot receive anticoagulation or have failed anticoagulation. Ventilation-perfusion scan is a diagnostic test for pulmonary embolism, but it should not delay the initiation of anticoagulation in a patient with high clinical suspicion. Lower extremity doppler can be used to confirm the presence of DVT, but again, it should not delay the initiation of anticoagulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Subcutaneous fondaparinux\"}"
