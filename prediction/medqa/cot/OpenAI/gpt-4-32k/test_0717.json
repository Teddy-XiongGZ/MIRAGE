    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has chronic kidney disease and is on dialysis. In chronic kidney disease, the kidneys are unable to convert vitamin D to its active form, and they are also unable to excrete phosphate. Both of these factors lead to hypocalcemia, which in turn stimulates the parathyroid glands to secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The increased PTH leads to increased bone resorption, which can lead to fractures, such as the one seen in this patient. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a state of excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone after long-term secondary hyperparathyroidism and resulting in hypercalcemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by an adenoma of the parathyroid glands and is characterized by hypercalcemia. Elder abuse is a serious condition, but there is no evidence of it in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Secondary hyperparathyroidism\"}"
