    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden severe pain in the great toe, along with the history of severe joint pain, and the high serum uric acid level, suggest a diagnosis of gout. Gout is a condition characterized by hyperuricemia and the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. The most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for gout is a medication that reduces the production of uric acid or increases its excretion. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol, reduce the production of uric acid by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is involved in the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition is the inhibition of xanthine oxidase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase\"}"
