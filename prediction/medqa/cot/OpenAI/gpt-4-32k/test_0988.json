    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The researcher's null hypothesis would have been that there is no association between low birth weight and obesity. He rejects this null hypothesis based on his study results, which show a p-value of 0.049. This p-value is less than 0.05, which is the common threshold for statistical significance in many fields, including medical research. Therefore, he concludes that there is a statistically significant association between low birth weight and obesity. However, rejecting the null hypothesis does not guarantee that the alternative hypothesis is true. There is always a chance of making a type 1 error, which is rejecting a true null hypothesis. The researcher cannot be 100% certain that his conclusion is correct, even though the p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, a type 1 error could have been made.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
