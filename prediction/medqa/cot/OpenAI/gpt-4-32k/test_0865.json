    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has just undergone surgery and was extubated. However, he became unresponsive shortly after and his oxygen saturation is significantly low, despite being put on a non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%. This suggests that he is not able to maintain his airway or adequately ventilate on his own. A tracheostomy is a more invasive procedure and is not typically the first step in managing acute respiratory failure. BiPAP is a non-invasive ventilation method, but it requires patient cooperation and would not be suitable for an unresponsive patient. Continuing with the non-rebreather mask is not improving his oxygenation. Therefore, the best next step would be to secure his airway and provide adequate ventilation by reintubating him.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Reintubate\"}"
