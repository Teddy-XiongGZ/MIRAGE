    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's prematurity, rapid breathing, hypoxia, and chest x-ray findings of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities are suggestive of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is caused by surfactant deficiency, which leads to alveolar collapse. Histologically, this is characterized by the presence of hyaline membranes lining the alveoli. Bilateral pleural effusions would be more indicative of a condition like congestive heart failure. Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture would suggest a bacterial infection, which is not indicated by the symptoms and findings. Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning would suggest meconium aspiration syndrome, which is not consistent with the clinical picture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy\"}"
