    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of right-sided back pain, nausea, dark urine, and alternating episodes of decreased and increased urine output are suggestive of a kidney stone. The presence of envelope-shaped crystals in the urine and the CT scan findings confirm this diagnosis. Envelope-shaped crystals are characteristic of calcium oxalate stones, the most common type of kidney stone. The patient's history of Crohn disease and small bowel resection is significant because these conditions can lead to malabsorption of fatty acids. When fatty acids are not absorbed, they bind to calcium in the gut, leaving oxalate free to be absorbed and excreted in the urine. This increases the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. The other options, such as parathyroid gland adenoma and excess vitamin D, can also lead to kidney stones, but they cause hypercalcemia and increased calcium excretion in the urine, which is not indicated in this case. High urine pH can lead to the formation of other types of stones (e.g., struvite, calcium phosphate), but not calcium oxalate stones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Malabsorption of fatty acids\"}"
