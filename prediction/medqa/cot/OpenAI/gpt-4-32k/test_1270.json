    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is suffering from insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling asleep and daytime fatigue. Diphenhydramine (choice A) is an antihistamine that can cause drowsiness and could potentially help with sleep, but it's not the best first-line treatment for insomnia due to its side effects. Drinking alcohol before bedtime (choice C) can actually disrupt sleep patterns and is not a healthy or effective solution for insomnia. Scheduled afternoon naps (choice D) could potentially disrupt the patient's sleep cycle further, making it harder for him to fall asleep at night. However, exercising in the evening (choice B) can make it harder to fall asleep, as exercise can increase alertness and arousal. Therefore, stopping evening exercise could potentially help the patient fall asleep more easily at night.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Stop evening exercise\"}"
