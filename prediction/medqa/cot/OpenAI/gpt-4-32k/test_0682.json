    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of asthma, recurrent pneumonia, and the presence of 'glove-finger shadows' on chest radiograph suggest the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). This condition is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus species, commonly seen in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. Symptoms include worsening asthma, recurrent pneumonia, and expectoration of brown mucus plugs. The 'glove-finger shadows' on chest radiograph are due to mucus impaction within the bronchi. Elevated IgE levels are also consistent with this diagnosis. The first-line treatment for ABPA is corticosteroids, which help to reduce inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Prednisone\"}"
