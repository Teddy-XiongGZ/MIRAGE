The high serum osmolality and low urine osmolality further support this diagnosis, as they indicate that the patient's body is not properly reabsorbing water from the urine, leading to a high concentration of solutes in the blood and a low concentration in the urine. The patient's history of lithium use is also significant, as lithium is known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a form of the disease that results from the kidneys' resistance to ADH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
