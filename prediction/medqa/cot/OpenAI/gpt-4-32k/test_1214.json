    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of pain in the right lower abdomen, generalized fatigue, decreasing urinary output, and increased creatinine concentration suggest a problem with the transplanted kidney. The biopsy shows tubulitis, which is inflammation of the tubules in the kidney. This is a common finding in acute cellular rejection of a transplanted kidney, which is mediated by recipient T-cells. The negative C4d staining rules out antibody-mediated rejection, which would be caused by newly formed anti-HLA antibodies. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is recipient T-cells in the graft.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Recipient T-cells in the graft\"}"
