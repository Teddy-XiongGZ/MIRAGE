    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been diagnosed with HIV and syphilis. His CD4 count is 175, which is below the normal range of 500-1500 cells/mm3, indicating a weakened immune system. The RPR test is a screening test for syphilis, and a positive result is confirmed by a more specific test, the FTA-ABS. The patient's RPR titer is 1:64, which is high, suggesting an active infection. The patient does not have any neurological symptoms, which would suggest neurosyphilis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends treating patients with HIV and syphilis with three weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G, regardless of the stage of syphilis. Follow-up titers should be obtained at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months to ensure the treatment is effective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
