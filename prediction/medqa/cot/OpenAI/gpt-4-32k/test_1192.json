This disorder often leads to self-imposed starvation and excessive weight loss. The first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa is psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT helps patients understand and change thought patterns that lead to harmful behaviors and feelings. In-patient psychiatric therapy may be necessary in severe cases, but it's not the first-line treatment.
