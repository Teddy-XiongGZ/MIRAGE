    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur in various forms. The patient's ethnicity and lifestyle can provide clues as to which type of melanoma she is most at risk for. Desmoplastic and nodular melanomas are more common in individuals with a history of sun exposure or fair skin, neither of which applies to this patient. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type of melanoma, but it is also more common in individuals with fair skin. Acral lentiginous melanoma, on the other hand, is more common in people of color and often occurs on the palms, soles, or under the nails. Given this patient's ethnicity and lack of significant sun exposure, she would be at greatest risk for acral lentiginous melanoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Acral lentiginous\"}"
