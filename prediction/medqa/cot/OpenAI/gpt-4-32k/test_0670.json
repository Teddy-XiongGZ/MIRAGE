    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that is bactericidal at high concentrations and bacteriostatic at low concentrations. It works by disrupting the cell membrane of bacteria, leading to leakage of intracellular components and cell death. It does not work by damaging the cell wall through free radical release, nor does it attack free-sulfur amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids within the bacteria. Its activity is not greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter and it does not depend on pH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Bactericidal at low concentrations\"}"
