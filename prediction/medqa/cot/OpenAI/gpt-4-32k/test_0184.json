    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of forgetfulness, difficulty with daily activities, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities are suggestive of a depressive syndrome. This is further supported by the findings of psychomotor retardation and blunted affect on mental status examination. However, the patient's age and the presence of cognitive impairment (eg, impaired memory, attention, and concentration) make it likely that this is a depressive syndrome secondary to a primary cognitive disorder, such as Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is a medication used in the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. It works by blocking the effects of an excess of glutamate, a neurotransmitter, which can lead to neuronal death when present in high amounts. Fluoxetine is an SSRI used to treat depression, but in this case, the primary issue seems to be cognitive impairment, not depression. Aspirin and ventriculoperitoneal shunt are not relevant treatments for this patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Memantine\"}"
