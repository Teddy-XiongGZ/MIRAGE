    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, confabulation, horizontal nystagmus, bilateral pretibial pitting edema, and perioral erythema are indicative of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a condition often seen in chronic alcoholics due to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine is a cofactor for several key enzymes in the body, including transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The reaction mediated by alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA in the Krebs cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH\"}"
