    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by reducing the production of stomach acid by blocking the enzyme in the wall of the stomach that produces acid. This enzyme is known as the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme, or more commonly, the gastric proton pump. It is a primary active transporter that moves hydrogen ions into the stomach, while moving potassium ions into the cell. Therefore, omeprazole's mechanism of action is the inhibition of this primary active transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Inhibition of primary active transport\"}"
