    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening condition characterized by hyperthermia, altered mental status, autonomic dysregulation, and generalized muscle rigidity (lead pipe rigidity). This condition is often associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, but can also be caused by other drugs such as anti-emetics. The first-line treatment for NMS is discontinuation of the offending agent and supportive care, including hydration and cooling measures. However, when these measures are not sufficient, the next step is the administration of dantrolene, a muscle relaxant that works by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. Acetaminophen is not effective in treating NMS. Intubation may be necessary in severe cases, but it is not the first-line treatment. Supportive therapy alone is not sufficient in this case as the patient's symptoms persist despite initial measures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dantrolene\"}"
