    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body's organs. It's usually linked to asbestos exposure. Asbestos is a group of minerals that were heavily used in industries like shipbuilding, construction, and automotive for their resistance to heat and corrosion before their health effects were well understood. The patient's history of working in a naval shipyard for 10 years during his twenties is a significant risk factor for asbestos exposure. Pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, is a common complication of mesothelioma. It can cause symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath, which the patient is experiencing. Pneumothorax, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and bronchioalveolar carcinoma are not typically associated with mesothelioma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pleural effusion\"}"
