    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive worry, difficulty relaxing, and difficulty concentrating suggest an anxiety disorder. Her shoplifting behavior, which she uses as a coping mechanism for stress, and the subsequent feelings of relief, guilt, and shame suggest kleptomania. Kleptomania is an impulse control disorder characterized by recurrent failure to resist urges to steal items that are not needed for personal use or monetary value. The individual often feels increased tension before the theft and relief or gratification afterward. Treatment of kleptomania often involves cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help the patient recognize and change thought patterns that lead to troublesome behaviors. Lithium is used for bipolar disorder, not kleptomania. Interpersonal therapy is often used for depression and eating disorders. Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on revealing the unconscious content of a client's psyche in an effort to alleviate psychic tension, which is not the primary issue here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
