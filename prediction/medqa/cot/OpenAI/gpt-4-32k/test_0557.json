The sudden onset of a pruritic papular rash and painful inguinal swelling after hiking in the southwestern USA, specifically northern Arizona and New Mexico, provides a clue to the possible cause. Lyme disease is typically associated with a characteristic 'bull's eye' rash and is more common in the northeastern USA. Malaria is typically associated with cyclical fever and is not endemic to the USA. Legionnaire's disease is associated with pneumonia and can cause confusion, but it does not typically cause a rash or lymphadenopathy. The plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, is endemic to the southwestern USA and can cause a sudden onset of fever, chills, weakness, and swollen and painful lymph nodes (buboes), as well as septicemic symptoms such as dyspnea and confusion. The CT scan likely shows pneumonia, which can occur in pneumonic or septicemic plague.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Plague\"}"
