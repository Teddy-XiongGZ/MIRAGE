    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study is comparing survival times between two groups: those diagnosed with GBM via screening MRI before symptoms developed, and those diagnosed after symptom onset. The finding that the asymptomatic group had a longer survival time could be due to the fact that their disease was detected earlier, not necessarily that they lived longer. This is a classic example of lead-time bias, which occurs when early detection of a disease (eg, through screening) is mistaken for increased survival. The 'lead time' is the time between the early detection and the time the disease would have been detected due to symptoms. During this lead time, the disease is known, but it doesn't necessarily change the time of death. Therefore, it appears as if survival is longer when in fact the time of death has not changed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lead-time bias\"}"
