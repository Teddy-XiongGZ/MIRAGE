    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a right adrenal mass, which could potentially be a pheochromocytoma, a tumor that produces excess catecholamines leading to hypertension. During surgery, manipulation of the tumor can cause a sudden release of these catecholamines, leading to a hypertensive crisis. Therefore, it is important to block the effects of these catecholamines preoperatively. Atenolol and labetolol are beta blockers, which should not be used as first-line treatment because unopposed alpha stimulation can worsen hypertension. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, which is not the first-line treatment for this condition. Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective, irreversible alpha blocker, which is the drug of choice to prevent a hypertensive crisis in patients with pheochromocytoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phenoxybenzamine\"}"
