    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of persistent, projectile vomiting in a 1-month-old infant, along with the physical finding of an 'olive-shaped' mass in the epigastric region, are classic for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Therefore, the acid-base disturbance associated with this condition is metabolic alkalosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metabolic alkalosis\"}"
