    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a myocardial infarction, specifically in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. The blood supply to this area is typically provided by the posterior descending artery (PDA), which is a branch of either the right coronary artery (RCA) or the left circumflex artery (LCX), depending on the dominance of the coronary circulation. In about 70-80% of individuals, the RCA gives rise to the PDA, making it the most likely artery to be occluded in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Right main\"}"
