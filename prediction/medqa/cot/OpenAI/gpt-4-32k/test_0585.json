    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain that increases with inspiration, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds are indicative of a cardiac issue. The ECG findings of sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude further support this. Kawasaki disease and rheumatic fever are typically seen in children, not adults. Infective endocarditis usually presents with fever, heart murmur, and signs of systemic infection, which are not prominent in this case. Cardiac tamponade, however, is characterized by the symptoms and ECG findings seen in this patient, making it the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Cardiac tamponade\"}"
