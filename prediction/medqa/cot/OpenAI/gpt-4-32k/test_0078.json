    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn's symptoms of cyanosis immediately after birth, progressive respiratory failure, a single loud S2 heart sound, a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border, and an enlarged 'egg-shaped' heart on radiography are all indicative of a congenital heart defect. The fact that an atrial septostomy was performed to alleviate the condition suggests that the defect involves a mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, which is characteristic of transposition of the great vessels. Coarctation of the aorta, persistent truncus arteriosus, and tricuspid atresia do not typically present with these specific symptoms and would not be alleviated by an atrial septostomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Transposition of great vessels\"}"
