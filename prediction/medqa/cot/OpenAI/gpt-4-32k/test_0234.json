    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of a progressively growing mass in his axilla, recurrent episodes of low-grade fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, along with the biopsy findings of granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei, are indicative of a lymphoma, likely Hodgkin's lymphoma. The elevated serum calcium concentration and low PTH concentration suggest hypercalcemia of malignancy, which is most commonly caused by the production of PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) by malignant cells. PTHrP mimics the action of PTH and leads to increased bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption, resulting in hypercalcemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells\"}"
