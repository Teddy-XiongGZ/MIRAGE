    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The prognosis of breast cancer is determined by several factors. However, among the options given, the tumor stage is the most important. The stage of the tumor includes the size of the tumor, whether it has spread to lymph nodes, and whether it has spread to distant sites. The tumor grade, which refers to how abnormal the cells look under a microscope, is also important but not as much as the stage. The age of the patient and the location of the tumor on the breast are less significant factors in determining the prognosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Tumor stage\"}"
