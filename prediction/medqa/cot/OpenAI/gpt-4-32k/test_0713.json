    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. The condition develops when the body can't produce enough insulin. The fruity smell of the breath is due to the presence of ketones. The patient's blood glucose level is extremely high, and urinalysis is positive for ketone bodies, further supporting the diagnosis of DKA. The immediate management of DKA involves fluid replacement to correct dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and acidosis, and insulin therapy to suppress the production of ketone bodies and correct hyperglycemia. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient is to administer IV fluids and insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Administer IV fluids and insulin\"}"
