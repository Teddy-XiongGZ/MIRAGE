    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rigidity observed in the body is due to a process called rigor mortis, which occurs after death. This process is not related to the snake's neurotoxins, the effect of low temperature on muscle proteins, or the depletion of intracellular calcium. Instead, it is due to the cessation of ATP production after death, which leads to the inability to break the cross-bridges between actin and myosin in the muscle fibers, causing the muscles to become rigid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling\"}"
