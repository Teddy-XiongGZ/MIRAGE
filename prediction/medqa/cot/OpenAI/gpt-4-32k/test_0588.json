This is a common condition in women who have had multiple vaginal deliveries. The first line of treatment for symptomatic uterine prolapse is usually conservative, with the use of a pessary. There are two types of pessaries: support and space-filling.

Therefore, a support pessary would be the most reasonable treatment to offer this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Support pessary\"}"
