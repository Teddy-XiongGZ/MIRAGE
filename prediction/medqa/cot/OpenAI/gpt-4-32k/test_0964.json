    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of vertigo, vomiting, hearing loss, and a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane suggest acute otitis media (AOM), which is an infection of the middle ear. The most common pathogens causing AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The first-line treatment for AOM in adults is amoxicillin, as it covers all the common pathogens and is generally well-tolerated. Cefepime, cefotaxime, and cephalexin are all cephalosporins, which could be used if the patient had an allergy to penicillins, but there is no indication of that in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
