    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of smoking, chronic productive cough, and the physical and radiographic findings of wheezing, increased lung lucency, and diaphragmatic flattening are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The initial management of COPD involves short-acting bronchodilators such as albuterol. Corticosteroids like prednisone are used in acute exacerbations of COPD, but there is no mention of an acute exacerbation in this case. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used primarily in asthma, and theophylline is a bronchodilator that is rarely used due to its side effects and narrow therapeutic index. Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic used in COPD, but it is not the first-line treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Albuterol and montelukast\"}"
