    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of calf pain when walking a certain distance that subsides with rest is indicative of claudication, a symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). This is likely due to his history of smoking and diabetes. The first-line treatment for PAD is risk factor modification and exercise therapy. However, if these measures are insufficient, medication can be used. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that has been shown to improve symptoms and increase walking distance in patients with claudication. Surgical interventions such as femoral embolectomy, femoral-to-popliteal bypass graft, and interventional endovascular treatment are usually reserved for severe cases where there is critical limb ischemia or complications such as aneurysms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cilostazol\"}"
