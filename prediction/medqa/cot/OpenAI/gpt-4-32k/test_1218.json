    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node. This is also known as Virchow's node, and it is often associated with malignancy, particularly of the abdomen or thorax. Given the patient's history of smoking, a lung cancer could be a possibility. Therefore, a chest radiograph would be a logical next step to look for any lung abnormalities. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy could be considered if there were symptoms suggestive of a gastrointestinal malignancy, but this patient does not have such symptoms. An MRI of the brain would not be the first choice unless there were neurological symptoms. An ultrasound of the neck could be useful to evaluate the lymph node itself, but it would not help identify the primary malignancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Chest radiograph\"}"
