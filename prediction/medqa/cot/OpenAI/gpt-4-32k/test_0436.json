    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of frontal bossing, shortened extremities, and normal axial skeleton, along with the genetic analysis revealing an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor, suggest a diagnosis of achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that prevents the changing of cartilage (particularly in the long bones) to bone. It is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which negatively impacts chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in the growth plate. The process that is disrupted in achondroplasia is endochondral ossification, which is the process by which long bones grow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Endochondral ossification\"}"
