    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a problem with the left eye, specifically with the optic nerve or the afferent pathway of the pupillary light reflex. When light is shone into a healthy eye, both pupils should constrict (miosis) due to the pupillary light reflex. This is a direct response in the illuminated eye and a consensual response in the other eye. If the left eye is not responding to light, it indicates a problem with the afferent pathway in the left eye. However, the efferent pathway, which causes the pupils to constrict, is likely still intact. Therefore, when light is shone into the right eye, both pupils should constrict. This is because the right eye's afferent pathway and both eyes' efferent pathways are functioning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Bilateral miosis\"}"
