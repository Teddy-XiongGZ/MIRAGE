    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study design described here involves identifying a group of individuals with a specific condition (interstitial lung disease) and a matched group without the condition. The researchers then look back in time to assess exposure to a potential risk factor (the fire retardant chemical). This is characteristic of a case-control study, where 'cases' are individuals with the disease and 'controls' are those without. Case series involve only individuals with the disease and do not include a comparison group. Retrospective cohort studies involve identifying two groups based on exposure status and then looking back in time to see who developed the disease. Randomized controlled trials involve random assignment to a treatment or control group, which is not described here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Case-control study\"}"
