    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's analyze each option. A. Capitation is a payment model where physicians are paid a set amount for each patient they see, regardless of the number or type of services provided. This can actually pose a significant financial risk to physicians if the cost of providing care exceeds the capitation payment. So, this statement is false. B. Fee-for-service is a payment model where physicians are paid for each service they provide, not a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care. So, this statement is also false. C. Fee-for-service may indeed incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality, as they are paid for each service they provide. This statement is true. D. Fee-for-service does not necessarily pose the most amount of financial risk to physicians. The risk depends on various factors, including the cost of providing care and the reimbursement rates for services. So, this statement is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
