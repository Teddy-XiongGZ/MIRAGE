This is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by an excessive and irrational fear of a specific situation, object, or activity that is avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The first-line treatment for specific phobias is exposure therapy, a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This therapy involves gradually and repeatedly exposing the patient to the feared object or situation until the patient becomes desensitized. Medications like Alprazolam and Fluoxetine can be used as adjunctive treatment, but they are not the first-line treatment. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is not typically used for specific phobias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cognitive behavioral therapy\"}"
