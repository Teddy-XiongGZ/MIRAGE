    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of Hirschsprung disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to functional obstruction and inability to pass meconium. This condition is more common in males and in patients with Down syndrome. However, it can also occur in patients without these risk factors. The first step in the evaluation of a neonate with suspected Hirschsprung disease is an abdominal radiograph to assess for bowel obstruction. If the radiograph is suggestive of Hirschsprung disease (eg, dilated bowel loops with a transition zone), the diagnosis is confirmed with rectal suction biopsy, which shows absence of ganglion cells. A contrast enema can also suggest the diagnosis but is less commonly used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Abdominal radiograph\"}"
