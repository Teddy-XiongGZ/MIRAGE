    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate sleep at night, and a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes (normal is 10-20 minutes) on a sleep study, suggest a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to control sleep-wake cycles. It is typically treated with medications that promote wakefulness or suppress REM sleep. Methylphenidate is a stimulant used to treat narcolepsy by promoting wakefulness. Sodium oxybate is used to treat cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, but the patient does not have symptoms of cataplexy. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to suppress REM sleep in narcolepsy, but it is not the first-line treatment. Increasing daytime naps can help manage symptoms but is not a definitive treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Methylphenidate\"}"
