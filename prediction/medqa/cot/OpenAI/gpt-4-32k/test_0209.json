    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of smoking, age, and the presence of a painless ulcer on the lip that has persisted for 3 months are all suggestive of a malignancy. Aphthous stomatitis usually presents as painful ulcers and is therefore less likely. Actinic keratosis is a precancerous condition caused by sun exposure, but it usually presents as rough, scaly patches on the skin, not as an ulcer. A traumatic ulcer would likely be painful and would not persist for 3 months without an ongoing trauma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma, which is the most common oral cancer and is strongly associated with tobacco use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
