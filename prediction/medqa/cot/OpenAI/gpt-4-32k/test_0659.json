'Popcorn' pattern is usually associated with hamartomas, which are benign lung tumors, so they don't typically require removal. Extending fine striations are often associated with inflammatory processes, not necessarily malignancy. A doubling time of < 1 month is too rapid for most malignancies, which usually double in size over a period of 1-6 months. A subsolid component in a nodule is concerning for malignancy, and thus would most likely prompt removal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
