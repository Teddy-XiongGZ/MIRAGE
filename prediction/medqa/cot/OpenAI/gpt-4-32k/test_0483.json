    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of altered mental status, history of cirrhosis, and physical exam findings of a distended abdomen and asterixis are suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is caused by the accumulation of ammonia in the blood, which is normally metabolized by the liver. The best initial treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is lactulose, which helps to reduce blood ammonia levels. Dextrose would be used for hypoglycemia, but the patient's glucose level is low-normal. Potassium would be used for hypokalemia, but the patient's potassium level is also low-normal. Rifaximin is used as a secondary treatment for hepatic encephalopathy when lactulose is not sufficient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lactulose\"}"
