    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision, especially prominent on left-side lateral gaze, suggest a neurological issue. The lack of fever, headache, ocular pain, lacrimation, changes in color vision, or limb weakness rules out conditions like optic neuritis, glaucoma, or other ocular diseases. The patient's past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke, along with his smoking habit, puts him at a high risk for vascular diseases, including stroke. The normal mental status examination and muscle strength in all 4 limbs suggest that the issue is localized and not widespread. The decreased sensations on his left side, including his face, suggest a lesion in the central nervous system. The abnormal extraocular movements, especially on lateral gaze, suggest a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which is responsible for coordinating eye movements, particularly horizontal gaze.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Medial longitudinal fasciculus\"}"
