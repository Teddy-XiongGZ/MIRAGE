    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of ascending cholangitis, which is a serious infection of the biliary tract that typically occurs secondary to obstruction, most commonly from gallstones. The patient's ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder support this diagnosis. Ascending cholangitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt biliary decompression to prevent severe complications such as sepsis and hepatic abscess. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the procedure of choice for both diagnosing and treating ascending cholangitis because it allows for direct visualization of the biliary tree, removal of stones, and placement of a stent if necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
