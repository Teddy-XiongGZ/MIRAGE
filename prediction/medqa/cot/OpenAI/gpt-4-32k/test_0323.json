    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of rickets, a condition characterized by impaired growth plate mineralization. The patient's exclusive breastfeeding, delayed walking, dental caries, frontal bossing, widened wrists, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs are all consistent with this diagnosis. Rickets is typically caused by vitamin D deficiency, which leads to impaired mineralization of the growth plate. Deficiency of cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase is associated with scurvy, not rickets. A defect in type I collagen is associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, which presents with bone fragility and blue sclera, not the features seen in this patient. A mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 is associated with achondroplasia, which presents with short stature and rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, not the features seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Impaired growth plate mineralization\"}"
