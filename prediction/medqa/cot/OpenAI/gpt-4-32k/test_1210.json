    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of yellowing of the eyes, or scleral icterus, indicate jaundice, which is caused by an excess of bilirubin. The patient's history of a similar episode during a period of stress (recovery from an appendectomy) and recent fasting and binge drinking, which are also stressors, suggest a condition that is exacerbated by stress. This points towards Gilbert's syndrome, a common, benign genetic disorder characterized by intermittent episodes of jaundice due to decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of bilirubin. The other options are less likely: autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of the biliary tract and chronic viral infection of the liver would likely present with additional symptoms and signs, and defective bilirubin excretion would not be intermittent or triggered by stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase\"}"
