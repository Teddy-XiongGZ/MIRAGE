The elevated amylase level further supports this diagnosis. Acute pancreatitis can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which can cause capillary leakage. This can result in hypotension and tachycardia, as seen in this patient. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well. Abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis would likely present with bleeding or clotting symptoms, which are not mentioned. Decreased cardiac output would typically present with symptoms of heart failure, which are also not mentioned. Pseudocyst formation is a complication of pancreatitis, but it would not explain the patient's vital sign abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Capillary leakage\"}"
