    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of dizziness and palpitations, combined with the recent history of heavy alcohol consumption, suggest a cardiac issue. However, without the ECG results, it's hard to definitively diagnose. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could be a possibility, as it can be triggered by alcohol and cause these symptoms. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause dangerous heart rhythms, but it's less likely in a previously healthy individual. Ventricular tachycardia could also cause these symptoms, but it's usually seen in people with heart disease. Sick sinus syndrome is a group of heart rhythm problems due to malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker, and it's more common in older adults. Therefore, based on the information given, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation seems the most likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
