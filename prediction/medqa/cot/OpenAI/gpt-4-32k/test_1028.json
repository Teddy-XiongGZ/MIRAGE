    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor of fat cells. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells, which is a common feature of all cancers. This uncontrolled growth is often due to the cells' ability to bypass the normal cellular mechanisms that prevent excessive growth and division. One of these mechanisms is the shortening of telomeres, which are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. Each time a cell divides, its telomeres shorten, and when they become too short, the cell can no longer divide and becomes senescent or dies. However, some cancer cells can activate an enzyme called telomerase, which rebuilds the telomeres, allowing the cells to continue dividing indefinitely. Therefore, in a liposarcoma, we would expect to see increased activity of telomerase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Telomerase\"}"
