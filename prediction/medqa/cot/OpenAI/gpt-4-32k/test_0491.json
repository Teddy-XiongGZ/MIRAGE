    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics clearly states that physicians should not engage in romantic or sexual relationships with their patients. This is because such relationships can exploit the trust, knowledge, emotions, and influence derived from the professional relationship. Even if the patient's case is uncomplicated, it is still inappropriate for the physician to date the patient. Also, it is not appropriate to date a patient even after the physician-patient relationship has been terminated, as the power dynamics may still exist. Therefore, the physician should inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
