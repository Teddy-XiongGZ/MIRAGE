    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of intense itching around the anus and a positive scotch tape test suggest a pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) infection. This is a common parasitic infection that is usually treated with albendazole. However, the patient has a documented allergy to albendazole. Therefore, an alternative medication needs to be used. Amphotericin B is used for systemic fungal infections, not parasitic infections. Praziquantel is used for tapeworm and schistosomiasis, not pinworms. Ivermectin is used for strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, not pinworms. Pyrantel pamoate is an alternative medication for pinworms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Pyrantel pamoate\"}"
