    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), which is defined as rupture of membranes prior to 37 weeks' gestation. The diagnosis is confirmed by pooling of amniotic fluid in the vagina, positive nitrazine test, and/or ferning. Management of PPROM includes hospitalization, monitoring for labor and infection, and administration of corticosteroids if the gestational age is between 24 and 34 weeks to accelerate fetal lung maturity and decrease the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Antibiotics (eg, ampicillin) are also given to prolong latency period and reduce maternal and neonatal infection. Delivery is not indicated unless there is labor, chorioamnionitis, or fetal compromise. Therefore, the next step in management should be administration of betamethasone and ampicillin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor\"}"
