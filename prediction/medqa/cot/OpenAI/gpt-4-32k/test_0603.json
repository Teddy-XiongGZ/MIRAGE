Dermatofibromas are common, benign, fibrous skin tumors that often occur on the extremities. They are usually asymptomatic, but can be tender or pruritic. They are often mistaken for insect bites. The characteristic finding on physical examination is the 'dimple sign,' which is observed when the lesion is squeezed and the surface retracts inward. This is not characteristic of cherry hemangioma, actinic keratosis, or seborrheic keratosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Dermatofibroma\"}"
