    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of diffuse bodily aches, particularly in the shoulders and hips, along with a history of fractures from a minor fall, suggest a systemic bone disease. The elevated calcium level in her blood work is also indicative of a bone-related disorder. The most common cause of hypercalcemia in an outpatient setting is primary hyperparathyroidism, but this patient's presentation is more suggestive of malignancy-related hypercalcemia, given her age, diffuse bone pain, and history of fractures. The most common malignancy to present in this manner is multiple myeloma, which often presents with bone pain and hypercalcemia. Radiographic findings in multiple myeloma typically include well-defined lytic lesions, but this option is not given. The next best choice would be a well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis, which can also be seen in multiple myeloma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
