    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, ataxia, and visual hallucinations are suggestive of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). This is a prion disease, which is caused by misfolded proteins that induce normal proteins to also misfold. The history of a corneal transplant is significant, as CJD can be transmitted through contaminated surgical instruments and transplanted tissue, even after autoclaving. Prions do not contain genetic material and can survive independent from a host. They also do not have a cell wall, and they do not lead to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
