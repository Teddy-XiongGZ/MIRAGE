    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, difficulty feeding, and inability to sit upright, along with the physical findings of a protruding tongue, distended neck veins, crackles at both lung bases, an S3 gallop, and a palpable liver, suggest a condition affecting the heart and muscles. The chest x-ray showing cardiomegaly confirms a cardiac involvement. The profound weakness in both proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities indicates a myopathy. This combination of cardiomyopathy and myopathy in an infant is suggestive of a glycogen storage disease, specifically Pompe disease (type II glycogen storage disease). Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme lysosomal acid maltase, which is responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose. When this enzyme is deficient, glycogen accumulates in the lysosomes of cells, particularly in the heart and skeletal muscles, leading to the symptoms seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Lysosomal acid maltase\"}"
