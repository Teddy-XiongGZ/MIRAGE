    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been bitten by a stray dog and has developed localized cellulitis, which is an infection of the skin and soft tissue. The bacteria that commonly cause such infections after a dog bite include Pasteurella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and anaerobes. Amoxicillin alone is not sufficient to cover all these organisms. Clindamycin is generally used for serious skin and soft tissue infections, but it does not cover Pasteurella species. Doxycycline is not the first-line treatment for dog bites. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, however, covers a broad range of organisms including those mentioned and is the recommended first-line treatment for dog bites.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Amoxicillin-clavulanate\"}"
