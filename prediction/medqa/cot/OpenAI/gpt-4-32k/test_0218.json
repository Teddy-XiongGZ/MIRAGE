    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Type I hypersensitivity reactions, also known as immediate hypersensitivity reactions, are mediated by IgE antibodies. These antibodies bind to mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. The histamine causes increased vascular permeability, leading to fluid leakage into the tissues and the formation of wheals. The skin layer where these changes would be most evident is the dermis, which contains the blood vessels and mast cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Dermis\"}"
