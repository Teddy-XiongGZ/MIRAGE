    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why there is a difference in the relationship between DLBCL risk and cART adherence in patients with different CD4+ cell counts. The key here is that the relationship changes depending on the level of CD4+ cell count, which is a characteristic of effect modification. Effect modification, also known as interaction, occurs when the effect of a main exposure on an outcome is modified by the level of another variable. In this case, the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by the level of CD4+ cell count. This is not a case of poor generalizability, as the study is not trying to apply its findings to a larger population. Stratified sampling is a method of sampling, not a reason for observed differences. Random error could lead to differences, but the significant p-value in the first group suggests that the observed effect is not due to chance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Effect modification\"}"
