    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Th1 cells are a type of T helper cells that play a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity. They secrete various cytokines to stimulate immune responses. IL-4 is typically associated with Th2 cells and is involved in humoral immunity, so it's not the correct answer. TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, but it's not the primary factor responsible for the actions described in the question. Histamine is involved in allergic reactions and inflammation, but it's not secreted by Th1 cells. IFN-gamma, on the other hand, is a key cytokine secreted by Th1 cells. It's known to stimulate phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages, activate macrophages to produce mediators like NO, and lead to the formation of a tubercle during a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. IFN-gamma\"}"
