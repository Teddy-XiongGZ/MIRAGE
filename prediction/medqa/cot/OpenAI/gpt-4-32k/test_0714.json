    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden, severe chest pain described as ripping and radiating to the back, along with physical findings of being tall and having joint hypermobility, suggest a diagnosis of aortic dissection. This condition is often associated with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome, which would explain the patient's physical characteristics. Aortic dissection can lead to aortic regurgitation, which would present as a diastolic murmur. However, none of the options provided describe a diastolic murmur. Among the options, a systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space is typically associated with aortic stenosis, which could be a complication of aortic dissection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
