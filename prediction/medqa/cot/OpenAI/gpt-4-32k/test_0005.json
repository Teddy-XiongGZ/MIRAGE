    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of chest pain, nausea, and diaphoresis, along with his history of untreated hypertension, smoking, and recent cocaine use, are highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The first step in managing ACS is to stabilize the patient and relieve the chest pain. Among the options provided, none of them are the ideal first-line treatment for ACS, which would be aspirin and nitroglycerin. However, among the choices, labetalol could be used as it is a non-selective beta blocker and alpha-1 receptor blocker, which can help reduce blood pressure and heart rate, potentially relieving some of the strain on the heart. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, could also be used for this purpose, but it is not typically the first choice in this situation. Propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, could also be used, but it does not have the additional alpha-blocking effects of labetalol. Reassurance and continuous monitoring alone would not be sufficient in this case, as the patient is in marked distress and likely needs immediate medical intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Labetalol\"}"
