    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic nerve terminals is a process that involves several steps. First, an action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal, causing depolarization. This depolarization leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, which allows calcium ions to flow into the cell. The influx of calcium then triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, leading to the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Therefore, the event that most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters is the influx of calcium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Influx of calcium\"}"
