    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress, facial edema, and skin rash after eating, along with her history of severe peanut allergy, suggest anaphylaxis, a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with intramuscular (IM) epinephrine, which can rapidly reverse the symptoms. Oral diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, is not appropriate as first-line treatment for anaphylaxis because it does not act quickly enough. Topical diphenhydramine is used for skin itching and hives, but it would not address the systemic symptoms of anaphylaxis. Inhaled sodium cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer used for asthma and allergic rhinitis, but it is not used for acute anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. IM epinephrine\"}"
