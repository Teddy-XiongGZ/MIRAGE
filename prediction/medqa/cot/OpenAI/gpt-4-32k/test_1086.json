    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of systemic hypotension, bradycardia, hypoventilation, altered level of consciousness, decreased movements, hypotonia, bulging anterior fontanelle, and cyanosis in a premature neonate is highly suggestive of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). IVH is a common complication in premature infants, especially those with low birth weight. The best initial diagnostic test for IVH is cranial ultrasonography because it is safe, readily available, and does not require the infant to be transported out of the neonatal intensive care unit, which could potentially worsen the infant's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cranial ultrasonography\"}"
