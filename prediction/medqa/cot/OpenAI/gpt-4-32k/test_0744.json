    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions), and sleep paralysis are suggestive of narcolepsy. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 17 also indicates severe excessive daytime sleepiness. The first-line treatment for narcolepsy is a wakefulness-promoting agent, such as modafinil. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant used to treat cataplexy, but it's not the first-line treatment.

Sleep deprivation would likely worsen the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Modafinil\"}"
