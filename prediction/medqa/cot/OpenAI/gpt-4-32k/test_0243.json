    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was started on rosuvastatin, a statin, and developed muscle pain and weakness, which are known side effects of statins. These symptoms resolved after stopping the medication, suggesting that they were indeed caused by the statin. The patient still needs treatment for his high LDL levels. Restarting rosuvastatin at a lower dose might still cause the same side effects. Fenofibrate is used for high triglyceride levels, not specifically for LDL. Fish oils can help lower triglyceride levels but are not the first-line treatment for high LDL levels. Therefore, the best option would be to try a different statin, which might be better tolerated by the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Initiate a different statin\"}"
