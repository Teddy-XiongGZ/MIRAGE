    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of itchy blisters that do not rupture easily, along with the immunofluorescence findings of linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane, are indicative of an autoimmune blistering disorder. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a bacterial infection, which does not fit with the immunofluorescence findings. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by flaccid bullae and positive Nikolsky's sign, which is not the case here. Cicatricial pemphigoid typically affects mucous membranes, which is not mentioned in the scenario. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is bullous pemphigoid, which is characterized by tense bullae that do not rupture easily and linear immunofluorescence along the basement membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Bullous pemphigoid\"}"
