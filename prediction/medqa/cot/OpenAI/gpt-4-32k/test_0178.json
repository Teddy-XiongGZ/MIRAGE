    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a Brown-Sequard syndrome, which is a hemicord lesion of the spinal cord. This syndrome is characterized by ipsilateral (same side) motor loss and proprioception loss, and contralateral (opposite side) loss of pain and temperature sensation. The motor loss is due to the damage to the corticospinal tract, which carries motor signals from the brain to the body and is located on the same side of the lesion. The loss of pain and temperature sensation is due to damage to the spinothalamic tract, which carries these sensations from the body to the brain and crosses to the opposite side of the spinal cord shortly after entering it. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be right-sided analgesia, which is loss of pain sensation on the side opposite to the lesion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Right-sided analgesia\"}"
