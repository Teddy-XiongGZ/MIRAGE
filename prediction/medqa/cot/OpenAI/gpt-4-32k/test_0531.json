    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. The initial management of DKA includes fluid resuscitation, which has already been started with 0.9% NaCl. The next step is to start insulin therapy to decrease blood glucose levels and suppress ketogenesis. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is not typically recommended for DKA unless the pH is less than 6.9. Switching fluids to 0.45% NaCl is not the immediate next step, and potassium replacement is usually done after starting insulin and checking serum potassium levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Start IV insulin infusion\"}"
