    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's labs show a low bicarbonate level and a low pH, indicating a metabolic acidosis. The low pCO2 indicates that the patient is compensating for the acidosis by hyperventilating to blow off CO2 and raise the pH. The most common causes of metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap are diarrhea, renal tubular acidosis, and certain medications. The patient's history of diarrhea and the absence of other symptoms or risk factors for the other conditions make diarrhea the most likely cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Diarrhea\"}"
