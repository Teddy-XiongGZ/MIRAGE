    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of trauma, followed by a lucid interval and then sudden deterioration, is characteristic of an epidural hematoma. This is typically caused by a tear in the middle meningeal artery, which is often associated with a temporal bone fracture. The CT scan would typically show a lens-shaped hematoma. The patient's fixed and dilated left pupil suggests herniation, which is a life-threatening condition that can occur as a result of the increased intracranial pressure from the hematoma. Dural arteriovenous fistula, Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm, and arteriovenous malformation are not typically associated with trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Tearing of the middle meningeal artery\"}"
