    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that males (XY) who inherit the affected gene on their X chromosome from their mother will have the disease. Females (XX), on the other hand, must inherit two affected genes (one from each parent) to have the disease. However, if they inherit only one affected gene, they become carriers. In this case, the father has hemophilia A, so he contributes an affected X chromosome to his daughters. The mother, who is unaffected, contributes a normal X chromosome. Therefore, all daughters will be carriers of the disease because they inherit the affected X chromosome from their father and a normal X chromosome from their mother.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 100%\"}"
