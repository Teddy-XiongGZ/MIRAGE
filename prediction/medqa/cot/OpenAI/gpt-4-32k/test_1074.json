    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection are suggestive of opioid withdrawal. This is a common condition that can occur in individuals who have been taking opioids for a long period of time and then suddenly stop. The treatment for opioid withdrawal is to replace the opioid the patient was taking with a longer-acting opioid that can be slowly tapered down. Methadone is a long-acting opioid that is commonly used for this purpose. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and seizures, but it won't treat the underlying opioid withdrawal. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used to prevent relapse after detoxification, but it can precipitate withdrawal if given too soon. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose, but it's not used for treating withdrawal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Methadone\"}"
