    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a small, calcified nodule in the right middle lobe of his lung that has grown slightly over the course of a year. The growth is slow and the nodule is calcified, which are characteristics of a benign lesion. However, the growth of the nodule is concerning and warrants further investigation. A CT scan in 24 months (option A) would be too long to wait given the growth of the nodule. A PET scan (option B) could be useful in determining if the nodule is metabolically active, but it is not the first step in evaluation. A lobectomy (option C) is too invasive at this stage. A bronchoscopy-guided biopsy (option D) would provide a tissue diagnosis and is the most appropriate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
