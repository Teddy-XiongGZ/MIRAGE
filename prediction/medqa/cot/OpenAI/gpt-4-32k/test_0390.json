    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 58-year-old African American man with a family history of prostate cancer in his father. However, the USPSTF does not recommend routine PSA screening for prostate cancer due to the potential harms outweighing the benefits. A digital rectal exam is also not recommended as a routine screening test. An abdominal ultrasound is not indicated in this patient as he does not have any symptoms or risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is a screening test for colorectal cancer, which is recommended every 10 years for adults aged 50-75.

Therefore, none of the options provided are appropriate for this patient at this time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
