These symptoms suggest a bacterial infection, possibly a COPD exacerbation caused by a bacterial pathogen. Antibiotics are often used in such cases to treat the underlying infection. Doxycycline, Ciprofloxacin, and Erythromycin are all antibiotics, but the choice of antibiotic should be based on the most common pathogens causing COPD exacerbations, which are Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
