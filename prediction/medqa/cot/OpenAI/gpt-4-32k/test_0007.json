    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with acute chest pain, ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF on ECG, and increased serum troponin T concentration, which are indicative of acute coronary syndrome. He was treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries. After such a procedure, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended to prevent stent thrombosis. DAPT consists of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, such as clopidogrel. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker and is not typically used in this context. Enoxaparin is an anticoagulant, but DAPT is the standard of care after angioplasty. Spironolactone is a diuretic and is not indicated in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Clopidogrel\"}"
