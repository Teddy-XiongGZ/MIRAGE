    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a simple way of classifying the extent of heart failure. It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity. The limitations/symptoms are in regard to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and/or angina pain. Class I is no limitation of physical activity. Class II is slight limitation of physical activity. Class III is marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV is unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. The patient's symptoms have worsened to the point where even simple tasks are burdensome, but she is still able to perform them, albeit with difficulty. This indicates a marked limitation of physical activity, which corresponds to NYHA Class III.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. New York Heart Association Class III\"}"
