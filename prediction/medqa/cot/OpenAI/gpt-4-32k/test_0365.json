Dehydration can stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to help maintain blood pressure and fluid balance. Renin is a hormone secreted by the kidneys when there is a decrease in blood volume or blood pressure. It is part of the RAAS and its main function is to increase blood pressure. Therefore, in this case, the patient's renin secretion would likely be increased to compensate for the fluid loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Renin\"}"
