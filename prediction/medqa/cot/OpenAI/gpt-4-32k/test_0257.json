    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's initial presentation of hyperphenylalaninemia and response to dietary modification is consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase or its cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). This enzyme is necessary for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. Without it, phenylalanine accumulates and can cause intellectual disability, seizures, and a musty body odor. The patient's blue eyes, pale skin, and blonde hair are due to decreased melanin synthesis, as tyrosine is a precursor for melanin. The hypotonia and elevated prolactin level suggest that this patient has a BH4 deficiency rather than phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, as BH4 is also a necessary cofactor for the synthesis of dopamine. Without dopamine, prolactin levels rise. Therefore, supplementation with BH4 is necessary to prevent further complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tetrahydrobiopterin\"}"
