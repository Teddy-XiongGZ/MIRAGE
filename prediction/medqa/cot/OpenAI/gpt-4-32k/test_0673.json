Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia, which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, and jaundice. It can also cause neurological symptoms due to its role in myelin synthesis. The oropharyngeal symptoms in this case are likely due to the effects of vitamin B12 deficiency on the oral mucosa.
