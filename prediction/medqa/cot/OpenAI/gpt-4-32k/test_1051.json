    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the steady state concentration of the drug. The formula for this is Css = (F * Dose) / (Cl * Tau), where F is the bioavailability, Cl is the clearance, and Tau is the dosing interval. However, we don't have the clearance. We can calculate it using the formula Cl = 0.693 * Vd / t1/2, where Vd is the volume of distribution and t1/2 is the half-life. After calculating the clearance, we can substitute it into the first formula to find the dose. However, we need to remember that the dose we calculate will be for every 2 hours (because of the half-life), so we need to multiply it by 4 to get the dose for every 8 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 430 milligrams\"}"
