    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a statistical method to compare the changes in measurements between different groups. Pearson correlation analysis is used to measure the strength and direction of association between two continuous variables, which is not the case here. Chi-square test is used to test the association between two categorical variables, which is also not the case here. Kaplan-Meier analysis is used for survival analysis, which is not relevant in this context. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to compare the means of more than two groups, which is exactly what we need here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Analysis of variance\"}"
