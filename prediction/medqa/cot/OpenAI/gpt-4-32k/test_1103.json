    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and ankle swelling, along with the physical findings of bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema, widely split S2 that varies with respiration, and right bundle branch block on ECG, are suggestive of heart failure. In heart failure, the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to a buildup of fluid in the body, including the lower extremities. This results in increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, which forces fluid out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, causing edema. Localized lymphatic obstruction and thrombus formation in a deep vein would typically cause unilateral, not bilateral, edema. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure, such as in hypoalbuminemia, can also cause edema, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history or examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure\"}"
