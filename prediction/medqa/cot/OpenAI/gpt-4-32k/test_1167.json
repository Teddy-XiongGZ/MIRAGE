    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and a harsh pansystolic murmur heard over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd\u20133rd intercostal space that becomes louder with squatting are indicative of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSDs are defects in the interventricular septum that allow blood to shunt from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. The interventricular septum is formed by the endocardial cushion and the muscular part of the heart, which is derived from the primary heart field. The infundibular septum is involved in the formation of the outflow tracts and is not related to VSD. The 3rd pharyngeal arch gives rise to structures in the neck, not the heart. Rathke\u2019s pouch gives rise to the anterior pituitary, not the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Endocardial cushion\"}"
