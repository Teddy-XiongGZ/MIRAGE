    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's ECG findings are consistent with ventricular fibrillation, a life-threatening arrhythmia that results in ineffective quivering of the ventricles instead of a coordinated contraction. This leads to a severe decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure, causing the patient to become pulseless. The initial management of ventricular fibrillation involves immediate defibrillation. If defibrillation is unsuccessful, as in this case, the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithm recommends administration of epinephrine every 3-5 minutes and consideration of an antiarrhythmic drug. The two most commonly used antiarrhythmics in this setting are amiodarone and lidocaine. Therefore, since the patient has already received epinephrine and defibrillation attempts have failed, the next step would be to administer an antiarrhythmic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Amiodarone\"}"
