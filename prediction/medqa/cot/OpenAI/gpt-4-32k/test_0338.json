This is a common condition that can occur in individuals who have stopped or reduced the use of opioids after heavy and prolonged use. Clonidine is a medication that can help reduce some of the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, such as anxiety, agitation, muscle aches, sweating, runny nose, and cramping.

Oseltamivir is an antiviral medication used to treat influenza, which also does not match the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Clonidine\"}"
