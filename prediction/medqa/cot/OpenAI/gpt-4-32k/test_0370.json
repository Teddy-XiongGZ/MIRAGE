    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is suffering from an asthma attack, which is characterized by bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Nebulized bronchodilators, such as albuterol, are often used in this situation. Albuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. When these receptors are activated, they stimulate adenylate cyclase to convert ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels lead to bronchodilation, which helps to relieve the symptoms of an asthma attack.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased adenylate cyclase activity\"}"
