    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's gunshot wound is located in the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line, which is a high-risk area for injury to vital structures such as the heart and lungs. His blood pressure is low, indicating possible internal bleeding. The chest x-ray shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe, which could be due to a hemothorax or a lung contusion. The focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium, which rules out cardiac tamponade. However, the assessment of the abdomen is equivocal, which means it's unclear whether there is any injury to the abdominal organs. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to further evaluate the extent of the injuries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
