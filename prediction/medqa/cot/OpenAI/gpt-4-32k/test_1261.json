    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is characterized by an increase in myeloblasts in the bone marrow. Auer rods are a characteristic finding in AML. The best treatment option for a subtype of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which induces differentiation of the immature leukemic promyelocytes into mature granulocytes. Ascorbic acid is not a treatment for AML. Fresh frozen plasma is used to correct coagulation factor deficiencies, but it does not treat the underlying cause of AML. Zoledronic acid is used in the treatment of hypercalcemia and bone metastases, not AML.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Retinoic acid\"}"
