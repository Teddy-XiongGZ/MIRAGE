    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a condition that commonly affects overweight adolescents. It is characterized by displacement of the femoral head from the femoral neck. The patient's pain, limp, and externally rotated leg are typical signs of SCFE. The most appropriate treatment for SCFE is surgical pinning of the affected hip to prevent further slippage and potential complications. Reassessing in 3 months (choice A) would not be appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the risk of further slippage. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection (choice B) is not a treatment for SCFE. A Pavlik harness (choice C) is used for developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants, not for SCFE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Surgical pinning of the right hip\"}"
