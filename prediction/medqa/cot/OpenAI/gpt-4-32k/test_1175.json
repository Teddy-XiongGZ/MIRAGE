    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of morning stiffness, wrist and neck pain, and erythematous, tender metacarpophalangeal joints are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a systemic, inflammatory, autoimmune condition that primarily affects the synovial joints. The most specific test for RA is the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, which has a specificity of around 95-98% for RA. Synovial fluid analysis can be helpful in differentiating inflammatory from non-inflammatory arthritis but is not as specific for RA. Rheumatoid factor is less specific than anti-CCP for RA, as it can be positive in other autoimmune diseases and in healthy individuals. An X-ray of the cervical spine would not be the most helpful initial diagnostic test in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody\"}"
