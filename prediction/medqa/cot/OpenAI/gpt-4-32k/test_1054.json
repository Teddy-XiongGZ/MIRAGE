    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of pain, weakness, and the inability to slowly lower his arm from an overhead position suggest a rotator cuff injury. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. The supraspinatus muscle is most commonly injured, but the patient's specific symptoms of weakness in external rotation and the inability to abduct the arm suggest an injury to the infraspinatus muscle, which is responsible for these movements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
