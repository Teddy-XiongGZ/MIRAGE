    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and irregular periods, along with the physical exam findings of suprapubic and right lower quadrant tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass, are suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is often caused by sexually transmitted infections, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which fits with the patient's history of multiple sexual partners and inconsistent use of barrier protection. The treatment for PID depends on the severity of the disease. Mild to moderate disease can be treated with outpatient antibiotics, while severe disease requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Given the patient's severe symptoms and the presence of a tender adnexal mass, which suggests a tubo-ovarian abscess, this patient likely has severe PID and should be admitted for intravenous antibiotics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission\"}"
