    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It works by blocking the CCR5 co-receptor on the surface of the host's T cells, preventing the virus from entering the cell.

Therefore, none of these options are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
