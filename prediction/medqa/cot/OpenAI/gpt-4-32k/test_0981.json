    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine, which is known to cross the blood-brain barrier due to its lipophilic nature, leading to sedation. Fexofenadine, on the other hand, is a second-generation antihistamine. Second-generation antihistamines are less sedating because they are less lipophilic and therefore do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. This characteristic is referred to as relative lipophobicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Relative lipophobicity\"}"
