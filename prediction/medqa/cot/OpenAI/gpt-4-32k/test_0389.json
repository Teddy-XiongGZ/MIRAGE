    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include weakness and loss of vibration sense and light touch in the left lower extremity, and loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. This pattern of symptoms is consistent with Brown-Sequard syndrome, which is caused by hemisection of the spinal cord. In this syndrome, the side of the body where the cord is damaged (ipsilateral side) experiences weakness and loss of proprioception and vibration sense, while the opposite side (contralateral side) experiences loss of pain and temperature sensation. Since the patient's left side is experiencing weakness and loss of proprioception, the lesion must be on the left side of the spinal cord.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Left cord hemisection\"}"
