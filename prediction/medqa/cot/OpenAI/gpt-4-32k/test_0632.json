    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, especially when lying on her left side, unexplained loss of consciousness, diastolic murmur, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary congestion all point towards a cardiac issue. The echocardiogram showing a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum further supports this. Rheumatic fever usually presents with a history of strep throat and migratory joint pain, which is not mentioned here. Innocent murmur is usually asymptomatic and found in children. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is usually seen in patients with malignancy or autoimmune disease, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Atrial myxoma is a benign tumor of the heart, often located in the left atrium and attached to the atrial septum, which matches the findings in the echocardiogram. It can cause symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath and pulmonary congestion, and can also cause syncope due to obstruction of blood flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Atrial myxoma\"}"
