    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of right upper abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and leukocytosis are suggestive of acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. This condition is most commonly caused by obstruction of the cystic duct, typically by a gallstone. The patient's obesity is a risk factor for gallstone disease. The cholescintigraphy findings are consistent with this diagnosis, as they show the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel, but not the gallbladder, suggesting that the cystic duct is obstructed. The other options are less likely: autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma would suggest acute pancreatitis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or lab findings; a fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine would typically present with different symptoms and imaging findings; and infection with a hepatotropic virus would not explain the patient's acute symptoms and would typically cause elevations in AST and ALT, which are not seen here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Obstruction of the cystic duct\"}"
