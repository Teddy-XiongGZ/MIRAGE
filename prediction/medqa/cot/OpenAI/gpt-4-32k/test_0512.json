    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is pregnant and has a history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with methimazole. However, methimazole is a category D drug in pregnancy, meaning there is positive evidence of human fetal risk. Propylthiouracil, on the other hand, is a category D drug in the first trimester but a category B drug in the second and third trimesters, meaning there is no evidence of risk in later stages of pregnancy. Therefore, it is safer to switch the patient to propylthiouracil during her pregnancy. Glucocorticoids are not typically used to manage hyperthyroidism, and radioiodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy because it can cross the placenta and affect the fetal thyroid gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil\"}"
