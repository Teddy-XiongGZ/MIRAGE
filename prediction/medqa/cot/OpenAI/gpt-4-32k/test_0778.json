    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has set a limit of 80 hours per week, averaged over a four-week period, for resident work hours. This includes both in-program work and moonlighting (external work). The resident in the question is currently working 70 hours per week (60 hours in residency and 10 hours moonlighting). Therefore, he is already working within the ACGME guidelines and does not need to reduce his hours. However, he cannot work up to 20 more hours as this would exceed the 80-hour limit. He is also not prohibited from working outside his residency training, as long as the total hours worked do not exceed the limit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
