    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of breathlessness, difficulty in walking a few blocks, and a dry, hacking cough, along with the physical examination finding of inspiratory crackles over the lung bases, suggest a restrictive lung disease. This is further supported by his history of amiodarone use, which is known to cause pulmonary toxicity leading to interstitial lung disease, a type of restrictive lung disease. In restrictive lung diseases, both the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) are reduced, but the reduction is more in FVC, leading to a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio\"}"
