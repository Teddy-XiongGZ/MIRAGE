    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, change in voice quality, and uvula deviation are suggestive of peritonsillar abscess, a complication of acute tonsillitis. This condition is typically managed with needle aspiration or incision and drainage to remove the pus, along with antibiotics to treat the underlying infection. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy is used to reduce inflammation and swelling, but it does not address the underlying infection or abscess. Intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy alone would not be sufficient as it does not address the abscess. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to drain the abscess and administer antibiotics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy\"}"
