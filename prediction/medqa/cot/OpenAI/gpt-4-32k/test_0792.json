    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of insomnia, which include difficulty initiating sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings. This is affecting her daily life as she is making mistakes at work, has trouble concentrating, and feels sleepy throughout the day. Looking at the options, Chlordiazepoxide and Diazepam are both benzodiazepines, but they have a long half-life and can cause daytime sedation and cognitive impairment, which is not suitable for this patient as she already has trouble concentrating and is making mistakes at work. Modafinil is a stimulant used to treat narcolepsy and would not be appropriate for treating insomnia. Triazolam, on the other hand, is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is commonly used to treat insomnia. It helps to decrease the time to sleep onset and increase the duration of sleep.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Triazolam\"}"
