    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's reaction to the blood transfusion suggests an allergic reaction, which is typically mediated by IgE antibodies. However, the patient's history does not indicate any known allergies, suggesting that this reaction may be due to an underlying immunodeficiency disorder. In such cases, the patient's immune system may overreact to foreign substances, leading to an increase in IgE levels. Therefore, we would expect to see high IgE levels in this patient's serum. The levels of other immunoglobulins such as IgA and IgG would likely be normal, as there is no indication of any other immune system abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. High IgE, normal IgA, and IgG\"}"
