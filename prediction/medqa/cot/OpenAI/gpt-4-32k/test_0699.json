It works by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and improving muscle strength. Physostigmine is used to treat anticholinergic toxicity, not myasthenia gravis. Hydrocortisone is a steroid medication used to treat a variety of conditions, including adrenal insufficiency and inflammatory conditions, but it is not the first-line treatment for myasthenia gravis.
