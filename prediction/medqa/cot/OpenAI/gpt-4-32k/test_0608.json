    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, including self-mutilation, facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements, along with the fact that he has been taking allopurinol, suggest a diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This is a rare inherited disorder characterized by self-mutilation, motor dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which plays a key role in the purine salvage pathway. The purine salvage pathway is responsible for the recycling of purines in the body. When HGPRT is deficient, purines are not recycled and instead are converted into uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia. Allopurinol is a medication used to treat hyperuricemia, which further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the answer is C. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
