    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. It works by competing with acetylcholine for binding sites at the neuromuscular junction, thereby preventing muscle contraction. It does not reduce neuron and muscle tissue excitability, increase GABA linked chloride channel opening, or act on the pain centers in the spinal cord and brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction\"}"
