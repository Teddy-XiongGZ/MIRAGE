    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-year-old female who has not yet menstruated, which is a condition known as primary amenorrhea. She has normal secondary sexual characteristics, which indicates that she has normal functioning ovaries and is producing estrogen. This is confirmed by her normal FSH and estradiol levels. The presence of lower abdominal pain could suggest a structural abnormality. Given that she has normal secondary sexual characteristics and normal hormone levels, but has not menstruated, the most likely diagnosis is a condition where the uterus or vagina is absent or underdeveloped. This is known as Muellerian agenesis. Conditions like hyperprolactinemia, Turner syndrome, and androgen insensitivity are less likely given the normal hormone levels and presence of secondary sexual characteristics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
