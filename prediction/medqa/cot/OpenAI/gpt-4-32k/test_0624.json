    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms such as tachycardia, hypotension, dilated pupils, dry skin, and urinary retention (as suggested by the distended abdomen and dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region) are consistent with an anticholinergic toxidrome, which is caused by medications such as tricyclic antidepressants (eg, nortriptyline). The ECG findings of a widened QRS complex (>100 ms) suggest sodium channel blockade, another toxic effect of tricyclic antidepressants. Sodium bicarbonate is the treatment of choice for tricyclic antidepressant overdose because it can alleviate both the sodium channel blockade (thereby narrowing the QRS complex) and the anticholinergic effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sodium bicarbonate\"}"
