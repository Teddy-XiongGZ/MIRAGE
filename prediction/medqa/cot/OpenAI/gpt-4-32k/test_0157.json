    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of hepatosplenomegaly and milky blood sample that forms a creamy supernatant layer after refrigeration is indicative of hyperlipidemia, specifically hypertriglyceridemia. The mutation in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2) further supports this, as APOC2 is necessary for the activation of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides. When this enzyme is deficient, triglycerides accumulate, leading to the observed symptoms. The most common complication of severe hypertriglyceridemia is acute pancreatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Acute pancreatitis\"}"
