    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This scenario describes a case series, which is a descriptive study that reports on a group of patients with a similar exposure and/or outcome. Case series are useful for generating hypotheses about rare diseases or adverse events, but they do not include a comparison group. Therefore, they cannot test hypotheses, calculate relative risks or odds ratios, or control for confounding variables. The pediatrician is simply observing and reporting on a group of patients with a similar outcome (paralysis after a flu-like illness), without comparing them to a control group or testing a specific hypothesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
