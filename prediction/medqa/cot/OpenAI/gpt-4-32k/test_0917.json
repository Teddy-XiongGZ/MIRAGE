    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms of sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis are consistent with hypoglycemia, which is confirmed by the low serum glucose levels. The high insulin levels during the episode of decreased consciousness suggest that insulin is being administered exogenously, as the body would not normally produce insulin in the setting of hypoglycemia. The low C-peptide levels further support this, as C-peptide is co-secreted with insulin by the pancreas, and would be expected to be high if the insulin was being produced endogenously. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another, formerly known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, where a caregiver induces or fabricates illness in another person under their care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
