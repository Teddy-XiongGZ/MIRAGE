    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of confusion, somnolence, polyuria, and weight loss, along with the laboratory findings of hypercalcemia (Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL) and low PTH (8 pg/mL), suggest a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. This is a paraneoplastic syndrome often seen in patients with lung, breast, kidney, or multiple myeloma cancers. The best long-term prophylaxis for hypercalcemia of malignancy is bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, which inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, thereby reducing serum calcium levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Alendronate\"}"
