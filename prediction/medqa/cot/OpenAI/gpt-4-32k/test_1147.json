    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has type 1 diabetes and is currently experiencing an upper respiratory infection. Illness, stress, and infection can increase the body's demand for insulin as they increase the levels of stress hormones which counteract insulin's effect, leading to higher blood glucose levels. Therefore, reducing or holding insulin is not advisable in this situation as it could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. Continuing the same regimen might not be sufficient to manage the increased blood glucose levels due to the infection. Therefore, the best approach would be to monitor blood glucose levels more frequently to adjust the insulin dose as needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
