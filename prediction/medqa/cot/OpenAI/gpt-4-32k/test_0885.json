    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe headache, slurred speech, drooping of the left side of her mouth, and decreased strength in her left upper extremity are suggestive of a stroke. The fact that these symptoms occurred after she took her usual medication for headaches and did not improve, and then worsened after receiving dihydroergotamine, makes a medication reaction less likely. Psychogenic symptoms are also less likely given the physical findings. Between hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, the sudden onset of symptoms and the severe headache are more suggestive of a hemorrhagic stroke, which often presents with a 'thunderclap' headache and rapidly progressing neurological symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hemorrhagic stroke\"}"
