The most common findings are a heliotrope rash (an erythematous rash on the eyelids) and proximal muscle weakness. The diagnosis of dermatomyositis is usually confirmed by muscle biopsy, which shows inflammation and damage.

In this case, a serum ANA titer would be a good initial test, as it can help confirm the presence of an autoimmune disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Serum ANA titer\"}"
