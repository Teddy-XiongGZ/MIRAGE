    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The baby's symptoms such as poor weight gain, irritability, tachycardia, and neck swelling are suggestive of hyperthyroidism. The mother's history of Graves' disease is also a significant clue. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs) that bind to and stimulate the TSH receptor, leading to overproduction of thyroid hormones. These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause transient neonatal Graves' disease. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies, while also associated with Graves' disease, do not cause hyperthyroidism. Transplacental viral infection and opiate use in the mother are not associated with these symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies\"}"
