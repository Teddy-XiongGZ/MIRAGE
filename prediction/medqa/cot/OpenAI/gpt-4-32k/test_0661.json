    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and echocardiography findings suggest a congenital heart defect, specifically a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSDs are typically characterized by a harsh, holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. The murmur is caused by blood flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle through the septal defect. The maneuvers described in the answer choices can affect the intensity of heart murmurs. Hand clenching (choice A) increases systemic vascular resistance, which would increase the intensity of murmurs associated with aortic stenosis or regurgitation, but not a VSD. Forced exhalation against a closed glottis (choice B), also known as a Valsalva maneuver, decreases venous return to the heart, which would decrease the intensity of most murmurs, but increase the intensity of murmurs associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An opening snap followed by a diastolic murmur (choice C) is characteristic of mitral stenosis, not a VSD. A continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound (choice D) is characteristic of a patent ductus arteriosus, not a VSD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
