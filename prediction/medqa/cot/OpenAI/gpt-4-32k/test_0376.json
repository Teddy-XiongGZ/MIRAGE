    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant's symptoms of productive cough, watery stools, failure to gain weight, and white plaques in the mouth (which are indicative of oral thrush) suggest a possible immunodeficiency. The presence of lymphadenopathy could also be a sign of an ongoing infection. The fact that the infant has not received any immunizations and was born at home without any prenatal care raises the possibility of a vertically transmitted infection. Among the options, a DNA test for CFTR mutation would be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which doesn't fit the clinical picture here. Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes would be used for genetic disorders, which also doesn't seem to be the case. A fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test is used to diagnose syphilis, which doesn't match the symptoms. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral genes would be used to identify a viral infection, which seems to be the most likely given the symptoms and history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
