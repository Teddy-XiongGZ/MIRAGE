    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of skin lesions, thickening of the skin, and loss of sensation in the extremities are indicative of leprosy, a disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This bacterium is known to be acid-fast due to the high lipid content in its cell wall, which resists decolorization by acids during staining procedures. The other options do not fit with the clinical picture. Catalase-negative bacteria are usually streptococci, which do not cause these symptoms. Thermophiles are bacteria that thrive at relatively high temperatures, not a characteristic specific to any bacteria causing human disease. Tennis-racket shaped bacteria refer to Clostridium perfringens, which is associated with gas gangrene and food poisoning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
