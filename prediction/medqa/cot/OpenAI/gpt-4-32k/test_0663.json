    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body, without motor weakness or reflex changes, suggest a lesion affecting the spinothalamic tract. The spinothalamic tract carries pain and temperature sensations from the body to the brain. The lateral medulla is the location where these fibers decussate or cross over to the other side of the brain. Therefore, a lesion in the lateral medulla would cause contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation, as seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lateral medulla\"}"
