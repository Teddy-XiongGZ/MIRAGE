    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's chest pain worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate, which is an antacid. This suggests that the pain is related to acid reflux or heartburn, rather than a heart condition. An ECG is normal, which further supports this. A partially occluded coronary artery would likely cause symptoms that worsen with exertion, not with meals. An umbilical hernia would cause abdominal pain, not chest pain. Intestinal metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction is a condition associated with Barrett's esophagus, which can cause heartburn, but it's a more specific diagnosis than is warranted by the information given. The most likely cause, given the symptoms, is gastroesophageal junction incompetence, which would allow stomach acid to reflux into the esophagus and cause heartburn.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
