    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are suggestive of diverticulitis with abscess formation. Diverticulitis is an inflammation of the diverticula, which are small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of the digestive system, often in the lower part of the colon. When one of these pouches becomes inflamed or infected, it can result in diverticulitis. The abscess is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body, in this case, the colon. The formation of an abscess is a result of the body's defense mechanism against infection. When the body detects bacterial infection, it sends white blood cells to the area to kill the bacteria. Over time, the dead bacteria, white blood cells, and tissue debris accumulate to form pus. The substance responsible for this process is the lysosomal enzymes released by the white blood cells to kill the bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lysosomal enzymes\"}"
