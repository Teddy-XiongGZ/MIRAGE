    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of nonproductive cough, fatigue, and significant weight loss, along with the finding of a nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the lung on chest x-ray, are suggestive of lung cancer. The patient's lack of smoking history makes squamous cell carcinoma less likely, as it is strongly associated with smoking. Adenocarcinoma, on the other hand, is the most common type of lung cancer in non-smokers. Carcinoid tumors are typically slow-growing and often asymptomatic, which does not align with the patient's rapid weight loss and fatigue. Sarcoidosis usually presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which is not seen in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Adenocarcinoma of the lung\"}"
