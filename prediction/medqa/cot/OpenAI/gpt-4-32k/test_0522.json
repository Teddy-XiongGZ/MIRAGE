    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and absence of flatus or bowel movements suggest a bowel obstruction. The presence of high-pitched bowel sounds and distention further support this. The patient's history of abdominal surgery is significant because adhesions are a common cause of small bowel obstruction, especially in patients without a history of hernias. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form between abdominal tissues and organs, often as a result of surgery. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease, ibuprofen, and alcohol can all cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but they are less likely to cause a mechanical obstruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
