    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation and lab results suggest a hemolytic anemia, specifically hereditary spherocytosis. This is suggested by the normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, increased RDW, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, negative Coombs test, and increased osmotic fragility. Hereditary spherocytosis is a condition where the red blood cells are sphere-shaped instead of the normal biconcave disk shape, making them more prone to hemolysis. Therefore, if a blood smear were obtained, we would expect to see spherocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Spherocytes\"}"
