    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has given birth to a stillborn baby with no visible malformations and an unremarkable placenta. The cause of death is unknown. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Karyotyping of amniotic fluid (choice A) would not be helpful as the baby has already been born and there are no visible malformations. Obtaining photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI (choice C) would not provide information about the cause of death. Parental genetic testing (choice D) could be considered later if the autopsy does not reveal a cause of death and there is a suspicion of a genetic disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Recommend autopsy of the infant\"}"
