    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The treatment of celiac disease is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet, which leads to resolution of the diarrhea, often within days. However, in severe cases, diarrhea and malabsorption may persist for a time even after starting a gluten-free diet. In such cases, the use of anti-diarrheal agents such as diphenoxylate can be beneficial.

Prednisone is a steroid and is not typically used for the treatment of diarrhea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Diphenoxylate\"}"
