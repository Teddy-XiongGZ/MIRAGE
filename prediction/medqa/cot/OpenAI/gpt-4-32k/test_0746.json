    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, diaphoresis, increased reflexes, and clonus suggest serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by an excess of serotonin in the brain. This can be caused by a variety of drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram, which the patient is taking. The recent addition of an amino acid supplement could have exacerbated this condition, as tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin. However, the patient switched from paroxetine to citalopram 6 months ago and her mood has been stable, which makes a medication change a less likely cause. Decreased carbohydrate intake and opiate abuse are not typically associated with serotonin syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increased tryptophan intake\"}"
