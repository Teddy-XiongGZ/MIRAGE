    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemosiderin is an iron-storage complex. It is usually found within cells and appears to be a breakdown product of hemoglobin. Hemosiderin is most commonly found in macrophages and is especially abundant in situations following hemorrhage. Hemosiderin is formed in the lysosomes of these cells, where it is contained so it doesn't cause damage to the cell. Therefore, the cellular organelle significant in the formation of heart failure cells (hemosiderin-containing macrophages) is the lysosome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Lysosomes\"}"
