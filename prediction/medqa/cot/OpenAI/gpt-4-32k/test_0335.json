    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's sudden loss of consciousness during physical exertion suggests a cardiac cause. The physical examination findings of a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse, a double apical impulse, and an S4 sound are all indicative of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This condition can cause sudden cardiac death in young people, especially athletes, due to ventricular arrhythmias. Aortic stenosis usually presents with a systolic murmur, which is not present in this case. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often triggered by severe stress, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is less common and usually presents with signs of right heart failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\"}"
