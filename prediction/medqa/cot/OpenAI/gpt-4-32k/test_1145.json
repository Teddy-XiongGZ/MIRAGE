    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a young woman with a painless, mobile, rubbery mass in her breast. The biopsy shows overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue. This is not consistent with normal pregnancy-related changes, which would typically involve generalized breast enlargement and tenderness. Fat necrosis would typically present as a hard, irregular mass often associated with trauma or surgery, and the biopsy would show necrotic adipose tissue, not fibrous and glandular overgrowth. Phyllodes tumor is a possibility, but it is less common than fibroadenoma and often presents as a rapidly enlarging mass, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is fibroadenoma, which is a benign breast tumor composed of both glandular and fibrous tissue and is common in young women.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Fibroadenoma\"}"
