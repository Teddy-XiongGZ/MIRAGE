    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an enzyme that bacteria use to replicate their DNA. If a colony of E. coli is resistant to ciprofloxacin, it's most likely because the bacteria have mutated their DNA gyrase in a way that prevents the antibiotic from binding to it. The other options, such as replacement of D-alanine, inactivation by bacterial transferase, and modification of surface binding proteins, are mechanisms of resistance to other types of antibiotics, not fluoroquinolones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mutation of DNA gyrase\"}"
