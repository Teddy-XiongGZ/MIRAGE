    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of periorbital edema and lower extremity edema, along with the history of a recent upper respiratory infection, suggest a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. The effacement of podocytes seen on electron microscopy is also consistent with this diagnosis. In nephrotic syndrome, the damaged glomerular filtration barrier allows proteins, particularly albumin, to pass into the urine. Fatty casts, also known as lipiduria, can be seen in the urine due to the hyperlipidemia associated with nephrotic syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fatty casts and albumin\"}"
