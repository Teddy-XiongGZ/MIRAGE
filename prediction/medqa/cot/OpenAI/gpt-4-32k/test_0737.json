    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and irregularly irregular heart rhythm suggest atrial fibrillation. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that is often used to control the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. It does not block beta-adrenergic receptors or calcium channels, and while it does increase ventricular contractility, this is not the primary mechanism by which it controls heart rate in atrial fibrillation. Instead, digoxin primarily works by increasing vagal tone, which slows the conduction of electrical impulses through the atrioventricular node and thus reduces the heart rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Vagal stimulation\"}"
