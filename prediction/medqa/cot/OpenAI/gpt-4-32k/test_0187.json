    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a medication that can reduce the need for opioids in a patient with severe pain due to metastatic lung cancer. The medication should interact with the NMDA-receptor. Propofol and Midazolam are anesthetics and sedatives, they do not interact with the NMDA-receptor. Fentanyl is an opioid, so it wouldn't reduce the need for opioids. Ketamine, on the other hand, is a known NMDA receptor antagonist and is used as an adjuvant in pain management to reduce the need for opioids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ketamine\"}"
