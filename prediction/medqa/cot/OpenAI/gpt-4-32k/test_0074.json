    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of pruritus and a hypopigmented rash that started as a single lesion and spread to other areas of his body suggest a fungal infection, specifically tinea versicolor. This condition is caused by the yeast Malassezia, which is part of the normal skin flora but can overgrow in certain conditions, such as warm and humid environments like the Bahamas. The yeast produces azelaic acid, which inhibits tyrosinase, leading to hypopigmentation. A Wood lamp examination can help visualize the rash, but it is not definitive. A skin culture is not typically used to diagnose tinea versicolor. A skin biopsy is invasive and not necessary for this diagnosis. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is the best choice because it can confirm the diagnosis by showing the characteristic 'spaghetti and meatballs' appearance of the yeast and hyphae of Malassezia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
