    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes two newborns with different weights and different physical characteristics, which suggests that they are not identical twins. Identical twins would be monozygotic and would share the same genetic material, leading to similar physical characteristics. The fact that one of the newborns has a higher hematocrit could suggest twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which occurs in monochorionic pregnancies. However, the significant difference in weight and physical characteristics between the two newborns makes this less likely. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that these are non-identical twins, which would be dizygotic and have separate chorions and amnions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dichorionic-diamniotic dizygotic\"}"
