    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, along with the findings of narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms on fundoscopic examination, suggest diabetic retinopathy. This is a common complication of long-standing diabetes. The pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy involves the accumulation of sorbitol within cells due to high glucose levels. This is because glucose is converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. In tissues where the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase is not highly expressed, such as the lens, nerves, and kidneys, sorbitol cannot be further metabolized and thus accumulates, leading to osmotic damage and the clinical manifestations of diabetic complications. Therefore, the tissue specific differences in expression of sorbitol dehydrogenase are likely causing this patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Sorbitol dehydrogenase\"}"
