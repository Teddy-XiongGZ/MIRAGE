    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The drug described in the question is a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker. It also has potassium channel blocking activity, anticholinergic activity, and alpha-blocking activity. The side effects of sodium channel blockers can include CNS effects like dizziness and headache, but tinnitus is not a common side effect. Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits are side effects associated with amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, not class I. Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity are also side effects associated with amiodarone. The alpha-blocking activity of the drug can cause vasodilation, which can lead to pedal edema and flushing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pedal edema and flushing\"}"
