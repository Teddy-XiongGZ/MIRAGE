    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that is often used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It works by blocking the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the smooth muscles of the bronchi in the lungs, preventing bronchoconstriction and increasing airflow. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is coupled to the G protein, which when activated, leads to the activation of phospholipase C. This enzyme then cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), both of which act as second messengers. Therefore, by blocking the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, ipratropium bromide affects the phosphoinositol system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Phosphoinositol system\"}"
