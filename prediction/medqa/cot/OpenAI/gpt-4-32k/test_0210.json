    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle. It primarily functions to prevent the cell from entering S phase from G1 phase. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a protein that, when activated, phosphorylates the Rb protein, causing it to release its inhibition on the cell cycle progression. Therefore, a drug that activates CDK4 would likely lead to the initiation of S phase by releasing the Rb protein's inhibition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Initiation of S phase\"}"
