    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of intermittent flank pain, history of recurrent urinary tract infections, hypertension, and bilateral upper abdominal masses are suggestive of a kidney disorder. The renal ultrasonography findings of bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses further support this. Medullary sponge kidney typically presents with nephrolithiasis or urinary tract infections, but it does not cause enlarged kidneys. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood, and it often leads to kidney failure in children. Obstructive cystic dysplasia is usually unilateral and associated with other urinary tract anomalies. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, which often presents in adulthood with hypertension, abdominal pain, and recurrent urinary tract infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
