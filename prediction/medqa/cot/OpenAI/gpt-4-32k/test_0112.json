    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's chief complaint is retrosternal burning associated with eating, which is a classic symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is caused by the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus, which can cause a burning sensation. This is typically due to a decrease in lower esophageal sphincter tone, which normally prevents the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. The other options do not fit with the patient's symptoms. Esophageal fibrosis is typically associated with conditions like systemic sclerosis, not GERD. Increased lower esophageal tone would actually prevent reflux, not cause it. A spastic cricopharyngeal muscle would cause difficulty swallowing, not heartburn.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Decreased lower esophageal tone\"}"
