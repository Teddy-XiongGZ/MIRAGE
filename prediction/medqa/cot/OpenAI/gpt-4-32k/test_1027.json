    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the volume of distribution for this patient. The volume of distribution is given as 60 mL/kg, and the patient weighs 50 kg. So, the volume of distribution for this patient is 60 mL/kg * 50 kg = 3000 mL. The target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL. To achieve this concentration in the volume of distribution, we need to administer a dose of 0.5 units/mL * 3000 mL = 1500 units.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 1,500 units\"}"
