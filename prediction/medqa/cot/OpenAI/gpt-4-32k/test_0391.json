    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a condition known as Beck's triad, which is characterized by hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds. This is often seen in cardiac tamponade, a medical emergency where fluid in the pericardium builds up and results in an increased intrapericardial pressure, which in turn reduces venous return to the heart. The inability to palpate the radial pulse during inspiration is known as pulsus paradoxus, which is a sign of severe cardiac tamponade. The next step in management should be to relieve the pressure on the heart. Pericardiocentesis is the procedure of choice in this situation, as it involves the removal of fluid from the pericardium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Pericardiocentesis\"}"
