    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Arginine is a precursor for the production of nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator and is produced by the endothelial cells of the blood vessels. If there is a decrease in the concentration of arginine in these cells, it could be due to its increased utilization for the production of nitric oxide. The other options do not directly relate to the metabolism or utilization of arginine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased production of nitric oxide\"}"
