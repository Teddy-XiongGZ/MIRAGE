    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms such as acute-onset chest pain, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, anxiety, agitation, dilated pupils, and a perforated nasal septum suggest the use of a stimulant drug, likely cocaine. Cocaine is known to cause these symptoms and is often snorted, which can lead to a perforated nasal septum. Despite the patient's denial of illicit drug use, his symptoms and lifestyle suggest otherwise. Cocaine works by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which leads to an increase in the levels of these neurotransmitters. This results in the stimulation of the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system, leading to the symptoms observed in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine\"}"
