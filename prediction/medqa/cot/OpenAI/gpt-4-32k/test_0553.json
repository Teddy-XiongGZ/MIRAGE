    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's doctor suspects elevated aldosterone levels, which suggests a condition like primary aldosteronism. Aldosterone receptor antagonists are used to treat this condition. Spironolactone and Eplerenone are both aldosterone receptor antagonists. However, Spironolactone is known to cause side effects like gynecomastia and impotence, which the patient is concerned about. Eplerenone, on the other hand, is a more selective aldosterone receptor antagonist and has a lower risk of these side effects. Triamterene and Ethacrynic acid are diuretics but they do not specifically target aldosterone receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Eplerenone\"}"
