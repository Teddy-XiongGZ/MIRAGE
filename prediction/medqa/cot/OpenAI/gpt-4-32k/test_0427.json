    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Miglitol is an oral anti-diabetic drug that belongs to the class of medications known as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Alpha-glucosidase is an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars in the small intestine. It does this by cleaving glycosidic bonds. Therefore, when a patient takes miglitol, the drug inhibits alpha-glucosidase and prevents the cleavage of glycosidic bonds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Glycosidic bonds\"}"
