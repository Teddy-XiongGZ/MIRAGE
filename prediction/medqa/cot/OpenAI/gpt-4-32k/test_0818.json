    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, recurrent fetal loss, and thrombotic events is suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity in the presence of persistent antiphospholipid antibodies. Pregnancy morbidity includes one or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation, one or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before the 34th week of gestation because of eclampsia or severe preeclampsia, or three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. The mainstay of treatment for pregnant patients with APS is low-dose aspirin and heparin. Warfarin is teratogenic and should not be used in pregnancy. Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant and is not recommended in pregnancy due to lack of safety data.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Aspirin and heparin\"}"
