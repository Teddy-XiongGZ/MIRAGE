Nabothian cysts are mucus-filled cysts that appear on the surface of the cervix. They are usually small, firm, non-tender, and may have a yellow hue. They are caused by the blockage of the cervical glands and are often asymptomatic. No treatment is necessary for Nabothian cysts unless they cause symptoms or are unusually large. The patient is asymptomatic and the cyst is small, so no further intervention is needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. No further intervention\"}"
