    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, double vision, fatigue, drooping of the eyelids, and inability to hold his arms up for longer than 3 minutes are suggestive of myasthenia gravis, a condition often associated with thymomas. The CT scan showing an anterior mediastinal mass with smooth contours further supports this diagnosis. The thymus, where thymomas originate, is the site of T-cell maturation. During this process, thymocytes (immature T cells) undergo both positive and negative selection to ensure that they can recognize self-MHC molecules and do not react with self-antigens, respectively. Therefore, the immunologic process that normally occurs in the region indicated by the arrow (the thymus) is negative selection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Negative selection\"}"
