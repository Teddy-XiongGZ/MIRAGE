    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to preserving an amputated part is to keep it cool and moist. Submerging the finger directly in ice water can cause further damage to the tissue due to freezing. Wrapping the finger in moist gauze alone would keep it moist but not cool. Submerging the finger in ice water after wrapping it in moist gauze would again risk freezing the tissue.

This keeps the finger cool and moist without direct contact with ice or water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
