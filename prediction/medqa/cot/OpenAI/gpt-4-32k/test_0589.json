    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, severe right flank pain, and the ultrasound findings of a large simple cyst on the right ovary with no flow detected in the right ovarian vein suggest ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary twists around its ligamentous support, often due to an ovarian mass, such as a cyst, causing obstruction of venous outflow and arterial inflow. The ligament that is most likely involved in ovarian torsion is the infundibulopelvic ligament, also known as the suspensory ligament of the ovary, which carries the ovarian vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Infundibulopelvic ligament\"}"
