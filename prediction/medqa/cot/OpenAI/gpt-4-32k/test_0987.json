    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of developmental delay, seizures, fair complexion (pale skin and blue eyes), and musty odor are suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or its cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. This deficiency leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine, which is toxic to the brain and can cause intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological problems.

Therefore, the answer is dietary restriction of phenylalanine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine\"}"
