    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and joint pain, along with her recent travel history to Africa, suggest a vector-borne illness. The absence of ring-form trophozoites on the peripheral blood smear rules out malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and is a common cause of fever in travelers returning from Africa. Babesia babesia also presents with ring-form trophozoites, so it can be ruled out. Leishmania major primarily causes cutaneous lesions, which this patient does not have. Dengue virus is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, but it is not commonly found in Africa. Chikungunya virus, on the other hand, is endemic in Africa and causes symptoms similar to those seen in this patient, including fever, rash, and severe joint pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
