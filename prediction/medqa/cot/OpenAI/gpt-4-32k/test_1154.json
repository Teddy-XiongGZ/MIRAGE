    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The DEXA scan results are usually reported in T-scores and Z-scores. The T-score compares the patient's bone density with that of a healthy 30-year-old of the same sex. A T-score of -1.0 to -2.5 indicates osteopenia, which is a condition of lower than normal bone density that may lead to osteoporosis. A T-score of -2.5 or lower indicates osteoporosis. The Z-score compares the patient's bone density with that of other people of the same age and sex. A Z-score of -2.0 or lower is considered abnormal. Therefore, the most likely DEXA scan result for this patient with osteopenia would be a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. T-score of -1.6\"}"
