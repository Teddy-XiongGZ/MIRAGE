    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's age and the presence of a painless testicular mass suggest a testicular tumor. The elevated AFP level is a key clue, as it is typically elevated in non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, such as yolk sac tumors and teratomas. However, the biopsy results show glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells. This is characteristic of a yolk sac tumor, also known as endodermal sinus tumor. Classic seminomas and choriocarcinomas do not typically present with elevated AFP levels, and teratomas would show tissue from all three germ layers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Yolk sac tumor\"}"
