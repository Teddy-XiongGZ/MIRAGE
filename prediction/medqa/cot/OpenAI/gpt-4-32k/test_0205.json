    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The spleen plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in fighting encapsulated bacteria. Therefore, after a splenectomy, patients are at an increased risk of infection from encapsulated organisms. The most common of these are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Therefore, patients who have had a splenectomy should receive vaccines against these organisms. Tetanus is not related to the function of the spleen, and Hepatitis B is a viral infection, not a bacterial one, so these vaccines are not necessary in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
