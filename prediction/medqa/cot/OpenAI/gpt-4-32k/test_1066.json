    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of inhalational anthrax, which is caused by Bacillus anthracis. This bacterium is often found in soil and can contaminate animal products, such as the sheep wool and hide the patient works with. The key virulence factors of B. anthracis are its poly-D-glutamate capsule and anthrax toxins. The capsule is unique because it is composed of poly-D-glutamate, which is not immunogenic and allows the bacterium to evade the host's immune response. Therefore, the glutamate capsule is the virulence factor that increases its survival in host tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Glutamate capsule\"}"
