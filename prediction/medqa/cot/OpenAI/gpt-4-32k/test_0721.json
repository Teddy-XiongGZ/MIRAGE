    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, along with the MRI findings of isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle, suggest a condition called obstructive hydrocephalus. This condition occurs when the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is blocked somewhere along its pathway. The CSF is produced in the lateral ventricles, then flows through the interventricular foramen to the third ventricle, then through the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle, and finally exits the ventricular system through the median and lateral apertures to circulate around the brain and spinal cord. If the dilation is only in the left lateral ventricle, the blockage must be at the interventricular foramen, which connects the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Interventricular foramen\"}"
