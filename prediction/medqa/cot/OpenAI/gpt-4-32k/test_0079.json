    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a penetrating chest wound that has caused a full thickness injury to the right ventricular free wall. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate surgical intervention. A cardiac transplant (option A) is not feasible in this acute setting. Watchful waiting (option B) is not appropriate given the severity of the injury. A needle thoracostomy (option D) is used to relieve tension pneumothorax, which is not the primary issue in this case. The best approach would be to repair the ventricular wall injury directly, which can be done using an interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets (option C). This type of suture is strong and non-absorbable, making it suitable for cardiac repair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
