    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and the presence of anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies suggest that he has hepatitis A, a viral infection. The increased expression of MHC class I molecules on infected cells is a response to the presence of the virus. This is primarily induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune response to viral infections. IFN-\u03b3 is known to upregulate MHC class I expression, which allows for increased presentation of viral antigens to cytotoxic T cells. Among the options, the one that is also a function of IFN-\u03b3 is the upregulated expression of exogenously synthesized antigens (option A). This is because IFN-\u03b3 enhances antigen processing and presentation, which includes the presentation of exogenously synthesized antigens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
