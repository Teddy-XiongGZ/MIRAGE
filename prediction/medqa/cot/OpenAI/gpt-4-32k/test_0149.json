    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Staphylococcus aureus, the causative agent of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, is a gram-positive bacterium. The primary immune response to bacterial infections typically involves the production of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. These are the first antibodies to be produced in response to an initial exposure to an antigen. The other immunoglobulins, IgG, IgD, and IgA, have different roles. IgG is involved in secondary immune responses, IgD is involved in B cell activation, and IgA is primarily found in mucosal areas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Immunoglobulin- IgM\"}"
