Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. It is characterized by chorea (involuntary jerking or writhing movements), progressive motor impairment, and cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. The primary area of the brain affected in Huntington's disease is the striatum, which is responsible for movement and behavior control. Therefore, the MRI of a patient with Huntington's disease would most likely show atrophy of the striatum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Atrophy of the striatum\"}"
