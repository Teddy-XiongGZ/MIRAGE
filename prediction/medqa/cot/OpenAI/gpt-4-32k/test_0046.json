    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The number needed to treat (NNT) is a measure that indicates how many patients need to be treated with a particular therapy to prevent one additional bad outcome. It is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). ARR is the difference in the event rates between control and treatment groups. In this case, the event is death from cardiac causes. The event rate for Medication 1 is 134/1500 = 0.0893 and for Medication 2 is 210/1500 = 0.14. The ARR is 0.14 - 0.0893 = 0.0507. Therefore, the NNT is 1/0.0507 = 19.72, which rounds to 20.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
