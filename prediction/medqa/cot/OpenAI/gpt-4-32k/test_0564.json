    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of weak tumescence and low libido are likely side effects of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs are known to cause sexual dysfunction in some patients. Lowering the dose of citalopram (option A) may not alleviate these side effects. Switching to another SSRI like fluoxetine (option C) is also not likely to help, as sexual dysfunction is a class effect of SSRIs. Selegiline (option D) is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and is not typically used for anxiety disorders. The best option would be to add bupropion (option B), an atypical antidepressant that has been shown to counteract sexual side effects of SSRIs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
