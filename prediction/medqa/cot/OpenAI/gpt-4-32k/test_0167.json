This condition is also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress and is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction. Atrial fibrillation would typically present with an irregularly irregular pulse, which is not mentioned in the case. Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy would typically present with signs of right heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema, which are also not mentioned in the case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
