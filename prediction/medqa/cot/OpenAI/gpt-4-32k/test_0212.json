    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cohort study is a type of observational study that involves two groups\u2014an exposed group and a non-exposed group\u2014and follows them over time to see how the rates of a certain outcome (like a disease or condition) differ between the two groups. In this case, there is no comparison group, and the study is simply following a single group of patients over time to see what happens. This is more characteristic of a case series, which is a type of observational study that tracks patients who have a certain condition or who receive a certain treatment over time, without a comparison group. Therefore, the editor suggested the authors to submit their study as a case series instead of a cohort study.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Low number of patients\"}"
