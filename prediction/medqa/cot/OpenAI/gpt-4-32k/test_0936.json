    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are suggestive of appendicitis. The fact that the pain is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated is a sign of rebound tenderness, which is a classic sign of peritoneal irritation often seen in appendicitis. The next best step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis. An abdominal radiograph is not sensitive or specific enough for appendicitis. A \u00df-hCG test is used to confirm pregnancy, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms. A stool occult blood test is used to detect gastrointestinal bleeding, which is also not suggested by the patient's symptoms. A CT scan, however, is a sensitive and specific test for appendicitis and would be the best next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. CT scan\"}"
