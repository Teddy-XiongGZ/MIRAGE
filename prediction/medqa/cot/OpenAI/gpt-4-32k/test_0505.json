    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium fluoroacetate is a pesticide that is converted to fluorocitrate in the body. Fluorocitrate is a potent inhibitor of aconitase, an enzyme in the citric acid cycle. Aconitase catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate. Therefore, if aconitase is inhibited, citrate will accumulate in the cells because it cannot be converted to isocitrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Citrate\"}"
