    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain, along with the physical findings of a holosystolic heart murmur and erythematous lesions on the palms and soles, are suggestive of infective endocarditis. The presence of vegetations on the mitral valve on echocardiography further supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of frequent lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a recent colonoscopy finding of an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer is important. Streptococcus bovis is known to be associated with colorectal neoplasia and can cause infective endocarditis. The other organisms listed are also potential causes of endocarditis, but the association with colorectal neoplasia makes Streptococcus bovis the most likely causative agent in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Streptococcus bovis\"}"
