    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cross-bridge cycle in muscle contraction involves several steps. First, the myosin head binds to the actin filament, forming a cross-bridge. Then, the myosin head pivots, pulling the actin filament inward, a process known as the power stroke. After the power stroke, the myosin head remains bound to actin until it binds a new molecule of ATP. The binding of ATP causes the myosin head to release actin. The ATP is then hydrolyzed, and the energy released is used to 'cock' the myosin head, preparing it for another cycle. If a drug inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head, it would prevent the myosin head from returning to its 'cocked' position, thus blocking the power stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Power stroke\"}"
