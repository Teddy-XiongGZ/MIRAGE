    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of obesity, acne, hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, and impaired glucose tolerance are suggestive of an endocrine disorder. Hypothyroidism can cause weight gain, but it does not typically cause hirsutism or acne. Idiopathic hirsutism is characterized by excessive hair growth without other signs of androgen excess, which does not fit with this patient's presentation. Ovarian hyperthecosis is a rare condition that typically presents in postmenopausal women, not in younger women like this patient. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is characterized by hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism), ovulatory dysfunction (irregular menstrual cycles), and polycystic ovaries. Obesity and insulin resistance are also commonly associated with PCOS, which fits with this patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\"}"
