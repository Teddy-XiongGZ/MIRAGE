    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a potentially life-threatening disorder caused by massive cell lysis with the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids into the systemic circulation. Uric acid is a product of purine metabolism and can precipitate in the renal tubules, leading to acute kidney injury. The patient's elevated potassium, uric acid, and creatinine levels, along with his symptoms, are indicative of TLS. The most effective way to prevent TLS is through aggressive hydration, which promotes renal elimination of these substances. Allopurinol and rasburicase are used to lower uric acid levels, but they do not address the hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia seen in TLS. Urine alkalinization is no longer recommended due to the risk of calcium phosphate precipitation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Intravenous hydration\"}"
