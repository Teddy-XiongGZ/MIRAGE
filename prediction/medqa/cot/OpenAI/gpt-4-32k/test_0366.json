    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of episodic chest pain with transient ST elevations on ECG during the episodes suggest a diagnosis of Prinzmetal angina, also known as variant angina. This condition is characterized by transient coronary artery spasm, often occurring at rest, and can cause transient ST elevations on ECG. The mechanism behind this condition is vasospasm, which is also the mechanism behind Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by episodic vasospasm in the fingers and toes, often in response to cold or stress. Myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and costochondritis have different mechanisms and do not involve vasospasm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Raynaud's phenomenon\"}"
