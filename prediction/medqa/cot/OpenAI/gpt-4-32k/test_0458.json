    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's heart rate and blood pressure increased after exercise. This is a normal physiological response to exercise. The body needs to pump more blood to the muscles during exercise, which is achieved by increasing the heart rate and blood pressure. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for this 'fight or flight' response, increasing heart rate and blood pressure. The baroreceptor reflex is involved in maintaining blood pressure, but it would not cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Vagal nuclei activation would actually decrease heart rate, not increase it. Vasopressin release from the pituitary would increase water reabsorption in the kidneys, but it would not directly increase heart rate and blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Sympathetic nervous system activation\"}"
