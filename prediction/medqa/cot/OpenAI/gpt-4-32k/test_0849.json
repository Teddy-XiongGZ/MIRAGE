    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chemotherapy, such as etoposide, often causes nausea and vomiting due to its effect on the area postrema. The area postrema is a part of the brain that controls vomiting. It is located in the medulla oblongata and is not protected by the blood-brain barrier, which makes it susceptible to circulating toxins such as chemotherapy drugs. Metoclopramide, an antiemetic, works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, including those in the area postrema, thereby reducing the urge to vomit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Area postrema\"}"
