    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Postoperative hyperalgesia, or an increased sensitivity to pain, can occur after surgery, especially in patients with a history of chronic opioid use. This is because chronic opioid use can lead to changes in the central nervous system that increase pain sensitivity. Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has been shown to reduce the risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia. Midazolam, propofol, and etomidate are all sedatives used in anesthesia, but they do not have the same effect on pain sensitivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Ketamine\"}"
