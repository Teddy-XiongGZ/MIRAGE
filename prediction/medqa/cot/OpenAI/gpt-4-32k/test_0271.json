    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's dipstick test showed 1+ glucose, which indicates the presence of glucose in the urine, a condition known as glycosuria. This can be a sign of diabetes, but it can also occur in pregnancy due to the physiological changes that increase the renal threshold for glucose. The patient's fasting glucose level is normal, which makes diabetes less likely. However, to confirm the cause of the glycosuria, a urinalysis would be the most appropriate next step. This test can provide more information about the presence of glucose in the urine and can also detect other abnormalities that may be present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Urinalysis\"}"
