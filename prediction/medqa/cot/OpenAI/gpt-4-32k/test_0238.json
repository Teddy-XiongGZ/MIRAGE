    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that develop in a population during a specific time period, while prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a specific point in time. Therefore, the incidence rate would not necessarily be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods, as it depends on the number of new cases, not the length of the time period. The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows would not necessarily be overestimated, as prevalence is a measure of all cases at a specific point in time, not over a period of time. The inclusion of attack rates, which refer to the number of new cases of a disease in a population at risk during a specific time period, would not necessarily increase incidence estimates in longer time periods or decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods, as attack rates and incidence rates measure similar concepts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
