    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of diabetes and recent surgery, along with the clinical presentation of wound dehiscence, necrotic tissue, and pus, suggest a wound infection. The CT findings of a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues further support this. The first step in managing a wound infection with necrotic tissue is surgical debridement, which involves removing the dead tissue to promote healing and prevent further infection. Negative pressure wound management, sternal wiring, and sternal fixation may be considered later in the treatment process, but they are not the immediate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
