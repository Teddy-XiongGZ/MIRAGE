    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of palpitations, racing and pounding heart, and the ECG findings suggest that he is likely suffering from atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for stroke, as the irregular heart rhythm can lead to the formation of blood clots in the heart that can then travel to the brain. Given the patient's history of ischemic stroke, it is important to manage this risk. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents that can reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but they are less effective than anticoagulants such as warfarin. Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove plaque from the carotid artery and is typically used in patients with carotid artery stenosis, which this patient does not have. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention to prevent future cerebrovascular accidents in this patient would be to start him on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and heparin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Begin warfarin and heparin\"}"
