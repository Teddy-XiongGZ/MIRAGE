    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin, an anticoagulant. The goal of warfarin therapy is to prevent thromboembolic events, such as stroke, in patients with atrial fibrillation. The effectiveness and safety of warfarin therapy are monitored by the International Normalized Ratio (INR). An INR in the therapeutic range (2.0-3.0 for most indications, 2.5-3.5 for mechanical heart valves) indicates that the patient's warfarin dose is appropriate. Therefore, to assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in this patient, an INR should be ordered.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. International normalized ratio\"}"
