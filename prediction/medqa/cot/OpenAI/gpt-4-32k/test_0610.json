This can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies. However, her anti-D antibody screen is currently negative, indicating she has not yet developed these antibodies. The best management for such patients is to administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks gestation and again after delivery if the newborn is Rh positive. This will prevent the mother from developing anti-D antibodies. The antibody screen should also be repeated at 28 weeks to ensure that the mother has not developed antibodies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks.
