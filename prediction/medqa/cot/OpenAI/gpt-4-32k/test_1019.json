    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime somnolence, loud snoring, and not feeling refreshed despite adequate sleep hours suggest obstructive sleep apnea. The polysomnogram results confirm this with episodes of apnea and hypopnea. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is calculated by adding the number of apnea and hypopnea episodes and dividing by the number of hours of sleep. In this case, (12 apnea + 30 hypopnea) / 7 hours = 6, which is more than 5. Therefore, the statement that the patient's AHI is more than 5 is correct. The other options are either incorrect or not directly related to the patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
