    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a compound that decreases urinary sodium and pH while increasing urinary potassium. This suggests that the compound is causing the kidney to retain sodium and hydrogen ions while excreting more potassium. This is the action of aldosterone, a hormone that acts on the principal cells of the kidney's collecting ducts to increase sodium reabsorption, hydrogen ion secretion, and potassium excretion. Therefore, the compound X is likely to be aldosterone and the cells it acts on are the principal cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Principal cells; aldosterone\"}"
