    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible pulmonary embolism. He has several risk factors, including a sedentary job as a long-haul truck driver, recent long-distance travel, smoking, and multiple comorbidities. However, the question asks for the most reasonable first step in ruling out PE in a low-risk patient. An ECG is not specific or sensitive enough for PE. A V/Q scan and CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast are both imaging studies that are more invasive and carry risks of radiation exposure. They are typically used when there is a high suspicion of PE. A D-dimer test, on the other hand, is a blood test that can help rule out PE. It is often used as a first step in low-risk patients because it is non-invasive and has a high negative predictive value. If the D-dimer level is normal, it is unlikely that the patient has a PE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. D-dimer\"}"
