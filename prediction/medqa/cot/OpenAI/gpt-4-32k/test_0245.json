    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH within normal range, indicating no acid-base disturbance. However, the pO2 is low, indicating hypoxemia. The patient is already on a ventilator with an FiO2 of 50%, but this is not providing sufficient oxygenation. The presence of bilateral rales on lung examination suggests the presence of pulmonary edema, which can impair gas exchange. Increasing the FiO2 would provide more oxygen, but it would not address the underlying issue of impaired gas exchange due to pulmonary edema. Increasing the tidal volume would not necessarily improve oxygenation and could potentially cause barotrauma. Increasing the respiratory rate could potentially improve oxygenation, but it could also lead to respiratory alkalosis. Increasing the PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) would help to keep the alveoli open at the end of expiration, improving gas exchange and oxygenation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increase PEEP\"}"
