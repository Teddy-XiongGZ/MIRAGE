    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that results in the body being unable to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. High levels of phenylalanine can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. In pregnant women with PKU, high levels of phenylalanine can also harm the developing fetus, even if the fetus has not inherited the PKU gene. This is known as maternal PKU. Therefore, it is important for women with PKU who wish to become pregnant to maintain low phenylalanine levels. This is typically achieved through a strict diet that is low in phenylalanine. The diet should be started before conception and maintained throughout pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL\"}"
