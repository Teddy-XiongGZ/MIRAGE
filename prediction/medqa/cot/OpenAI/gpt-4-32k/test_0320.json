    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of ulcerative colitis, along with her symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and a distended, rigid abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, suggest a severe exacerbation of her condition, possibly toxic megacolon. This is a life-threatening complication of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by nonobstructive colonic dilation and systemic toxicity. The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest systemic toxicity. In this situation, the most appropriate next step is to confirm the diagnosis with imaging. A plain abdominal x-ray is usually the first-line imaging modality in suspected toxic megacolon, as it can show colonic dilation and rule out perforation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
