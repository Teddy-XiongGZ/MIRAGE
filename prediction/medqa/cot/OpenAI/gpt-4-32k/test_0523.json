    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that primarily affects the colon and rectum. It is characterized by continuous mucosal damage, starting from the rectum and extending proximally. The inflammation is limited to the mucosa and submucosa, unlike Crohn's disease, which is transmural. Involvement of the terminal ileum and noncaseating granulomas are more characteristic of Crohn's disease, not ulcerative colitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Continuous mucosal damage\"}"
