    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resistance to blood flow in a vessel is determined by Poiseuille's law, which states that resistance is directly proportional to the length of the vessel and the viscosity of the blood, and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. In this case, the radius of the vessel has been reduced by 50%, which means the radius is halved. Therefore, the resistance to blood flow has increased by a factor of (1/0.5)^4 = 16.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
