    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient has bipolar I disorder and is currently on lithium. Lithium is associated with a small risk of cardiac malformations (eg, Ebstein anomaly) in infants if used during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. However, the risk of relapse in bipolar disorder is high if medication is stopped, so it's important to balance the risks and benefits. Valproate is not a good choice as it is associated with neural tube defects, cognitive impairment, and other congenital malformations. Polytherapy is generally avoided in pregnancy due to increased risk of teratogenicity. Adjusting the dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy might be necessary, but it's not the most helpful recommendation in minimizing the risk to the fetus. The most effective way to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in any pregnancy is to supplement with folic acid. This is especially important in patients taking medications with potential teratogenic effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid\"}"
