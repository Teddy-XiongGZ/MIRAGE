    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires that any patient presenting to an emergency department be provided with a medical screening examination and be stabilized before transfer or discharge. If a patient is in active labor, EMTALA requires that the labor be completed at the hospital before the patient is discharged or transferred, unless a transfer is requested by the patient or her representative. In this case, the patient and her husband have requested a transfer to a more capable center. Therefore, the hospital should stabilize the patient, inform her of the risks of transfer, and then transfer her if she still insists and makes a written request.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
