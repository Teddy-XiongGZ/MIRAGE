    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation therapy works by damaging the DNA in cells. The cells then become unable to divide and grow, leading to cell death. The main effect of radiation is to cause breaks in the DNA strands. Thymidine dimers are caused by UV light, not radiation. Disulfide bonds are not directly related to radiation damage. Deamination of cytosine is a spontaneous mutation that can occur in DNA, but it is not directly induced by radiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
