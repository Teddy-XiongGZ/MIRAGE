    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of significant sun exposure and the rapid development of a pink bump on his forehead are key clues. The physical examination reveals a dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug, which is characteristic of keratoacanthoma. The histological findings of an exophytic nodule with central invagination filled with keratin and minimal keratinocyte atypia further support this diagnosis. Basal cell carcinoma usually presents as a pearly papule with telangiectasias and often ulcerates, which is not described here. Seborrheic keratosis typically presents as a waxy, stuck-on lesion and is not associated with sun exposure. Kaposi's sarcoma is a vascular tumor that presents as red or purple patches, plaques, or nodules, which is not consistent with the presentation in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Keratoacanthoma\"}"
