    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of abnormal coagulation tests and the current presentation of a hot, swollen, erythematous knee following trauma suggest a bleeding disorder. The coagulation tests show a normal bleeding time and prothrombin time, but an increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT). This indicates a problem with the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. The intrinsic pathway includes factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. The decreased bradykinin formation suggests a defect in Factor XII, as it is involved in the kallikrein-kinin system, which leads to the formation of bradykinin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Factor XII\"}"
