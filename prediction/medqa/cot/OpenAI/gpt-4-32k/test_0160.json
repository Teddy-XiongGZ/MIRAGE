    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The spleen plays a crucial role in the immune response, particularly against encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The spleen is divided into two main regions: the red pulp (which filters the blood of antigens, microorganisms, and defective or worn-out red blood cells) and the white pulp (which contains immune cells such as T cells and B cells and initiates immune responses). The white pulp is further divided into the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS, T-cell zone) and the follicle (B-cell zone). The marginal zone, which separates the red pulp from the white pulp, contains macrophages and B cells and is the area where the blood-borne pathogens are first encountered and an immune response is initiated. Therefore, dysfunction of both the white pulp (1) and the marginal zone (2) would predispose the patient to infections by encapsulated bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1 and 2\"}"
