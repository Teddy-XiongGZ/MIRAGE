    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain that worsens with inspiration, recent long-distance travel, and the physical examination findings of decreased air movement in the right lung and tachycardia are suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). In pregnant patients, the preferred initial imaging study for suspected PE is a chest radiograph followed by a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan if the radiograph is normal. An ECG is not specific or sensitive for PE. A CT pulmonary angiogram, while highly sensitive and specific for PE, involves a higher radiation exposure to the breast tissue and fetus and is typically reserved for cases where the V/Q scan is non-diagnostic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. V/Q scan\"}"
