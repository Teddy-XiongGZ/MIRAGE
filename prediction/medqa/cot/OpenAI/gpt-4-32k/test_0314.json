    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes are indicative of allergic rhinitis. The medication given to her would likely be aimed at reducing these symptoms. Alpha-adrenergic agonists are commonly used to relieve nasal congestion, as they cause vasoconstriction and reduce blood flow in the nasal passages. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors is a mechanism of action for drugs used to treat conditions like asthma and COPD, but not typically for allergic rhinitis. Disruption of disulfide bonds is a mechanism of action for drugs like mucolytics, which are used to break down mucus in conditions like cystic fibrosis. Short acting beta-2 agonists are used for acute relief of asthma symptoms, not allergic rhinitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Alpha-adrenergic agonist\"}"
