    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is often caused by stomach acid refluxing into the esophagus. The patient was initially on cimetidine, which is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, but his symptoms have worsened. The next step in treatment would be to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which works by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme in the stomach's parietal cells. This reduces the production of stomach acid, alleviating the symptoms of GERD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells\"}"
