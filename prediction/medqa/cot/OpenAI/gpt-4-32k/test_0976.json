At this stage, the most appropriate method for elective termination of pregnancy is a medical abortion, which involves the use of medications. The combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is commonly used for this purpose. Mifepristone blocks the effects of progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy, and misoprostol induces uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy.
