    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's dry cough could be a side effect of the ACE inhibitor he is taking, which is lisinopril. ACE inhibitors can cause a persistent dry cough in some patients. The next step would be to switch the patient to a different class of antihypertensive medication that does not have this side effect. Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which is not the first-line treatment for hypertension, especially in a patient with asthma. Lovastatin is a statin, like atorvastatin, and is not related to cough. Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, both are good alternatives for patients who develop cough from ACE inhibitors. However, ARBs are often preferred as they have a similar mechanism of action to ACE inhibitors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Change lisinopril to losartan\"}"
