    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old female with a round, mobile mass in her breast that enlarges and becomes tender before her menses. This is most likely a fibroadenoma, which is a benign breast tumor common in young women. Fibroadenomas are hormone-sensitive, hence the increase in size and tenderness before menses. They do not increase the risk of breast cancer. Oral contraceptives do not typically cause fibroadenomas to decrease in size. Fibroadenomas can sometimes decrease in size or disappear over time, especially after menopause, but this is less likely in a young woman. Rapid growth of a fibroadenoma to greater than 5 cm is unusual and would not typically be treated with radiation and chemotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
