    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of painful double vision that occurs only when looking sideways, along with an adduction deficit in one eye and nystagmus in the other eye when looking in either direction, are indicative of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). INO is a disorder of conjugate lateral gaze in which the affected eye shows impairment of adduction. When the patient looks to the side opposite the affected eye, the affected eye does not move past the midline. This is due to a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which coordinates both eyes by connecting the abducens nucleus of one side to the oculomotor nucleus of the opposite side. The most common cause of INO in young patients is multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disorder. The other options, such as a compressive tumor of the pons, oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency, and infarction of the brainstem, do not typically present with these specific symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus\"}"
