These findings suggest that the patient is genetically male (XY) but has a disorder that prevents the normal development of male secondary sexual characteristics. Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition that results in the partial or complete inability of the cell to respond to androgens. The unresponsiveness of the cell to the presence of androgenic hormones prevents the masculinization of male genitalia in the developing fetus, as well as the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty, but does allow for normal female secondary sexual development. The inguinal mass is likely an undescended testis, which is common in AIS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Androgen insensitivity\"}"
