    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history and physical examination suggest a scaphoid fracture, which is a common injury following a fall on an outstretched hand. The scaphoid bone is located in the anatomical snuffbox, and tenderness in this area is a classic sign of a scaphoid fracture. However, these fractures are often not visible on initial x-rays. Therefore, the patient should be treated as if she has a scaphoid fracture until proven otherwise. This involves immobilization of the thumb and wrist to prevent further injury. A thumb spica cast is typically used for this purpose. A repeat x-ray in 2 weeks is also necessary because scaphoid fractures often become visible on x-ray after some time has passed. Corticosteroid injections and percutaneous pinning are not appropriate initial treatments for a suspected scaphoid fracture. Rest and ice alone would not provide adequate immobilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks\"}"
