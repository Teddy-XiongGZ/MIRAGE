    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of recurrent venous thromboses at a young age, in the absence of any known risk factors, suggests an inherited thrombophilia. The most common inherited thrombophilias include factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin. Factor V Leiden mutation, which is the most common inherited thrombophilia in Caucasians, results in resistance to activated protein C, an anticoagulant that normally degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa. Therefore, the pathophysiology of this patient's condition is most likely resistance to clotting factor degradation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
