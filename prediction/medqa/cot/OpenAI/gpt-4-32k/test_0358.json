    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with nursemaid's elbow, also known as radial head subluxation. This is a common injury in young children and typically occurs when a child is lifted or swung by their arms. The child will often hold the arm in a slightly flexed and pronated position and refuse to use it. The next step in management is reduction of the subluxation. This can be done by either the hyperpronation method or the supination-flexion method. The hyperpronation method has been shown to be more successful on the first attempt than the supination-flexion method.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Moderate flexion then hyperpronation\"}"
