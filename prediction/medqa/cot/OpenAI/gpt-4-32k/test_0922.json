    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers suggest an underlying immunodeficiency. The presence of pus in the skin lesions indicates that the patient's immune system is capable of forming neutrophilic responses, which rules out conditions like chronic granulomatous disease where there is a defect in neutrophil function. Atopic dermatitis is a type of eczema that is often associated with other atopic diseases like asthma, but it does not typically cause recurrent infections or fevers. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent pyogenic infections, and a bleeding tendency due to platelet dysfunction. However, the patient does not have any signs of albinism or bleeding. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immunodeficiency. The recurrent infections, eczema-like skin lesions, and the fact that the patient is a boy (making him more likely to have an X-linked disorder) make this the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome\"}"
