However, the absence of fever and bloody stools, as well as the presence of a painful rash that resolved spontaneously, are more suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. It is often associated with stress and can present with a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, constipation, or a combination of both. The presence of mucoid strings in the stool is also a common finding in IBS. Importantly, IBS does not cause inflammation or changes in bowel tissue, so the intestinal mucosa would appear normal on examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Normal intestinal mucosa\"}"
