    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of leg swelling, difficulty walking, and proteinuria suggest nephrotic syndrome, likely secondary to lupus nephritis given her history of systemic lupus erythematosus. The subsequent finding of hematuria and bladder mucosa oozing with neovascularization suggests hemorrhagic cystitis. This condition is often caused by chemotherapeutic agents, particularly cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Mesna is a medication that is used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis in patients receiving these chemotherapeutic agents. It works by binding to the toxic metabolites of these drugs and preventing them from causing bladder damage. Therefore, the use of Mesna could have prevented the patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mesna\"}"
