    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was found with empty bottles of vodka and a half-empty container of antifreeze, which suggests that he may have consumed antifreeze. Ethylene glycol, the active ingredient in most antifreeze solutions, is metabolized in the body to oxalic acid, which can combine with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals. These crystals can precipitate in the kidneys and cause acute kidney injury, which is consistent with the patient's elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels. Therefore, we would expect to find calcium oxalate crystals in the patient's urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Calcium oxalate crystals\"}"
