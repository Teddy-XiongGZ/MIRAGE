    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are proteins produced by the immune system to fight against foreign substances like bacteria, viruses, and other harmful substances. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. The only immunoglobulin that is found as a dimer is IgA. IgA is primarily found in areas of the body such as the nose, breathing passages, digestive tract, ears, eyes, and vagina, which are areas frequently exposed to foreign substances. The primary function of IgA is to prevent the adherence and colonization of pathogens on mucous membranes, thus protecting these areas from infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
