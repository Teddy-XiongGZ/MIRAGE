Given the patient's skin and joint symptoms, as well as the familial pattern, the most likely diagnosis is psoriatic arthritis. Gout typically presents with acute, severe pain in a single joint, often the big toe, which doesn't match this patient's presentation.

Dermatomyositis typically presents with a rash and muscle weakness, which is also not described in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Psoriatic arthritis\"}"
