    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anesthesiologist has administered an anesthetic to the pudendal nerve, which is located near the ischial spines. This nerve provides sensory innervation to the posterior vulva, perineum, and distal third of the anal canal. It also provides motor innervation to the external anal sphincter. Therefore, the anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies the external anal sphincter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. External anal sphincter\"}"
