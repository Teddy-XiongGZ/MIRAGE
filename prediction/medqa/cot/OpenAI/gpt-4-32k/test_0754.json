    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, along with nausea and vomiting, are suggestive of a biliary tract issue. The presence of multiple gallstones on the ultrasound further supports this. The normal liver on ultrasound and the absence of wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid makes acute cholecystitis less likely. The elevated total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT, along with the dilated common bile duct, suggest obstruction of the biliary tract, most likely due to a stone, which is known as choledocholithiasis. Acute hepatitis A would typically present with more systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and jaundice, and pancreatitis would typically present with more constant and severe abdominal pain, often radiating to the back, and would likely show abnormalities on ultrasound.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Choledocholithiasis\"}"
