    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and RSV pneumonia suggest a problem with the immune system. The negative HIV test rules out that condition. The patient's young age and the presence of both viral (RSV pneumonia) and fungal (oral candidiasis) infections suggest a problem with T cell function, as T cells are crucial for combating both types of pathogens. Grossly reduced levels of B cells would primarily affect the body's ability to produce antibodies and fight bacterial infections, which is not the main issue here. Defective isotype switching and selective IgA deficiency would also primarily affect antibody production and are less likely to result in the broad range of symptoms seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Defective T cell function\"}"
