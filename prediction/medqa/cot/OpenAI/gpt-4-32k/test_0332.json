    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and high serum digoxin level suggest digitalis toxicity. Verapamil, which was recently added to his medication regimen, is known to inhibit P-glycoprotein, a transporter protein that helps in the elimination of digoxin from the body. Therefore, the inhibition of P-glycoprotein by verapamil could have led to an increased concentration of digoxin in the patient's body, resulting in toxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\"}"
