    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It works by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon secretion, and slowing gastric emptying. However, it is not typically used in type 1 diabetes because these patients have little to no insulin production, and exenatide's mechanism of action relies on the presence of insulin. Additionally, exenatide can cause weight loss due to its appetite-suppressing effects, which would not be beneficial for this patient who is already struggling to gain weight. However, the most important reason not to use exenatide in this case is that it is not approved for use in children under 18 years of age.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Exenatide is contraindicated in children below 18 years.\"}"
