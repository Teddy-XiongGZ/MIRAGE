    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a lump under his left nipple, which is tender to touch. He has no other symptoms such as breast discharge. His medical history includes cryptorchidism and ADHD, and he is currently on medication for ADHD. His physical exam shows that he is in the normal range for height, weight, and BMI, and he is in the Tanner IV stage of puberty. His testicular volume is normal, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile. The breast exam shows a normal right breast and a 3-centimeter round, firm, and slightly tender discrete mass under the left nipple. This presentation is consistent with gynecomastia, which is common in adolescent boys and is due to the imbalance of estrogen and testosterone during puberty. Klinefelter syndrome is unlikely because the patient does not have other symptoms such as small testes, tall stature, or learning disabilities. Lipomastia or pseudogynecomastia is due to the accumulation of fat in the breast area, which is not the case here as the patient has a normal BMI. Testicular cancer is unlikely because the patient's testes are normal on examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Glandular tissue enlargement\"}"
