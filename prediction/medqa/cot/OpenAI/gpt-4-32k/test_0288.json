    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of fever, irritability, and neck rigidity suggests a recent episode of meningitis, which can cause inflammation and scarring of the arachnoid granulations. These granulations are responsible for the reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the venous system. If they become impaired, CSF can accumulate, leading to increased intracranial pressure and symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and vomiting, especially in the morning. The MRI findings of ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space also suggest an accumulation of CSF. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's condition is impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations\"}"
