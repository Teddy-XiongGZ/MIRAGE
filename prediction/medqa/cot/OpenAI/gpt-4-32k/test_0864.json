    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with a traumatic injury to the abdomen, likely the spleen given the left upper quadrant pain. The sonography confirms hemoperitoneum, indicating internal bleeding. Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient's vitals show signs of shock (tachycardia, hypotension), suggesting ongoing blood loss. A normal saline bolus (option A) has already been tried without improvement. A CT scan (option B) would be useful for further diagnosis, but the patient's unstable condition makes immediate intervention necessary. Morphine (option C) would only manage the pain but not address the underlying issue. Therefore, the best next step is an exploratory laparotomy (option D) to identify and control the source of bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
