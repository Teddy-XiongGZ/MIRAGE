    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and exposure history suggest a possible rubella infection. However, her serology results indicate that she is not currently infected with rubella. The presence of IgG antibodies and their high avidity suggest a past infection or vaccination, and the decrease in IgG titer from 1:128 to 1:64 indicates that this is not a recent infection. Therefore, the patient is not at risk of transmitting rubella to her fetus. However, since she cannot confirm her vaccination history, it would be prudent to recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum to prevent future infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
