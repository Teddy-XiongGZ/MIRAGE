    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was treated with an antimycobacterial drug for a positive tuberculin skin test, which indicates a latent tuberculosis infection. The most commonly used first-line drug for latent tuberculosis is isoniazid. A known side effect of isoniazid is peripheral neuropathy, which is caused by the drug's interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism. This leads to a deficiency of pyridoxine, which is necessary for the synthesis of myelin. Therefore, the patient's symptoms of numbness, burning, and unsteady gait, along with decreased sensation to light touch, are indicative of peripheral neuropathy due to segmental demyelination of peripheral axons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons\"}"
