    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of bruising and petechiae suggest a bleeding disorder. The normal complete blood count rules out thrombocytopenia, which would be seen in conditions like acute lymphoblastic leukemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The normal prothrombin time (PT) and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) suggest a defect in the intrinsic or common coagulation pathway. Von Willebrand disease typically presents with mucocutaneous bleeding and would also prolong the PT, which is not seen in this patient. Hemophilia A is a disorder of the intrinsic pathway, characterized by a deficiency in factor VIII, which would prolong the aPTT but leave the PT normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hemophilia A\"}"
