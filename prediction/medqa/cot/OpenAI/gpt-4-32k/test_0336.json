The brain biopsy showing perivascular clusters of lymphocytes is indicative of an inflammatory response, which is often seen in viral infections. Among the options provided, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is known to cause CNS infections, including encephalitis and meningitis. Human herpes virus can also cause CNS infections, but it is usually associated with a more severe clinical picture, including fever, which this patient does not have.
