    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ribosome is the site of protein synthesis in a cell. Proteins that are destined for secretion from the cell are synthesized on ribosomes that are bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum has this name because it appears 'rough' under a microscope due to the presence of ribosomes on its surface. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum, on the other hand, lacks ribosomes and is involved in lipid metabolism and detoxification processes. The cytosol contains free ribosomes that synthesize proteins for use within the cell. The nucleus is the site of DNA and RNA synthesis, not protein synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
