    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of progressive facial swelling without pain, erythema, or lymphadenopathy, along with difficulty chewing, suggest a problem with the salivary glands. The absence of neurological deficits and fever rules out an infectious cause like paramyxovirus. The absence of lymphadenopathy and the slow progression of symptoms make a malignant tumor less likely. A benign cystic tumor with stroma resembling lymph node tissue would not typically cause these symptoms. Therefore, a benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue is the most likely cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
