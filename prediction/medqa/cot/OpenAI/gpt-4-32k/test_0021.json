    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant's symptoms of coughing and difficulty breathing during feeding, decreased energy, and a high-pitched holosystolic murmur heard best at the lower left sternal border are suggestive of a congenital heart defect. The murmur described is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is the most common congenital heart defect. VSDs can occur as isolated defects or as part of a syndrome. The options provided suggest genetic syndromes or teratogenic exposures. 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome) is associated with conotruncal defects, not VSDs. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7 causes Williams syndrome, which is associated with supravalvular aortic stenosis. Lithium exposure in utero can cause Ebstein anomaly. Maternal alcohol consumption can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which is associated with a variety of congenital defects, including VSDs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Maternal alcohol consumption\"}"
