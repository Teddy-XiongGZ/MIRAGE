    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has 90% occlusion of the right renal artery, which would lead to decreased renal blood flow. This would stimulate the juxtaglomerular apparatus, specifically the juxtaglomerular cells, to release renin in an attempt to increase blood pressure and improve renal perfusion. The juxtaglomerular cells are located in the afferent arteriole and are responsible for renin secretion in response to decreased renal perfusion. Over time, chronic stimulation of these cells can lead to their hyperplasia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells\"}"
