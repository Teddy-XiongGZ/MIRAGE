    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was struck by a high-voltage power line, which can cause significant internal damage, including rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle tissue breaks down and releases a protein called myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can cause kidney damage. The patient's bilateral flank pain could be a sign of kidney injury. A urinalysis can detect the presence of myoglobin in the urine, which would confirm rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, the first diagnostic test should be a urinalysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
