    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of alcoholism and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine suggest a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol, found in antifreeze, can be consumed as a substitute for alcohol and is metabolized in the body to oxalic acid, which combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals. This process can lead to acute kidney injury, which would explain the patient's decreased urination and flank pain. Ethylene glycol poisoning also causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of its toxic metabolites.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Anion gap metabolic acidosis\"}"
