    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rifampin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including oral contraceptives. The mechanism of action of rifampin involves the induction of these enzymes, which leads to an increased metabolism of the hormones in oral contraceptives, thereby reducing their effectiveness. The hormones affected are both estrogens and progestins. However, the option that mentions the induction of CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins, is the most accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.\"}"
