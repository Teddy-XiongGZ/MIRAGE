    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with dysmenorrhea, which is severe menstrual cramping. This is a common condition in adolescent females. The patient's symptoms are typical of primary dysmenorrhea, which is menstrual pain without an identifiable pelvic pathology. It is often associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and usually begins within a few years of menarche, once ovulatory cycles have been established. The pain is usually most severe on the first day of menses and often is accompanied by systemic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the first-line treatment for dysmenorrhea because they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reducing myometrial contractions, and decreasing menstrual flow. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest secondary causes of dysmenorrhea (eg, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease), which would warrant further investigation with imaging.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. NSAIDs\"}"
