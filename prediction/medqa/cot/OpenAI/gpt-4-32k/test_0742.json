    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cardiac complications that the infant of a mother with type 1 diabetes mellitus is at high risk for. It's important to note that maternal diabetes, especially with poor glycemic control as indicated by the high HbA1C level, is associated with several fetal complications. One of these complications is cardiomyopathy. However, the type of cardiomyopathy associated with maternal diabetes is transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The other options, Tetralogy of Fallot and Mitral valve prolapse, are not directly associated with maternal diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\"}"
