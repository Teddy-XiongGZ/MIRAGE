    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss, along with the family history of type 2 diabetes, suggest that he has diabetes. The HbA1c level of 9% confirms this diagnosis. In diabetes, blood glucose levels are high, which leads to an increased amount of glucose being filtered by the kidneys. Normally, all of this glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules by secondary active transporters, specifically sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs). However, when the blood glucose levels are too high, as in diabetes, these transporters become saturated and can't reabsorb all of the glucose, leading to glucosuria. This is not due to a disruption of the transporters, but rather their inability to handle the high glucose load.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules\"}"
