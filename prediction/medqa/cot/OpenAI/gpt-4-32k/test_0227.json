    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest metabolic acidosis, as indicated by the low pH and bicarbonate levels. The normal anion gap (Na - (Cl + HCO3) = 136 - (115 + 14) = 7 mEq/L) suggests a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The decreased urine output and low potassium level suggest renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Amphotericin B is known to cause renal toxicity, including RTA, which would explain the patient's findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Amphotericin B\"}"
