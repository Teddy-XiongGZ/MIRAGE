    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. This is often caused by a gallstone lodged in the cystic duct. The patient's history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain after meals is suggestive of biliary colic, which is a precursor to acute cholecystitis. The ultrasound findings of a dilated common bile duct without any stones in the common bile duct or gallbladder further support this diagnosis. The elevated white blood cell count and fever indicate an active infection. The elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest some degree of biliary obstruction. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to relieve the obstruction and treat the infection. This is typically done via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which allows for both visualization and removal of the obstructing stone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
