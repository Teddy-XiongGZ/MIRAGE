    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of alcoholism, presentation with hematemesis and melena, and physical examination findings of splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave suggest a diagnosis of cirrhosis with portal hypertension. The endoscopic findings of bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus are consistent with esophageal varices, a complication of portal hypertension. The acute bleed was managed with IV fluids and octreotide, which is a somatostatin analog that reduces portal venous pressure. For long-term management of esophageal varices, non-selective beta blockers such as propranolol or nadolol are recommended to reduce portal venous pressure and prevent rebleeding. Phentolamine and prazosin are alpha blockers, and nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, none of which are indicated in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Nadalol\"}"
