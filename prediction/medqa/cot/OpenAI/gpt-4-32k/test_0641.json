    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has been started on low-dose prednisone, a glucocorticoid, to control her symptoms. Long-term glucocorticoid use is associated with several side effects, one of which is osteoporosis. Osteoporosis, in turn, increases the risk of fractures, particularly in certain areas that are rich in trabecular (spongy) bone, such as the femoral neck. Femoral shaft, proximal phalanx fractures, and Osgood-Schlatter disease are not specifically associated with long-term glucocorticoid use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Femoral neck fracture\"}"
