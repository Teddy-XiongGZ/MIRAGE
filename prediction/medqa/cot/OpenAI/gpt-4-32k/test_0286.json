    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a test that can detect the genetic material of HIV. ELISA and Rapid HIV antibody test are used to detect antibodies, not the genetic material of the virus. Southern blot is a method used in molecular biology for detection of a specific DNA sequence in DNA samples. However, it is not typically used in clinical settings due to its complexity and time-consuming nature. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method widely used in molecular biology to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail. It is used in clinical settings to detect the presence of HIV genetic material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Polymerase chain reaction\"}"
