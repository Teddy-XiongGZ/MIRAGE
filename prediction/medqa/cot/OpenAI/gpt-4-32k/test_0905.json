    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Measurement bias refers to systematic errors that can occur in identifying or measuring the variables of interest in a study. Recall bias is a systematic error caused by differences in the accuracy or completeness of the recollections retrieved by study participants regarding events or experiences from the past. Selection bias is a distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data are collected. Lead-time bias is a type of bias that can occur in survival analysis when the start of the time period being analyzed is defined in a way that systematically shifts it earlier in time. In this case, if the conclusion was due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, it would be an example of lead-time bias, as the detection time is shifted earlier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Lead-time bias\"}"
