    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of chest discomfort, shortness of breath, shakiness, and heavy sweating, which seem to be triggered by stressors such as exams or big school projects, are suggestive of panic attacks. The fact that he is becoming increasingly anxious about having these attacks in public and is therefore leaving the house less often suggests that he may be developing agoraphobia. The first-line treatment for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Citalopram is an SSRI, so it would be the best choice for this patient. Lithium is used for bipolar disorder, propranolol is a beta-blocker used for conditions such as hypertension and heart disease, and quetiapine is an antipsychotic used for conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Citalopram\"}"
