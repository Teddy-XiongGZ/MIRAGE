    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a bias known as lead-time bias. This bias occurs when early detection of a disease (through screening) appears to increase survival time, even if the early detection does not change the course of the disease. In this case, the new screening test can detect the cancer 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms, which could make it seem like patients are living longer, even if their actual time of death doesn't change. To prevent this bias, we should use mortality rates in the analysis, not survival rates. Mortality rates measure the number of deaths in a population over a specific period of time, which is not affected by when the disease was detected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Using mortality rates in the analysis\"}"
