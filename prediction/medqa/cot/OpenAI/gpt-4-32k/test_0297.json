    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue and headache, along with the laboratory findings of hyponatremia (Na+ 130 mEq/L) and high urine osmolality, suggest the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients and can be triggered by a variety of factors, including central nervous system disorders such as subdural hematoma. The high urine osmolality and urine sodium concentration indicate that the kidneys are inappropriately retaining water despite the low serum osmolality. The first-line treatment for SIADH is fluid restriction to decrease water intake and allow the serum sodium to rise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Fluid restriction\"}"
