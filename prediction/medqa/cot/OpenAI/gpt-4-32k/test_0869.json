    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the attributable risk, which is the difference in risk between exposed and unexposed groups. The risk in the exposed group (alcoholics) is 30/200 and in the unexposed group (non-alcoholics) is 30/400. The attributable risk is therefore (30/200) - (30/400). However, the question asks for the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed. This is the population attributable risk, which is the attributable risk times the proportion of the total population that is exposed. The proportion of the total population that is exposed is 30% or 0.3. Therefore, the population attributable risk is ((30/200) - (30/400)) * 0.3. Simplifying this gives 45/195.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
