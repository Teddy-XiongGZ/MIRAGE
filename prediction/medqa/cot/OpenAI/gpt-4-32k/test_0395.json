    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The boy's asthma symptoms are not well controlled, as evidenced by the fact that he is using his albuterol inhaler four times per week and waking up at night due to his symptoms. This indicates that his asthma is not well controlled with his current regimen of a short-acting beta agonist (albuterol) alone. According to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, patients who use their short-acting beta agonist more than twice per week for symptom control (not including use for prevention of exercise-induced symptoms) should be considered for a step up in therapy. The next step in therapy would be the addition of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, such as fluticasone, which is used to reduce inflammation in the airways and prevent asthma attacks. Salmeterol is a long-acting beta agonist and is not typically used as a first-line add-on therapy. Zileuton is a leukotriene modifier and is also not typically used as a first-line add-on therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Add fluticasone daily\"}"
