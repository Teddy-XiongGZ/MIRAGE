    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of back pain, difficulty walking upstairs, and difficulty controlling bowel movements, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, decreased vibratory sense, and a hard nodular mass in the rectum, suggest a spinal cord lesion. The presence of a hard nodular mass in the rectum could indicate a primary malignancy, which could have metastasized to the spine. Syringomyelia typically presents with a cape-like loss of pain and temperature sensation in the upper extremities, which is not seen in this patient. A herniated disc would typically cause radicular pain and would not explain the rectal mass. A spinal hematoma would present acutely with severe back pain and rapidly progressing neurological deficits, which is not consistent with this patient's history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Spinal metastasis\"}"
