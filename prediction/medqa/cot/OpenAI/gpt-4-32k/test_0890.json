    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's T-score of -3.2 SDs indicates osteoporosis, as a T-score of -2.5 or lower is diagnostic for this condition. The patient's risk factors for osteoporosis include her age, gender, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, moderate alcohol use, and family history of fractures. The first-line treatment for osteoporosis is a bisphosphonate, such as alendronate. Calcitonin is a second-line treatment for patients who cannot tolerate bisphosphonates.

Tamoxifen is used for breast cancer prevention and treatment, not for osteoporosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Alendronate\"}"
