    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of intermittent headaches, visual disturbances, and unexpected lactation suggest a pituitary adenoma, specifically a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas are benign tumors of the anterior pituitary gland that overproduce prolactin. The elevated prolactin levels can inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn decreases the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This can lead to decreased levels of sex hormones, including progesterone. Therefore, the most likely associated change in this case would be decreased progesterone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decreased progesterone\"}"
