    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a boy with asthma that worsens with exposure to pollen, suggesting an allergic component to his asthma. The experimental therapy described targets a mediator that promotes class switching of antibodies. Class switching is a mechanism that changes a B cell's production of antibody from one type to another. For example, during an allergic response, the antibody class switches from IgM to IgE. The cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are known to promote this switch to IgE. However, the question specifically mentions that the targeted mediator 'favors the class switching of antibodies', which is a function more specific to IL-4. Therefore, IL-4 is the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. IL-4\"}"
