    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of scrotal pain, dysuria, and urinary frequency suggest a genitourinary infection. The absence of urethral discharge and the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram stain without organisms suggest that the infection is not due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which would typically present with purulent discharge and gram-negative intracellular diplococci. The relief of pain with elevation of the testicle (Prehn's sign) and increased blood flow on ultrasound are indicative of epididymitis. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of acute epididymitis in sexually active men under 35. A testicular tumor would not typically present with these symptoms, and a varicocele would not cause an infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Chlamydia trachomatis infection\"}"
