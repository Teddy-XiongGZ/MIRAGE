    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was involved in a high-impact trauma, which makes spontaneous pneumothorax less likely. The chest radiography showed proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax, which makes inappropriate chest tube placement and tension pneumothorax less likely. The presence of subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area and recurrent pneumothorax despite chest tube placement suggests a tracheobronchial rupture, which is a severe injury that can occur in high-impact trauma and can lead to air leaking into the chest cavity and subcutaneous tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tracheobronchial rupture\"}"
