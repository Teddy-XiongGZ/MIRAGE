Furosemide is a loop diuretic that works in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, not the cortical collecting tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that works in the distal convoluted tubule, not the cortical collecting tubule. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that works in the proximal convoluted tubule, not the cortical collecting tubule. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that works in the cortical collecting tubule by blocking the epithelial sodium channels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Triamterene\"}"
