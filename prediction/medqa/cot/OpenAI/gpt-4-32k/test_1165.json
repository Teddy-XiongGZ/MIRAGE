    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, dyspnea, and cough, along with the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture, suggest a lung infection. The poor weight gain, frequent stools with an unpleasant smell, and the distended abdomen suggest malabsorption. The sweat test showing elevated chloride concentration is a classic sign of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. This gene codes for a protein that regulates the movement of chloride ions across cell membranes, and its malfunction leads to thick, sticky mucus in various organs, including the lungs and pancreas. This can cause recurrent lung infections and malabsorption, as seen in this patient. Therefore, the pathogenesis of this patient's symptoms involves an abnormal CFTR protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Abnormal CFTR protein\"}"
