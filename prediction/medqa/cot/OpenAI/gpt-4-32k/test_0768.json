    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of prostate cancer and recent surgery, and now presents with signs of infection and urinary tract obstruction. A renal biopsy would be invasive and not necessarily helpful in this case. Blood analysis could provide information about infection and kidney function, but it would not directly visualize the obstruction. An abdominal-pelvic CT scan could provide detailed images of the urinary tract and potentially identify the location and cause of the obstruction. However, ultrasound is a non-invasive, readily available, and cost-effective method that can also visualize the urinary tract and identify obstructions. Given the patient's age and condition, it would be the least risky and most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ultrasound\"}"
