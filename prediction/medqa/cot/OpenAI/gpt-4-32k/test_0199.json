    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's recurrent urinary tract infections, bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis, and retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition are indicative of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). This condition is characterized by the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys. Over time, VUR can lead to renal scarring, which would be seen on histologic examination as cortical thinning with tubular atrophy. The other options (glomerular crescents with macrophages, matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation, and thickened glomerular capillary loops) are associated with glomerular diseases, which are not suggested by the patient's clinical presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy\"}"
