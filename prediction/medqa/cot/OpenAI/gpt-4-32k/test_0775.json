    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the anatomy of the area around the L3 vertebra. The inferior vena cava, renal artery, and internal iliac vein are all located in this area. However, the portal vein is located in the upper abdomen, so it would not be affected by a wound at the L3 level. The renal artery is located slightly above the L3 level, so it is less likely to be affected. The internal iliac vein branches off from the inferior vena cava below the L3 level, so it is also less likely to be affected. The inferior vena cava runs vertically up the body and passes by the L3 level, making it the most likely to be injured.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Inferior vena cava\"}"
