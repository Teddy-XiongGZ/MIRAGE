The presence of blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line, thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a complication of severe sepsis. The identification of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain in the patient's blood is characteristic of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.
