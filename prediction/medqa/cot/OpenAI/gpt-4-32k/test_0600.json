    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Capsular polysaccharides are T-independent antigens, which means they can stimulate B cells to produce antibodies without the help of T cells. However, this type of immune response is not very effective in infants and young children because their immune system is not fully developed. By conjugating the polysaccharides to a protein carrier, the immune response becomes T-dependent, which is more effective and can provide protection to infants and young children. Therefore, the answer is not A or B because the type of antibody response is not the main reason for conjugation. The answer is also not C because the stability of the vaccine is not the primary reason for conjugation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
