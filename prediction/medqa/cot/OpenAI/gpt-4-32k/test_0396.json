    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of weight loss despite increased appetite, chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance are suggestive of hyperthyroidism. However, her physical exam of the thyroid is unremarkable, which suggests that the source of excess thyroid hormone is not the thyroid gland itself. The low TSH level indicates that the pituitary gland is not stimulating the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones, which further supports the idea that the source of the excess thyroid hormone is not the thyroid gland. The finding of a complex structure in her right ovary on ultrasound suggests an ovarian tumor. Struma ovarii is a type of ovarian tumor that can produce thyroid hormones, which would explain the patient's symptoms and lab findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Struma ovarii\"}"
