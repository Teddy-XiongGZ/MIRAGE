    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's age, the rapid growth of the mass, and the mammographic findings of a smooth polylobulated mass are all suggestive of a phyllodes tumor. Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial neoplasms that can grow rapidly and present as large, painless masses. They are characterized histologically by the presence of epithelial and stromal components, with the stromal component showing varying degrees of hypercellularity and atypia, as seen in this patient. Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors in women under 30 and typically do not grow rapidly. Fibrocystic disease of the breast is characterized by cyclic breast pain, nodularity, and cysts, none of which are present in this patient. Invasive lobular carcinoma typically presents as a poorly defined mass or architectural distortion on mammography, not a smooth polylobulated mass.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Phyllodes tumor\"}"
