    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion and the physical examination findings of an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex on auscultation, along with an S3 heart sound and bounding pulses, are indicative of aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation is characterized by a diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best along the left sternal border due to the backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. The bounding pulses (Corrigan's pulse) are also a classic sign of aortic regurgitation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Aortic regurgitation\"}"
