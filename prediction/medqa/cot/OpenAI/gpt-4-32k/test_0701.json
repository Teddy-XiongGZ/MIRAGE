This is a genetic disorder that often presents with hypotonia (limpness) at birth, followed by hyperphagia (excessive eating) leading to obesity, intellectual disability, and hypogonadism. The hyperphagia is thought to be due to abnormalities in the hypothalamic regulation of appetite, with increased levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin. Ghrelin is produced primarily in the stomach by P/D1 cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. P/D1 cells\"}"
