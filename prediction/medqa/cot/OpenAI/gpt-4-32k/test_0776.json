    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The number needed to treat (NNT) is a measure that indicates how many patients need to be treated with a particular therapy to prevent one additional bad outcome. It is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). ARR is the difference in the outcomes of the control group and the treatment group. In this case, the cure rate in the treatment group is 190/250 = 0.76, and in the control group is 165/250 = 0.66. So, ARR = 0.76 - 0.66 = 0.1. Therefore, NNT = 1/ARR = 1/0.1 = 10. None of the provided options match this calculation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
