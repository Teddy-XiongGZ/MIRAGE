    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of painful enlarging bruises, skin ulceration, and areas of skin necrosis, especially after starting treatment with warfarin, are indicative of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. This condition is a rare complication of warfarin therapy, typically occurring within the first few days of treatment. It is thought to be due to a rapid decrease in protein C levels, which is a natural anticoagulant. The relative deficiency of protein C compared to the other coagulation factors can lead to a hypercoagulable state, resulting in thrombosis of the small and medium-sized vessels of the dermis and subsequent skin necrosis. Therefore, the best treatment option would be to replenish the protein C levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Protein C concentrate\"}"
