    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had unprotected intercourse the previous day and does not wish to become pregnant. She needs emergency contraception. Mifepristone is not used for emergency contraception. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is a long-term contraceptive method and not suitable for emergency contraception. Between a copper IUD and ulipristal acetate, the latter is a pill and does not require a procedure for administration. However, the patient has a metal allergy, and while it's not specified if copper is one of them, it's safer to avoid the copper IUD. Therefore, ulipristal acetate, which is a progesterone receptor modulator and can be used as an emergency contraceptive up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse, is the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
