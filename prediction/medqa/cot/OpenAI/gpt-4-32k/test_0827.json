    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and visual field defects suggest a pituitary adenoma, specifically a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas can cause amenorrhea by inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn reduces the levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, leading to a decrease in estrogen production and cessation of menses. Intrauterine scar tissue accumulation, nondisjunction of chromosomes, and nutritional imbalance do not fit with the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release\"}"
