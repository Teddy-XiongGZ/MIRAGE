    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of back pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs that improve with forward flexion (eg, riding a bike, pushing a cart) and worsen with walking are suggestive of neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal that compresses the cauda equina nerve roots. It is most commonly due to degenerative changes (eg, osteoarthritis, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy) in patients >60 years of age. The patient's age, history of osteoporosis, and smoking history further support this diagnosis. A compression fracture would typically present with acute back pain following a trauma or minor fall, especially in a patient with osteoporosis, but this patient's pain is chronic and non-tender on examination. A herniated nucleus pulposus would typically cause radicular pain, not claudication. Musculoskeletal strain would not typically cause the numbness and weakness in the legs that this patient is experiencing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Spinal stenosis\"}"
