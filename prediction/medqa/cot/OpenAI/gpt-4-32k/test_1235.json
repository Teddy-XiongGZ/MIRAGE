    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The disease described in the question is cystic fibrosis, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that both parents must carry a copy of the defective gene for a child to be affected. The woman is affected, so she carries two copies of the defective gene. Her husband comes from a population where the prevalence of the disease is 1/100, so the carrier frequency is approximately 1/10 (since the carrier frequency is roughly twice the square root of the disease prevalence for autosomal recessive diseases). Therefore, the chance that the husband is a carrier is 1/10. If he is a carrier, there is a 1/2 chance that he will pass on the defective gene to their child. So, the overall chance that their child will have the disease is 1/10 (chance that the husband is a carrier) * 1/2 (chance that he passes on the defective gene) = 1/20.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
