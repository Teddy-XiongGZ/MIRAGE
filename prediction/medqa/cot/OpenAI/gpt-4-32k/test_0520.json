    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ATP2A1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the calcium ATPase pump, which is responsible for moving calcium ions out of the cytosol and into the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. This process is crucial for muscle relaxation. If there is a mutation in this gene, the pump will not function properly, leading to an accumulation of calcium ions in the cytosol. This would increase the concentration of cytosolic calcium. Additionally, the inability to properly remove calcium ions from the cytosol would delay muscle relaxation, leading to an increased muscle relaxation time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased\"}"
