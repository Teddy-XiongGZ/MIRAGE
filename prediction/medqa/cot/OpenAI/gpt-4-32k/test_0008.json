    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The copper IUD is a non-hormonal form of birth control, so it does not increase the risk of stroke, venous thromboembolism, or breast cancer, which are associated with hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, a history of these conditions would not contraindicate its use. A known liver neoplasm also would not contraindicate the use of a copper IUD. However, active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease is a contraindication for IUD placement because the device could potentially facilitate the spread of infection into the upper genital tract.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\"}"
