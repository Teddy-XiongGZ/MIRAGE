    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient has a very low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, which puts him at risk for opportunistic infections. The most common opportunistic infections in patients with CD4+ counts <50/mm3 are Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. Prophylaxis for PCP is recommended for patients with CD4+ counts <200/mm3 and can be achieved with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Prophylaxis for MAC is recommended for patients with CD4+ counts <50/mm3 and can be achieved with azithromycin. CMV retinitis is less common and usually occurs in patients with CD4+ counts <50/mm3 who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Prophylaxis is not typically recommended unless the patient has a history of CMV retinitis. Therefore, the most appropriate medication regimen for this patient at this time would be one that includes both trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin\"}"
