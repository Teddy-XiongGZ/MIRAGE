    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely due to his long history of smoking. In COPD, there is an obstruction of the airways which leads to difficulty in expelling air from the lungs. This results in an increased residual volume, which is the amount of air left in the lungs after a forced expiration. The 1 second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) is also typically decreased in COPD due to the obstruction of the airways.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume\"}"
