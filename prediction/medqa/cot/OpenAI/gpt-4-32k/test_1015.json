    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms of irritability, occasional cyanosis (turning blue), and the position she assumes (knees drawn to her chest) are indicative of a congenital heart defect. This position, known as the 'Tet spell' position, is often assumed by children with Tetralogy of Fallot to relieve cyanotic episodes. The harsh, systolic ejection murmur heard at the upper left sternal border is also consistent with this diagnosis. Transposition of the great vessels typically presents immediately after birth with cyanosis but without heart murmur. Pulmonary hypoplasia would not typically present with a heart murmur. An atrial septal defect usually presents with a softer, systolic ejection murmur and is not typically associated with cyanosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Tetralogy of Fallot\"}"
