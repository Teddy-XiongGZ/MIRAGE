    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's recurrent bacterial infections, light-colored skin, silver-colored hair, and large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils are all indicative of an immunodeficiency disorder. The mutation in the LYST gene is a key clue. This gene is associated with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism (light-colored skin and silver-colored hair), recurrent pyogenic infections, and abnormal neutrophil function (large cytoplasmic vacuoles). The other options do not fit with the clinical picture and genetic findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Chediak-Higashi syndrome\"}"
