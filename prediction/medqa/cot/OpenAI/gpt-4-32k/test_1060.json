    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn's symptoms of fever, yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae (jaundice), loss of flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis, along with the lab findings of decreased haptoglobin and increased LDH levels, suggest hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). HDN is caused by maternal antibodies against fetal red blood cells. The mother is Rh+, so she wouldn't have antibodies against the rhesus D antigen. The other options (decrease in the reduced form of glutathione, deficiency of ATP, and osmotically fragile erythrocytes) are associated with other types of hemolytic anemia, not HDN.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen\"}"
