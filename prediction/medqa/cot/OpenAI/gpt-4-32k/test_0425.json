    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, it's important to consider the ethical principles involved in this situation. The principle of autonomy is crucial in medical decision-making, meaning that patients have the right to make decisions about their own healthcare. In this case, the patient is not able to understand the implications of sexual intercourse and pregnancy, which makes it difficult for her to make an informed decision about a tubal ligation. However, it's also important to consider the principle of beneficence, which involves doing what is best for the patient. In this case, the mother is concerned about the potential for her daughter to become pregnant and not be able to care for a child. However, scheduling the surgery without the patient's understanding or consent would violate her autonomy. Waiting until the patient is 18 years old doesn't necessarily solve the problem, as the patient's mental capacity may not change with age. Refusing the procedure because it's unlikely the patient will get pregnant doesn't address the mother's concerns. Therefore, the best option seems to be to refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
