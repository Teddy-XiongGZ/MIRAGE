    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of headache, nausea, agitation, confusion, and unsteady gait, along with the history of being in a lakeside cabin with a fire, suggest carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with a much higher affinity than oxygen, reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and leading to hypoxia. Pulse oximetry can be falsely normal in carbon monoxide poisoning because it cannot differentiate between carboxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin. The most effective treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is 100% oxygen therapy, which helps to displace the carbon monoxide from hemoglobin. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy could be considered in severe cases, but it is not as readily available as 100% oxygen therapy. Intravenous nitroprusside and heliox therapy are not appropriate treatments for this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 100% oxygen therapy\"}"
