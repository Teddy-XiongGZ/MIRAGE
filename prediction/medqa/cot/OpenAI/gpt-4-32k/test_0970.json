    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, racing thoughts, heart palpitations, dizziness, and muscle tension are indicative of an anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines like Diazepam and Alprazolam are often used to treat anxiety, but they have a high potential for abuse and dependence, especially in patients with a history of substance abuse like this patient. Ramelteon is a sleep aid, which doesn't directly address the patient's primary symptoms. Buspirone, on the other hand, is an anxiolytic that doesn't carry the same risk of dependence and is therefore a safer choice for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Buspirone\"}"
