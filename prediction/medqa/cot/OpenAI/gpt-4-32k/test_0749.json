    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of a severe headache, jaw pain that worsens with chewing, and scalp and temporal tenderness are suggestive of temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis. This is a medical emergency that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. The best next step in management would be to start treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, even before a temporal artery biopsy is performed to confirm the diagnosis. A CT head would not be the best next step as it may not show the inflammation of the arteries. Ibuprofen would not be sufficient to treat this condition. A lumbar puncture would not be indicated as the symptoms do not suggest a central nervous system infection or bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. IV steroids\"}"
