    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total amount of drug needed per day to maintain the target plasma concentration. This can be done by multiplying the plasma clearance by the target plasma concentration, which gives us 15.0 L/h * 2 mg/L = 30 mg/h. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we need 30 mg/h * 24 h/day = 720 mg/day. However, since the oral bioavailability of the drug is 75%, we need to adjust the dose to account for this. The adjusted dose is 720 mg/day / 0.75 = 960 mg/day. Since the drug is administered twice per day, the dose per administration is 960 mg/day / 2 = 480 mg per dose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 480 mg\"}"
