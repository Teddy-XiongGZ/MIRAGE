    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malaria prophylaxis is important for travelers to endemic areas, especially for pregnant women who are at higher risk of severe disease. The choice of prophylaxis depends on the resistance pattern of Plasmodium species in the area of travel. Ethiopia has a high prevalence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, so chloroquine would not be a suitable choice. Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of maternal hepatotoxicity and discoloration of the infant's teeth. Proguanil is not used for prophylaxis in the United States. Mefloquine is safe in all trimesters of pregnancy and is effective against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum, making it the best choice in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mefloquine\"}"
