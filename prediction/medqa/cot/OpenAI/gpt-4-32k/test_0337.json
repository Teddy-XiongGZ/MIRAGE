    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient's history and physical examination findings are suggestive of an atrial septal defect (ASD), a congenital heart defect characterized by a hole in the septum between the atria. The fixed splitting of S2 and the midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border are classic findings in ASD. During pregnancy, there are several physiological changes that occur, including an increase in blood volume, cardiac output, and heart rate, and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. However, the patient's symptoms of dizziness and dyspnea on exertion, which have worsened during pregnancy, are likely due to the increase in blood volume. This is because the increase in blood volume during pregnancy can exacerbate the left-to-right shunt in ASD, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow and subsequent symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increase in blood volume\"}"
