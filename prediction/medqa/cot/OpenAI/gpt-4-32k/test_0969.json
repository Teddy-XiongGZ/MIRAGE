    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of a painful, swollen, and purulent ulcer on the labia majora, along with painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, are suggestive of a sexually transmitted infection. Klebsiella granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale, which typically presents with painless ulcers, so it's not likely the cause. Herpes simplex virus type 2 causes painful vesicles that can ulcerate, but these are usually not purulent. Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, which presents with a painless chancre and non-tender lymphadenopathy. Haemophilus ducreyi, on the other hand, causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful, purulent ulcers and painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, which matches the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Haemophilus ducreyi\"}"
