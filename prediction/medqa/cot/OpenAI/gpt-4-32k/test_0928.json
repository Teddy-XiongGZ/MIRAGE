    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. Initial management includes removal of the allergen if possible, airway management, and administration of intramuscular epinephrine. However, this patient's blood pressure remains low despite these interventions, indicating that he is in anaphylactic shock. In patients with anaphylaxis who do not respond to initial treatment, vasopressors should be administered. The patient's history of taking labetalol, a non-selective beta blocker, is important because it can block the beta-adrenergic effects of epinephrine, reducing its effectiveness. Glucagon can be used in these cases because it bypasses the beta-adrenergic receptor and increases intracellular cyclic AMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and increased cardiac inotropy and chronotropy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Administer glucagon\"}"
