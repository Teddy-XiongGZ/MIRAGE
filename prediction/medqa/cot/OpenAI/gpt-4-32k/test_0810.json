    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's lab results show a normal hemoglobin level, MCV, and platelet count. However, the MCHC is elevated, and there are spherocytes present in the peripheral blood smear. Spherocytes are indicative of a type of hemolytic anemia, and the negative Coombs test suggests that this is not immune-mediated. The presence of scleral icterus and splenomegaly further supports a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. The most common non-immune hemolytic anemia is hereditary spherocytosis, which is a defect in the red blood cell membrane proteins. The Eosin-5-maleimide binding test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis, as it detects the decreased membrane surface area that is characteristic of this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Eosin-5-maleimide binding test\"}"
