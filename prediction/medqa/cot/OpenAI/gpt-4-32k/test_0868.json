    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness, along with his slow response to questions, suggest that he may be experiencing some form of cardiovascular compromise. His pulse is low and his blood pressure is also on the lower side, which further supports this idea. The ECG findings indicate that he has a type of heart block, specifically a Mobitz type II second-degree heart block, as evidenced by the constant PR interval with every third P wave that is nonconducted. This type of heart block can progress to complete heart block, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to address this heart block. Dobutamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are all medications that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, but they do not directly address the underlying issue of the heart block. Cardiac pacing, on the other hand, can directly address the heart block by providing a reliable and regular heartbeat.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Cardiac pacing\"}"
