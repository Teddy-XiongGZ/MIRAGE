    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been given magnesium sulfate, which is often used as a prophylactic treatment for seizures in patients with preeclampsia or eclampsia. One of the side effects of magnesium sulfate is a decrease in deep tendon reflexes, which is a sign of magnesium toxicity. The appropriate management for magnesium toxicity is to stop the magnesium sulfate and administer calcium gluconate, which acts as an antagonist to the effects of magnesium. Labetalol is a blood pressure medication and is not related to the patient's current symptoms. Lorazepam is a sedative and would not address the underlying issue of magnesium toxicity. Nerve conduction studies would not be appropriate in this situation as the cause of the absent deep tendon reflexes is likely due to the magnesium sulfate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Stop magnesium sulfate and give calcium gluconate\"}"
