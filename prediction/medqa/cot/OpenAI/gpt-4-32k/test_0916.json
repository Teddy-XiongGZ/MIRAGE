    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and alcohol use predispose him to coronary artery disease. The sudden onset of substernal chest pain is suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. However, the rapid resolution of his symptoms and ECG changes within 15 minutes is not typical for a myocardial infarction, which is usually caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture and takes hours to resolve. This rapid resolution of symptoms and ECG changes is more suggestive of a transient and reversible cause, such as coronary artery vasospasm. Coronary artery vasospasm, or Prinzmetal angina, can cause transient ST-segment elevations on ECG, which resolve after the spasm subsides. Coronary artery vasodilation would not cause chest pain and ST-segment elevations. Pericardial inflammation would not cause transient ST-segment elevations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Coronary artery vasospasm\"}"
