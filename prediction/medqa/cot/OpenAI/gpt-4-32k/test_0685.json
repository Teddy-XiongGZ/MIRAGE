    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the dotted line on a graph of lung volume versus transpulmonary pressure. This line typically represents the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal exhalation, which is the functional residual capacity. Inspiratory capacity is the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal exhalation, which would be represented by a line at a higher volume. Tidal volume is the amount of air inhaled or exhaled during normal breathing, which would be represented by a line at a lower volume. Total lung capacity is the maximum amount of air the lungs can hold, which would be represented by a line at the highest volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Functional residual capacity\"}"
