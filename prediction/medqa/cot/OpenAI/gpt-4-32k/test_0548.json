    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and the increase in CD4+ T cell count suggest an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is a paradoxical worsening of pre-existing infectious disease symptoms after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV patients. This is due to the recovery of the immune system and its response to persisting infectious antigens. The most appropriate initial step in the management of IRIS is to continue both antiretroviral therapy and anti-infective treatment. Stopping antiretroviral therapy would lead to a decrease in CD4+ T cell count and worsening of the patient's HIV status. Changing the antitubercular therapy is not necessary as the patient's sputum smear is negative, indicating that the current regimen is effective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change\"}"
