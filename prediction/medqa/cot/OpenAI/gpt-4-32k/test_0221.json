    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mother of the newborn has HIV and despite receiving antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, her viral load was not undetectable prior to delivery. This means that there is a risk of vertical transmission of HIV to the newborn. The first step in managing such a newborn is to reduce the risk of transmission by administering antiretroviral prophylaxis, in this case, zidovudine. HIV DNA or RNA testing is not the immediate next step, as these tests are used to confirm infection, not prevent it. Reassurance and follow-up is also not the immediate next step, as the newborn is at risk and needs prophylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Administer zidovudine\"}"
