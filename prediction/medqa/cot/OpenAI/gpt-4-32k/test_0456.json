    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant's presentation is suggestive of jaundice, which is common in newborns. The mother's report of poor breastfeeding and the lactation consultant's observation of a poor latch suggest that the infant is not getting enough breast milk. This can lead to dehydration and increased bilirubin levels, causing jaundice. This is known as breastfeeding jaundice, which typically presents in the first week of life. Breast milk jaundice, on the other hand, typically presents after the first week of life and is due to substances in the breast milk that inhibit the conjugation of bilirubin. Sepsis and physiologic hyperbilirubinemia are less likely given the infant's presentation and history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Breastfeeding jaundice\"}"
