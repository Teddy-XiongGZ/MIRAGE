    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea, along with eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens, suggest that he is suffering from asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is often associated with allergic reactions. The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Beta-2 antagonists would actually worsen bronchoconstriction, so they are not a good choice. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are used in cancer treatment and have no role in asthma management. Anticoagulants are used to prevent blood clots and are not relevant here. Muscarinic antagonists, on the other hand, are bronchodilators that can help to relieve the bronchoconstriction seen in asthma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Muscarinic antagonist\"}"
