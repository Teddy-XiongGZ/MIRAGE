    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible acute coronary syndrome, but the ECG findings and vital signs are not provided, so we can't confirm this. However, the patient's rapid and irregular pulse, along with his low blood pressure, suggest a possible arrhythmia. The most appropriate next step would be to stabilize the patient's heart rate and rhythm. Intravenous amiodarone and esmolol are both used to control heart rate in arrhythmias, but esmolol is a short-acting beta blocker that can lower blood pressure, which is already low in this patient. Amiodarone is a better choice because it can control both rate and rhythm without significantly lowering blood pressure. Synchronized cardioversion is usually reserved for patients who are hemodynamically unstable despite medication, or for those with life-threatening arrhythmias. A coronary angiogram would be useful for diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it's not the immediate priority in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Intravenous amiodarone\"}"
