    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that affects the shape and function of red blood cells. The disease is characterized by the production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S (HgbS). Hydroxyurea is a medication often used in the treatment of this condition. It does not decrease the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin, nor does it decrease the levels of HgbS or HgbF. Instead, hydroxyurea works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF), which is a type of hemoglobin that is resistant to sickling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)\"}"
