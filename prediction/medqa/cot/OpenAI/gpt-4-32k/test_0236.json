    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms of severe sunburns despite sunscreen use, along with irritated and erythematous corneas, suggest a condition called xeroderma pigmentosum. This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. The condition occurs due to defects in DNA repair mechanisms, specifically in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. This pathway is responsible for repairing UV-induced DNA damage. The other options listed, non-homologous end joining, homologous recombination, and mismatch repair, are also DNA repair mechanisms, but they are not specifically involved in repairing UV-induced DNA damage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Nucleotide excision repair\"}"
