Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon that is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is typically associated with E. coli infection, which is not indicated here.

Pancreatic cancer is not typically associated with ulcerative colitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Colorectal cancer\"}"
