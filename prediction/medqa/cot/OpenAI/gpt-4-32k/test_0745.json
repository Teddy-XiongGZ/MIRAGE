    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of lightheadedness after hemodialysis and the drop in blood pressure suggest intradialytic hypotension, a common complication of hemodialysis. This can be due to factors such as excessive ultrafiltration and rapid changes in blood volume. Cooling the dialysate is a known method to reduce the risk of intradialytic hypotension. It works by reducing vasodilation, which is a common cause of hypotension during dialysis. Eating heavier meals during dialysis, increasing ultrafiltration, and steroid administration are not standard methods to prevent intradialytic hypotension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cooling the dialysate\"}"
