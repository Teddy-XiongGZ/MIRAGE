    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision and is now presenting with chest pain, sinus tachycardia, and bruising over his chest wall. These are all signs of a traumatic injury. The elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins are indicative of cardiac damage. Hemorrhage would likely present with hypotension and tachycardia, but the patient's blood pressure is relatively stable. Pulmonary contusion would likely present with respiratory symptoms, which the patient does not have. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, but there's no indication of that in the patient's history. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac contusion, which is a bruise of the heart muscle caused by blunt chest trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cardiac contusion\"}"
