    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of recurrent episodes of facial swelling and abdominal pain following trauma or stress, along with the absence of pruritus, suggests hereditary angioedema. This condition is characterized by a deficiency of C1 inhibitor, a protein that normally inhibits the classical complement pathway and the production of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. When C1 inhibitor is deficient, unchecked bradykinin production leads to increased vascular permeability and angioedema. The condition is not associated with autoantibody-mediated tissue damage, drug-induced bradykinin excess, or mast-cell activation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Complement inhibitor deficiency\"}"
