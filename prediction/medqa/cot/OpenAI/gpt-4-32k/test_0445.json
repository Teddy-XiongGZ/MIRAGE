    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of unilateral leg swelling without pain or erythema, recent surgery, and cancer diagnosis all point towards a high probability of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The most appropriate next step in management would be to confirm this diagnosis. CT pulmonary angiography is used to diagnose pulmonary embolism, not DVT. D-dimer level can be used as a screening test for DVT, but it has a high false-positive rate and is not as specific as imaging. Blood cultures would be appropriate if there was a suspicion of sepsis, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest this. Compression ultrasonography is the first-line imaging modality for suspected DVT and would be the most appropriate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Compression ultrasonography\"}"
