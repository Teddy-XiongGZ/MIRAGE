    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of irregular menses, hirsutism, acne, and elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone suggest a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. The hyperandrogenism is due to the hyperproliferation of theca interna cells, which produce androgens. This is not consistent with exogenous anabolic steroid use, which would not cause irregular menses. Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles are a feature of PCOS, but they are a result of the underlying hormonal imbalance, not the cause. Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex would cause elevated cortisol levels, which are not seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells\"}"
