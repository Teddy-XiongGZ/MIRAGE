    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epinephrine is a catecholamine that acts on both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Its effects include bronchodilation, increased heart rate, and decreased motility of the gastrointestinal tract. However, this patient is on propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, which blocks the beta adrenergic receptors. Therefore, the effect of epinephrine on the heart rate would be blocked, leading to no increase in heart rate. The other options are not correct because epinephrine does not decrease bronchodilation or heart rate, and it decreases, not increases, gastrointestinal motility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Decreased heart rate\"}"
