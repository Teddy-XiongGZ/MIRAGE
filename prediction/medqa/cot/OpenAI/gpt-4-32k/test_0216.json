    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of bilateral flank pain, reddish urine, and costovertebral tenderness to percussion bilaterally suggest a renal origin of her symptoms. The absence of casts or dysmorphic RBCs in the urine rules out glomerular diseases, such as those caused by necrotizing inflammation of the renal glomeruli. The low WBC count in the urine makes bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma unlikely. The patient's history of chronic aspirin use is significant, as aspirin can cause analgesic nephropathy, which is characterized by chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis and papillary necrosis. This condition can lead to vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels, resulting in ischemia and sloughing of the renal papillae, which can cause hematuria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels\"}"
