    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of hyperthermia, autonomic dysregulation (evidenced by hypertension and tachycardia), altered mental status, and generalized muscle rigidity, especially after administration of haloperidol, a dopamine antagonist, is suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. Although heat stroke could also present with hyperthermia and altered mental status, the presence of generalized muscle rigidity is more characteristic of NMS. Catatonic schizophrenia could explain the rigidity and altered mental status, but it would not typically cause hyperthermia or autonomic dysregulation. Oversedation could cause somnolence and non-responsiveness, but it would not typically cause hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, or rigidity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\"}"
