    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of intravenous drug use, fever, and new murmur are suggestive of infective endocarditis. The presence of retinal hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth spots) and multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve seen on transthoracic echocardiography further support this diagnosis. The tricuspid valve is most commonly involved in right-sided infective endocarditis, which is often seen in intravenous drug users. The most appropriate next step in management is to start empiric antibiotic therapy while awaiting blood culture results. Vancomycin is a good choice because it covers methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of right-sided infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Intravenous vancomycin therapy\"}"
