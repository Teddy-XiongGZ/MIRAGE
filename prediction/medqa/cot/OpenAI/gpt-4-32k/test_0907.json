    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of retrosternal pain that occurs with exertion or cold weather, along with shortness of breath and palpitations, are suggestive of angina pectoris. This is a condition caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, often due to coronary artery disease. Despite the ECG and cardiac markers being normal, these tests can be normal in stable angina. The next step in diagnosis would be to perform a stress test to evaluate the heart's response to exertion. However, because the patient has a physical disability that prevents her from performing an exercise stress test, a pharmacological stress test should be performed instead. This involves using medication to simulate the effects of exercise on the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress\"}"
