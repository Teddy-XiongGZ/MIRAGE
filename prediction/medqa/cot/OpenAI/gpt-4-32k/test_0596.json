    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn boy was initially tachypneic and had elevated pulmonary artery pressure, which improved with a medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP. This suggests that he had pulmonary hypertension, which can be seen in meconium aspiration syndrome. However, he later developed cyanosis, which is a sign of hypoxia. The most likely cause of this is a right-to-left shunt due to closure of the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus normally closes after birth, but in cases of pulmonary hypertension, it may remain open to allow blood to bypass the high-pressure pulmonary circulation. If it closes, blood is forced into the high-pressure pulmonary circulation, leading to hypoxia and cyanosis. The other options are less likely: Increase in concentration of serum myoglobin is associated with muscle damage, not cyanosis. Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+ can cause methemoglobinemia, which can lead to cyanosis, but there is no indication that this has occurred. Allosteric alteration of heme groups can affect oxygen binding, but this is not typically a cause of cyanosis in newborns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Closure of the ductus arteriosus\"}"
