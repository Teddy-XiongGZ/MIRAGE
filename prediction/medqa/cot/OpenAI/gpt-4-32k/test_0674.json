    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a drug that increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation. Incretins are hormones that stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin is a drug that inhibits the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which is responsible for the degradation of incretins. Therefore, Sitagliptin increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation, which is the same mechanism of action described in the question. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin release from the pancreas. Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that reduces renal glucose reabsorption. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Sitagliptin\"}"
