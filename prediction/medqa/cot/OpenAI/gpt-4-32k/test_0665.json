    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a ganglion cyst, which is a benign, fluid-filled mass that commonly occurs near the wrist joint. The transillumination, rubbery consistency, and non-tenderness are characteristic features of a ganglion cyst. The tingling pain and decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger suggest that the median nerve, which provides sensation to these areas, is being affected. The median nerve runs adjacent to the flexor carpi radialis tendon, so this tendon is at risk of entrapment if the mass persists.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\"}"
