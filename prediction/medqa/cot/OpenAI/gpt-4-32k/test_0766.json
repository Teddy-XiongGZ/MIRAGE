    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a healthy 16-year-old female who has not had a menstrual period. She has normal female external genitalia, pubic hair, and breasts, which suggests that she has normal female secondary sexual characteristics. This rules out conditions related to abnormal sexual development such as androgen receptor mutation or absence of second X chromosome. A pituitary tumor would likely present with other symptoms and wouldn't explain the absence of the uterus. The absence of the uterus on ultrasound, despite normal external female genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics, suggests a problem with the development of the internal female reproductive structures. The paramesonephric (M\u00fcllerian) ducts are responsible for the development of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper part of the vagina in females. Therefore, a failure of paramesonephric duct development is the most likely cause of this patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Failure of paramesonephric duct development\"}"
