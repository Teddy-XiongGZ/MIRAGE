    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is often used to treat hypertriglyceridemia. One of the common side effects of niacin is flushing, which is caused by the release of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin D2, from the skin's Langerhans cells. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins. Therefore, taking aspirin before niacin can help reduce the flushing side effect by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Release of prostaglandins\"}"
