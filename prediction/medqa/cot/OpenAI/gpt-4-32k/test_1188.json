    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"T cell development is a complex process that occurs in the thymus. The process begins with a progenitor cell from the bone marrow, which becomes a pre-T cell. The pre-T cell then becomes a double-positive T cell, expressing both CD4 and CD8. It is during this double-positive stage that positive selection occurs. Positive selection ensures that T cells can recognize and bind to self-MHC molecules. After positive selection, T cells become either single-positive CD4+ or CD8+ T cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
