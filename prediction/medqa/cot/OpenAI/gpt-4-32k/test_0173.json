    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metyrapone is a drug used to test the function of the adrenal gland. It works by blocking the last step of cortisol synthesis in the adrenal gland, which is the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. When this step is blocked, the adrenal gland cannot produce cortisol. This leads to an increase in ACTH secretion by the pituitary gland, as the body tries to stimulate more cortisol production. Therefore, after administration of metyrapone, we would expect to see an increase in serum ACTH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Increase in serum ACTH\"}"
