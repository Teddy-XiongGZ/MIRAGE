    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of lethargy and irritability between meals, along with the finding of normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin, suggest a hemolytic anemia. The fact that the mother's brother occasionally requires blood transfusions suggests a hereditary condition. The negative Coombs test rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The normal red blood cell osmotic fragility gap rules out hereditary spherocytosis. The physician's determination that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency points towards a condition like pyruvate kinase deficiency, which is a common cause of hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway that is allosterically inhibited by alanine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Alanine\"}"
