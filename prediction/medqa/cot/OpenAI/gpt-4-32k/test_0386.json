    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of increased menstrual bleeding, easy bruising, bleeding gums, and physical findings of petechiae and ecchymoses suggest a bleeding disorder. The lab results show a low platelet count, which could be the cause of her symptoms. However, the PT and aPTT are normal, which rules out coagulation factor deficiencies and liver disease. The peripheral blood smear shows no morphologic abnormalities, which rules out conditions like immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) where platelets are destroyed by antibodies. The patient's sexual history suggests a risk for sexually transmitted infections, but there's no history of intravenous drug use, which is a common risk factor for blood-borne viruses like HIV and HCV. Therefore, the next best step would be to rule out conditions that can cause thrombocytopenia due to decreased production or increased destruction of platelets. Among the options, HIV and HCV testing (choice C) would be the most appropriate next step, as these infections can cause thrombocytopenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
