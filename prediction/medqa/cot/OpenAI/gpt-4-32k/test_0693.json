    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Prinzmetal's angina, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of chest pain that often occur at rest, without any identifiable triggers. This condition is caused by coronary artery spasm, which can occur at any time but is most common during periods of rest or minimal activity, such as during sleep or while sitting at a desk. The pain typically lasts for a short period of time and resolves spontaneously. Aspirin and heparin are antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, respectively, and are typically used in the treatment of conditions associated with thrombosis, such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina, which is not the case here. Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate, which can help to relax and widen blood vessels, thereby improving blood flow to the heart muscle. However, calcium channel blockers are the first-line treatment for Prinzmetal's angina. Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which can reduce heart rate and blood pressure, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for Prinzmetal's angina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Isosorbide dinitrate\"}"
