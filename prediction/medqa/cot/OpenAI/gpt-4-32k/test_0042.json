    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of bilious vomiting and failure to pass meconium within the first 24-48 hours of life is suggestive of a distal intestinal obstruction. Duodenal atresia would typically present with non-bilious vomiting, as it is a proximal obstruction. Pyloric stenosis typically presents after the first few weeks of life with non-bilious, projectile vomiting. Necrotizing enterocolitis is more common in premature infants and typically presents with bloody stools, abdominal distension, and signs of sepsis, which are not present in this case. Meconium ileus, on the other hand, is a common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction and is often the presenting sign of cystic fibrosis. It presents with bilious vomiting and failure to pass meconium, which matches this patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Meconium ileus\"}"
