    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of syncope and exercise intolerance, along with the physical examination findings of a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border and a double pulse during systole (known as a bifid pulse), are suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is characterized by hypertrophy of the interventricular septum that can obstruct the left ventricular outflow tract, especially during maneuvers that decrease left ventricular volume, such as the Valsalva maneuver or standing up. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and symptoms of syncope and exercise intolerance. The murmur of HCM is unique in that it increases with maneuvers that decrease left ventricular volume (such as the Valsalva maneuver or standing up) and decreases with maneuvers that increase left ventricular volume (such as squatting or lying down). The bifid pulse is due to the dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, which causes a rapid ejection of blood followed by a less forceful ejection as the obstruction worsens during systole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\"}"
