    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Brain death is a clinical diagnosis that is based on the absence of all cerebral and brainstem activity. The patient in the question is unresponsive, with dilated and non-reactive pupils, which suggests a severe brain injury. However, to confirm brain death, we need to establish the absence of all brainstem reflexes.

Therefore, the corneal reflex test is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Corneal reflex test\"}"
