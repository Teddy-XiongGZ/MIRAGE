    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation includes multiple signs of bleeding and coagulation abnormalities, such as oozing from IV sites, a laceration that continues to bleed despite pressure, and petechiae and purpura. The lab results also show a low platelet count and prolonged PT and aPTT, which are indicative of a coagulation disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by systemic activation of blood coagulation, which results in widespread fibrin deposition in the circulation. It can be triggered by several conditions, including trauma. The other options, such as air embolization and tension pneumothorax, do not explain the coagulation abnormalities and bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation\"}"
