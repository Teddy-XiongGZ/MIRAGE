This is further supported by the fact that he was found in a field, where such substances are commonly used. The initial management of a cholinergic crisis involves securing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Intubation may be necessary to protect the airway if the patient's mental status is significantly altered or if there is a risk of aspiration due to excessive secretions. Neostigmine, physostigmine, and 2-pralidoxime are all antidotes for cholinergic poisoning, but they would not be the first step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Intubation\"}"
