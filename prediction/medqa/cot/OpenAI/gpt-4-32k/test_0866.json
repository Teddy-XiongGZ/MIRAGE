The most common type of this disorder is Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which is characterized by bone fragility, blue sclera, and joint hypermobility. Osteogenesis Imperfecta is caused by a defect in the production of type 1 collagen, which is the most abundant collagen type in the body and is found in structures such as the skin, tendon, vascular ligature, organs, and the predominant type in bone.
