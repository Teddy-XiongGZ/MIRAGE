    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of cough, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, fever, and facial tenderness over the maxillary sinuses suggest a diagnosis of sinusitis. The presence of purulent nasal discharge and facial pain are particularly indicative of bacterial sinusitis. The first-line treatment for bacterial sinusitis in children is amoxicillin. However, the patient's history of asthma and current wheezing suggest that he may also have a lower respiratory tract infection, which could be caused by organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. These organisms produce beta-lactamase, which can inactivate amoxicillin. Therefore, a beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, would be a better choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid\"}"
