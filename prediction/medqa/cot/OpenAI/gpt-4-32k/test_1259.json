    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history and physical examination suggest a clavicle fracture, which is a common injury following a fall onto the shoulder. The intact radial pulse and normal sensory examination of the right upper limb rule out vascular or nerve injury. An MRI or arteriography would be unnecessary at this point as there is no indication of a more serious injury such as a dislocation or vascular compromise. Tension banding is a surgical procedure and is not the first line of treatment for a simple clavicle fracture. The initial management of a clavicle fracture is usually conservative, involving immobilization of the shoulder using a simple sling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Apply a simple shoulder sling\"}"
