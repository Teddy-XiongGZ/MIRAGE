    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of weight gain, fatigue, constipation, bradycardia (low heart rate), and dry skin are suggestive of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. The thyroid hormones include triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). In a response to low levels of T3 and T4, the pituitary gland increases the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more T3 and T4. Therefore, in a patient with hypothyroidism, the levels of TSH would be elevated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\"}"
