Warfarin therapy (choice A) is used for anticoagulation, but there's no indication of a clotting disorder in this case. Vitamin E therapy (choice B) is sometimes used in Alzheimer's disease, but the patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a different diagnosis. Tetrabenazine (choice C) is used to treat movement disorders such as Huntington's disease, but this patient's symptoms don't fit that diagnosis. Cognitive training (choice D) could be beneficial for this patient's memory loss, but it would not address his physical symptoms or underlying disease process. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would likely involve further diagnostic testing or referral to a neurologist.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Cognitive training\"}"
