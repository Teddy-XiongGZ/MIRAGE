    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient is at 42 weeks' gestation, which is considered post-term. Post-term pregnancies are associated with several risks, including oligohydramnios, macrosomia, and meconium aspiration. The fetus may pass meconium in response to stress, such as that caused by aging of the placenta and decreased amniotic fluid volume. If the meconium is present in the amniotic fluid at the time of delivery, the infant may aspirate the meconium, leading to meconium aspiration syndrome. The other options are not specifically associated with post-term pregnancies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Meconium aspiration\"}"
