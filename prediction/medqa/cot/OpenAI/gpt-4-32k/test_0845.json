    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tissue that would promote healing in cartilaginous injuries. Cartilage is avascular, meaning it does not have a blood supply. This makes it difficult for the body to repair cartilage damage. The perichondrium is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the cartilage and provides nutrients to it. It also contains progenitor cells that can differentiate into chondrocytes, the cells that produce and maintain the cartilaginous matrix. Proteoglycans are part of the cartilage matrix but they do not have regenerative properties. Osteoblasts are involved in bone formation, not cartilage. Mature chondrocytes maintain the cartilage but they have a limited capacity for division and repair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Perichondrium\"}"
