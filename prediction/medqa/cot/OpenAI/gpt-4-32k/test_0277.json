    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been taking over-the-counter pain medications for a long time, which can lead to kidney damage. The renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation, which are characteristic of drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and ischemic acute tubular necrosis do not fit the clinical picture and biopsy findings. Nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis is usually caused by direct toxic injury to the renal tubules, but the presence of eosinophils and diffuse inflammation suggests an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, which is more consistent with toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis\"}"
