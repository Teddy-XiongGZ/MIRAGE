    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient's history of recurrent second trimester losses and physical exam finding of a firm, asymmetric uterus is suggestive of a uterine anomaly, most likely a uterine septum. Uterine anomalies are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm labor, and malpresentation. A hysterosalpingogram is a radiographic study in which contrast is injected into the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes. It is used to evaluate the shape of the uterine cavity and the patency of the fallopian tubes. Therefore, it would be the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Hysterosalpingogram\"}"
