    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a possible recurrence of myocardial infarction. In such cases, cardiac biomarkers are used to confirm the diagnosis. Among the options given, both CK-MB and Troponin T are cardiac biomarkers. However, Troponin T is more specific and sensitive for myocardial injury and remains elevated for a longer period (up to 14 days) after an infarction. Therefore, an abnormal Troponin T result would be most useful in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Troponin T\"}"
