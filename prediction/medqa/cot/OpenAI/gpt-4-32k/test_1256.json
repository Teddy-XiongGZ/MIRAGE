    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of sudden, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and an adnexal mass on physical exam is suggestive of ovarian torsion. This is a gynecological emergency that occurs when the ovary twists on its ligamentous supports, often around a mass, leading to ischemia. The presence of doppler flow does not rule out torsion, as early in the process, arterial flow may still be present. The best next step in management is surgical intervention to detorse the ovary and prevent necrosis. Laparoscopy is generally preferred over laparotomy as it is less invasive and has a quicker recovery time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Laparoscopy\"}"
