    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of regeneration of the alveolar lining after damage. The alveolar lining is composed of two types of cells: type I and type II pneumocytes. Type I pneumocytes are responsible for gas exchange, while type II pneumocytes secrete surfactant and can also proliferate and differentiate into type I pneumocytes to replace damaged cells. Therefore, the process of regeneration of the alveolar lining after damage involves the proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells, which are type II pneumocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells\"}"
