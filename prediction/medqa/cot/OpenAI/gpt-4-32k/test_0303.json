    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old female who has not yet had her first period, which is known as primary amenorrhea. However, she has normal development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast and pubic hair development, which suggests that she has normal levels of sex hormones. This is confirmed by her normal levels of FSH and estrogen. Her headaches with photosensitivity and nausea are likely migraines, given her family history. An imperforate hymen or vaginal septum would likely cause cyclic abdominal pain due to menstrual blood accumulation, which she does not have. Hyperprolactinemia would likely cause galactorrhea, which she also does not have. Therefore, given her age, normal development of secondary sexual characteristics, and absence of other symptoms, it is likely that she is simply a late bloomer and her development is normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
