    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's laboratory results show a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are enzymes found in the liver and are released into the bloodstream when liver cells are damaged. The pattern of liver injury in this patient, with a marked elevation in aminotransferases, is most consistent with hepatocellular necrosis. The liver has a dual blood supply, with the majority coming from the portal vein and a smaller portion from the hepatic artery. The oxygen tension decreases from the periportal (zone 1) to the centrilobular (zone 3) areas. Therefore, zone 3 hepatocytes are most susceptible to conditions of low oxygen supply such as shock, which this patient likely experienced due to his diverticular bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Centrilobular hepatocytes\"}"
