    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition that affects newborns and is caused by an underactive thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is responsible for producing hormones that are crucial for growth and development. Inadequate maternal iodine intake can lead to this condition as iodine is essential for thyroid hormone production. Symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism include hypotonia (low muscle tone), umbilical hernia, and macroglossia (enlarged tongue). However, diarrhea is not a typical symptom of congenital hypothyroidism. Instead, constipation is more commonly associated with this condition due to slowed gut motility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
