    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Catecholamines, glucagon, and glucocorticoids are all hormones that increase blood glucose levels, so they would not increase insulin sensitivity. On the other hand, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis. Activation of PPAR-gamma improves insulin sensitivity, making it the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma\"}"
