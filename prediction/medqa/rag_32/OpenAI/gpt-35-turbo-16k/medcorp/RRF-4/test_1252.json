    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transaminitis refers to elevated liver function tests, specifically the transaminases alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). In this case, the patient has elevated liver function tests from baseline. To determine which medication could contribute to the transaminitis, we need to consider the potential hepatotoxicity of each medication. Metformin, glyburide, and lisinopril are not known to cause hepatotoxicity. However, simvastatin, a statin medication used to lower cholesterol, has been associated with hepatotoxicity in rare cases. Therefore, the most likely medication contributing to the patient's transaminitis is simvastatin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
