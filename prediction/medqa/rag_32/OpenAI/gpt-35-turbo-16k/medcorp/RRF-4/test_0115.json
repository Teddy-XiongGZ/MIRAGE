    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head will most likely block the power stroke in cross-bridge cycling. The power stroke occurs after the myosin head binds to actin and releases inorganic phosphate (Pi), causing the myosin head to change conformation and pull the actin filament towards the center of the sarcomere. Inhibition of phosphate release would prevent the myosin head from completing the power stroke and generating force.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
