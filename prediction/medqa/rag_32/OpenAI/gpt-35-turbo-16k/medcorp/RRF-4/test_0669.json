    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with vomiting bright red blood, which is indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The EGD shows a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction. Given the patient's history of alcohol substance abuse and the presence of esophageal tear, the most likely diagnosis is Mallory-Weiss syndrome. The next best course of action would be conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation. Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding is not indicated as there is no active bleeding. Esophageal manometry and impedance studies are not necessary at this time. Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter are not appropriate for the management of Mallory-Weiss syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
