    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with recurrent wrist and neck pain, along with stiffness in the fingers in the morning that improves throughout the day. On physical examination, the metacarpophalangeal joints are erythematous and tender. These findings, along with the family history of fibromyalgia, are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis. To confirm the diagnosis, the most helpful test would be the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, as it has a high specificity for rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial fluid analysis may be useful in other joint-related conditions, but it is not the most appropriate test in this case. Rheumatoid factor is not as specific for rheumatoid arthritis as the anti-CCP antibody. X-ray of the cervical spine would not provide information specific to the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
