    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 27-year-old man who was involved in a motor vehicle collision and is presenting with chest pain. His echocardiogram is normal except for sinus tachycardia. His physical exam is notable for bruising over his chest wall. The elevated troponins and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggest cardiac involvement. Given the mechanism of injury and the presence of chest wall bruising, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac contusion, which is a bruise or injury to the heart muscle caused by blunt trauma. Hemorrhage and pulmonary contusion are possible complications of the trauma but do not explain the elevated troponins and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a transient condition that typically presents with chest pain and ECG changes resembling a heart attack, but it is not associated with trauma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is cardiac contusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
