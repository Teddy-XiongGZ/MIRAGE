    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a neck mass and is diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, he develops red urine. This is most likely due to the side effect of one of the chemotherapy drugs. To determine the cause, we need to consider the potential side effects of each drug. Bleomycin is known to cause pulmonary toxicity, not hematuria. Cyclophosphamide can cause hemorrhagic cystitis, which can present with hematuria, but it is less likely to be the cause in this case. Doxorubicin is known to cause cardiotoxicity, but not hematuria. Etoposide is associated with myelosuppression, but not hematuria. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hematuria is cyclophosphamide, making choice B the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
