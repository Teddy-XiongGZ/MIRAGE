    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of heart palpitations, chest pain, and irregularly irregular pulse, along with signs of hyperthyroidism (fine tremor, digital swelling, retraction of the left upper eyelid), the most likely diagnosis is atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be to treat the underlying hyperthyroidism with antithyroid medications such as propranolol, which is a non-selective beta-blocker that can help control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism and reduce the heart rate. Digoxin, amiodarone, and warfarin are not the first-line treatment options for hyperthyroidism-induced atrial fibrillation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
