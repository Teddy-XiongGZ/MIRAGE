    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if two loci have a high probability of being closely linked, we can look at the LOD (logarithm of odds) score. The LOD score measures the likelihood of two loci being linked based on the observed data. A LOD score greater than 3 is generally considered significant evidence for linkage, indicating a high probability of the loci being closely linked. Therefore, the answer is C. LOD Score > 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
