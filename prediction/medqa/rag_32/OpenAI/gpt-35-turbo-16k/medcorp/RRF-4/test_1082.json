    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation of itchy blisters in the axilla and the findings of tense axillary bullae that do not rupture with light touch, the most likely diagnosis is bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by tense bullae that typically occur in elderly patients. Direct immunofluorescence findings of linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane are consistent with bullous pemphigoid. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is characterized by widespread blistering and skin peeling, typically in infants and young children, and is not associated with linear immunofluorescence findings. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by flaccid bullae that easily rupture, and direct immunofluorescence findings show intercellular deposition of IgG. Cicatricial pemphigoid typically affects mucous membranes and is associated with scarring, which is not mentioned in the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
