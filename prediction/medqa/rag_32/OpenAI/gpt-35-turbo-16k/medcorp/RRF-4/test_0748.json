    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with hyperaldosteronism, which is characterized by high blood pressure, low potassium levels, and increased thirst and urinary frequency. Hyperaldosteronism is caused by excess production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the kidney to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, leading to fluid retention and potassium depletion. Therefore, the hormone excess responsible for the patient's symptoms uses intracellular receptors to exert its action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
