    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation of rapid breathing, hypoxia, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring in a premature newborn suggests respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The x-ray findings of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities are consistent with RDS. RDS is caused by surfactant deficiency in premature infants. The most likely finding on further evaluation would be hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy, as this is a characteristic histological finding in RDS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
