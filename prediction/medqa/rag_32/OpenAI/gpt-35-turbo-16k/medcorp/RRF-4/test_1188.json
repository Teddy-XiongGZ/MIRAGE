    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Positive selection is the process that ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. This process occurs during the maturation of T lymphocytes in the thymus. The T cell progenitors enter the thymus as double-negative cells (CD4-/CD8-) and then differentiate into double-positive T cells (CD4+/CD8+). During positive selection, the double-positive T cells interact with self-antigens presented on MHC molecules, and those that interact well with either MHC class I or MHC class II molecules receive a vital 'survival signal' and continue their maturation process. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Double-positive T cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
