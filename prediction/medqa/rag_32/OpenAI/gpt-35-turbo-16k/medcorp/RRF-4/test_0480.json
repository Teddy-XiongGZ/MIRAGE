    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not undergone puberty yet and has undeveloped breasts and normal external and internal female genitalia in Tanner I stage of development. This suggests a delay in puberty. The most likely cause of delayed puberty in a girl with normal external and internal female genitalia is constitutional delay of growth and puberty, which is a normal variation of growth and development. Constitutional delay of growth and puberty is characterized by delayed skeletal maturation, delayed onset of puberty, and normal development of secondary sexual characteristics. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other causes of delayed puberty should be ruled out. Aromatase enzyme deficiency, hypokalemia, and hypercortisolism are not common causes of delayed puberty in girls. XY karyotype is associated with disorders of sex development (DSD) and may present with ambiguous genitalia or primary amenorrhea, but it is not a likely finding in this patient with normal female external and internal genitalia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
