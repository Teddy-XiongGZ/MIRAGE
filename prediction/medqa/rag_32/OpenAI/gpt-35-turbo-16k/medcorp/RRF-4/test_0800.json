    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms of sudden abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool suggest a possible intoxication. Given that the child was playing with his mother's purse containing a bottle of vitamin supplements, it is likely that he ingested an excessive amount of vitamins. The mention of chronic microcytic anemia suggests that the mother's vitamin supplements may contain iron. Iron toxicity can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark-colored stool. The treatment for iron intoxication is deferoxamine, which is a chelating agent that binds to iron and enhances its excretion. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Deferoxamine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
