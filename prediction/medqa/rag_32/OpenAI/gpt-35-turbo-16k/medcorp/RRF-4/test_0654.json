    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-year-old girl who has not yet menstruated. On physical examination, she has normal breast and pubic hair development, indicating normal secondary sexual characteristics. The FSH level is within the normal range for the follicular phase, suggesting that the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is intact. The estradiol level is low, which is consistent with a lack of ovarian function. The testosterone level is within the normal range for females. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Turner syndrome (Choice C), which is characterized by primary amenorrhea, short stature, and ovarian failure. Muellerian agenesis (Choice A) would present with absent or underdeveloped uterus and vagina. Hyperprolactinemia (Choice B) would typically present with high levels of prolactin and may cause secondary amenorrhea, but it would not explain the lack of ovarian function. Androgen insensitivity (Choice D) would present with normal secondary sexual characteristics but would not explain the lack of ovarian function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
