    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus. The initial management includes stabilization with intravenous fluids and control of bleeding. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is indicated in the management of acute variceal bleeding. It reduces splanchnic blood flow and decreases portal pressure, leading to vasoconstriction of the submucosal veins and reduction in bleeding. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Nadalol, a nonselective beta-blocker, is also indicated in the management of acute variceal bleeding as it reduces portal pressure and prevents rebleeding. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, and prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, are not indicated in the management of acute variceal bleeding. Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, is not commonly used in the management of acute variceal bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
