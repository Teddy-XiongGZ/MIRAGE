    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 21-year-old woman with sudden onset of high blood pressure and facial flushing. She also has symptoms of cold intolerance and covers her feet with blankets even in warm weather. There is no family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes. On examination, her blood pressure is elevated. These findings are suggestive of a condition called pheochromocytoma, which is a rare tumor of the adrenal glands that secretes excessive amounts of catecholamines. Pheochromocytoma can cause episodic hypertension, facial flushing, and cold intolerance. It is important to rule out other causes of secondary hypertension in young patients, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, Marfan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Takayasu's arteritis. However, based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, pheochromocytoma is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"E\"}"
