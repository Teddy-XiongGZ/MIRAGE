    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with excessive sleepiness, which has significantly worsened since starting college. He reports a regular sleep schedule but still wakes up feeling exhausted and falls asleep during class and while studying. He also experiences episodes of sudden generalized body weakness, ptosis, and difficulty speaking after becoming angry. These symptoms are suggestive of narcolepsy with cataplexy. The next step in therapy for narcolepsy with cataplexy is the initiation of a stimulant medication, such as dextroamphetamine (choice B), to help improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness. Clomipramine (choice A) is an antidepressant that can be used to treat cataplexy, but it is not the best initial choice for therapy. Modafinil (choice C) is another medication used to treat excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy, but it is not as effective as stimulant medications. Sleep deprivation (choice D) is not a recommended treatment for narcolepsy and can actually worsen symptoms. Therefore, the best next step in therapy for this patient is to initiate dextroamphetamine (choice B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
