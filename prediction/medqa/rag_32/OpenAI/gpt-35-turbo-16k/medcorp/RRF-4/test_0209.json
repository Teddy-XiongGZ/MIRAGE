    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history of smoking and working as a fruit picker, as well as the examination findings of a painless ulcer near the vermillion border of the lower lip, the most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of oral cancer that is strongly associated with tobacco use and sun exposure. Aphthous stomatitis is characterized by recurrent painful ulcers, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Traumatic ulcer is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history and examination findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
