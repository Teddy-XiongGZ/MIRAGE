    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension. His blood pressure measurements have ranged from 160-170/80-100 mmHg. On physical exam, he has a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 at the right upper sternal border. The most common cause of his hypertension is likely due to aortic stenosis, as indicated by the presence of the murmur. Aortic stenosis can lead to increased afterload on the left ventricle, resulting in hypertension. Primary hyperaldosteronism and hypothyroidism can cause hypertension, but they are less common causes. Stiffening of the aorta can also contribute to hypertension, but it is less likely to be the primary cause in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
