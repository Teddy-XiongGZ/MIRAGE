    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a 3-month history of left knee pain and stiffness. She has no history of trauma and has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen for the joint pain. On examination, there is tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line, crepitus, and pain with full flexion and extension. The most likely finding on imaging of the left knee is osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray. This is suggestive of osteoarthritis, which is the most common cause of knee pain in older adults. Other findings such as diffuse lytic-sclerotic bone lesions (seen in metastatic bone disease), joint effusion and pannus (seen in rheumatoid arthritis), and fluid-filled pouch (seen in Baker's cyst) are less likely based on the clinical presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
