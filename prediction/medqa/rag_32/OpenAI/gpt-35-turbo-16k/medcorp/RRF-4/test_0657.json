    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of ischemic stroke and is now presenting with palpitations. The irregular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination suggest the possibility of atrial fibrillation, which is a known risk factor for embolic stroke. The most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs in this patient is to begin anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents and are not as effective as anticoagulation in preventing embolic strokes. Carotid endarterectomy is indicated for carotid artery stenosis, which is not the primary concern in this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Begin warfarin and heparin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
