    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this scenario has suffered a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury, and is unresponsive with dilated and non-reactive pupils. These findings are concerning for brain death. The next step in diagnosing brain death is to perform confirmatory tests. The most appropriate confirmatory test in this case is the corneal reflex test, as it assesses the function of cranial nerve V (trigeminal nerve) and cranial nerve VII (facial nerve), which are important for brainstem function. Electroencephalography (Choice A) may be used as a confirmatory test in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Magnetic resonance angiography (Choice B) is not necessary for diagnosing brain death. Deep tendon reflex testing (Choice C) is not specific for brain death and may be present even in the absence of brainstem function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
