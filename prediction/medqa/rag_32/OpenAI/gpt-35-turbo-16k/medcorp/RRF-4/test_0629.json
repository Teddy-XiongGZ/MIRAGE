    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient experienced a collision from the front, resulting in severe knee pain and an inability to stand up. On physical examination, the knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. These findings suggest a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. The PCL runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle to the posterior aspect of the tibia. Therefore, the anatomic structure most likely injured in this patient is the PCL, which runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
