    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the direct effects of hydroxyurea on the hemoglobin physiology of patients with sickle cell anemia. To answer this question, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [12] states that hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin in some patients with sickle cell disease. Document [14] also mentions that hydroxyurea increases the fraction of HbF (fetal hemoglobin) found in adults. Based on this information, we can conclude that hydroxyurea treatment increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) in patients with sickle cell anemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
