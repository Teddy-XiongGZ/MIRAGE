    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant is presenting with jaundice, poor latch during breastfeeding, and inadequate milk intake. Breast milk jaundice is a common cause of prolonged jaundice in breastfed infants and is characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that peaks at 1-2 weeks of age and resolves by 12 weeks of age. Breastfeeding jaundice, on the other hand, is caused by inadequate milk intake leading to dehydration and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Sepsis and physiologic hyperbilirubinemia are less likely in this case as the infant is otherwise well and has a normal stool frequency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
