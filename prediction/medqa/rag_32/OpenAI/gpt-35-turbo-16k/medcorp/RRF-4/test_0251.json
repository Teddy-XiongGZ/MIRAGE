    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 71-year-old man with urinary hesitancy and nocturia, and a slightly enlarged prostate on digital rectal exam. The serum PSA is 6 ng/mL. The transabdominal ultrasound image is not provided, so we cannot use it to make a decision. The symptoms and findings are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a common condition in older men. The optimal treatment for BPH includes medications that target the underlying pathophysiology of the condition. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the main hormone responsible for prostate growth. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride can help shrink the prostate and relieve urinary symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Finasteride.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
