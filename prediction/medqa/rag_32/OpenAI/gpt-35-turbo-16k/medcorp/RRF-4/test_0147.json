The stealing provides immediate relief from stress or anxiety, but is followed by feelings of guilt and shame. The most appropriate next step in management would be cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT has been shown to be effective in treating kleptomania by helping the patient identify and challenge the thoughts and beliefs that contribute to the stealing behavior, as well as developing alternative coping strategies for managing stress and anxiety.
