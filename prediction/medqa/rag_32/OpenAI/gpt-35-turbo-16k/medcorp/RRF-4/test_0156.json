Acute dystonia is a side effect of antipsychotic medications, which are commonly used to treat schizophrenia. The patient's history of schizophrenia and recent increase in medication dosage support this diagnosis. The most appropriate treatment for acute dystonia is an anticholinergic medication, such as benztropine (Choice B).
