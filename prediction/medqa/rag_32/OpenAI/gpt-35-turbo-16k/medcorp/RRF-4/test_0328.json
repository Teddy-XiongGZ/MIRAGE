    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing hypotension after receiving epidural anesthesia. The most likely cause of her hypotension is sympathetic block, which is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia. Sympathetic block can lead to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance, resulting in hypotension. Hypovolemia and acute pulmonary hypertension are less likely in this case because the patient's vital signs are within normal limits and there are no signs of fluid loss or pulmonary hypertension. Aortocaval compression is also less likely because the patient is not in a supine position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
