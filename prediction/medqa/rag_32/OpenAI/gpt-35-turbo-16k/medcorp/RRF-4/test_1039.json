    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, and discomfort in her legs when lying down at night, which is relieved by movement. These symptoms are consistent with restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS is often associated with a family history, as seen in this patient's brother. The first-line treatment for RLS is a dopamine agonist, such as pramipexole (Choice B). Amitriptyline (Choice A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that may be used for RLS in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this patient. Codeine (Choice C) is an opioid analgesic and is not indicated for the treatment of RLS. Escitalopram (Choice D) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant and is not effective for RLS. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is pramipexole (Choice B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
