    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of dressing in black, social isolation, poor academic performance, and preoccupation with paranormal phenomena suggest a possible diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior, social and interpersonal deficits, and cognitive or perceptual distortions. The patient's anxiety in social situations and avoidance of eye contact are consistent with social anxiety disorder, but the other symptoms are more indicative of schizotypal personality disorder. Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by social inhibition and feelings of inadequacy, but it does not typically involve the preoccupation with paranormal phenomena seen in this patient. Schizophrenia is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a personality disorder rather than a psychotic disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
