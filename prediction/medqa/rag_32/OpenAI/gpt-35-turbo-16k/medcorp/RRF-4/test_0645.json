    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation and examination findings, as well as the histopathological examination of the thyroid tumor, the most likely finding on microscopic examination of the mass is capsular invasion. The patient has a hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing, which is consistent with a thyroid mass. The ultrasound shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. The inconclusive fine-needle aspiration biopsy and the invasion of surrounding blood vessels seen during surgery suggest a malignant thyroid tumor. Capsular invasion is a common feature of thyroid malignancies, indicating the spread of tumor cells beyond the thyroid capsule. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Capsular invasion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
