    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient is exhibiting symptoms of psychosis, including auditory hallucinations and a sudden change in behavior. The question asks for a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition. In general, negative symptoms, such as flat affect and social withdrawal, are associated with a poorer prognosis in psychosis. Therefore, the correct answer is not D. Being single or male sex are not necessarily predictors of good prognosis for psychosis. Affective symptoms, such as mood instability or depression, are not mentioned in the patient's presentation and therefore cannot be considered as a predictor of prognosis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is not A, B, or C. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
