    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The disease in question is likely cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the symptoms described. CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must be carriers of the CF gene mutation for their child to have the disease. The prevalence of the disease in the population of the man is given as 1/100, indicating that the carrier frequency is 1/50. The woman is affected by the disease, so she must be a carrier. Therefore, the chance that she will pass on the CF gene mutation to her child is 1/2. The chance that the man will pass on the CF gene mutation is also 1/2. To calculate the chance that their child will have the disease, we multiply these probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. Therefore, the chance that their child will have the disease is 1/4, which is equivalent to 25/100.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 81/100\"}"
