    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the therapeutic index, we need to divide the dose that produces toxicity by the dose that produces a therapeutic effect. In this case, the dose that produces toxicity is the dose at which the adverse event rate is highest, which is the 100 mg dose with 47/52 patients experiencing a treatment-related adverse event. The dose that produces a therapeutic effect is the dose at which the improvement rate is highest, which is the 40 mg dose with 46/51 patients demonstrating improvement. Therefore, the therapeutic index is 100 mg/40 mg = 2.5.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
