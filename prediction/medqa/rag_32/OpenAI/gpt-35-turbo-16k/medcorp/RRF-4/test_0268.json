    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient has a sensorineural hearing loss. This is supported by the findings of equal hearing on both ears when the vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead and air conduction being greater than bone conduction when the tuning fork is placed by the ear and on the mastoid process. Sensorineural hearing loss is typically caused by dysfunction of the cochlea, which is responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. Therefore, the most likely impaired structure in this patient is the cochlea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
