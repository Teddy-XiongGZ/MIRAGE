    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 1-day history of progressive pain and blurry vision in his right eye. He is struggling to open this eye because of the pain. His left eye is asymptomatic. He wears contact lenses. He has bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. He works as a kindergarten teacher. The vital signs are within normal limits. The examination shows a visual acuity in the left eye of 20/25 and the ability to count fingers at 3 feet in the right eye. A photograph of the right eye is shown. Based on the history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute angle-closure glaucoma. This is supported by the sudden onset of pain, blurry vision, and decreased visual acuity in the affected eye. The presence of a red eye and the inability to open the eye due to pain are also consistent with angle-closure glaucoma. Contact lens use and bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol are not specific to any particular diagnosis in this case. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, herpes simplex keratitis, and pseudomonas keratitis are less likely given the absence of significant conjunctival injection, discharge, or corneal findings on examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
