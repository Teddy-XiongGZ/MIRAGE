    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 6-week history of loose, nonbloody stools, abdominal pain, intermittent nausea, and fever. The CT scan shows mural thickening and surrounding fat stranding of discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon. These findings are suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To confirm the diagnosis, a colonoscopy is performed and biopsy specimens of the affected areas of the colon are taken. The most specific finding for this patient's condition would be the presence of noncaseating granulomas, which are characteristic of Crohn's disease, a type of IBD. Neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts and neutrophil-rich pseudomembranes are more commonly seen in conditions such as infectious colitis or pseudomembranous colitis. Pseudopolyps are typically seen in chronic ulcerative colitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
