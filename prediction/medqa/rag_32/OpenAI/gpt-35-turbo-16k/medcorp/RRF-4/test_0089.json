These findings are consistent with hyperthyroidism. Given that the patient is pregnant, the treatment options need to be considered carefully. Methimazole and propylthiouracil are both antithyroid medications that can be used in pregnancy, but propylthiouracil is generally preferred in the first trimester due to a lower risk of congenital malformations.
