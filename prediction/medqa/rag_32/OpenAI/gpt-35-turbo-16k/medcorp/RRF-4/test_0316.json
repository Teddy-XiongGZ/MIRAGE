    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of depression, including low mood, difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, and loss of interest. She also has a history of binge eating and purging behavior. Given these symptoms and history, it is important to consider the possibility of an underlying eating disorder, specifically bulimia nervosa. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for bulimia nervosa, and fluoxetine is the only FDA-approved medication for this condition. Therefore, treatment with fluoxetine would be appropriate in this patient. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders due to its potential to lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk of seizures. Citalopram and trazodone are also commonly used antidepressants, but they are not specifically indicated for the treatment of bulimia nervosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
