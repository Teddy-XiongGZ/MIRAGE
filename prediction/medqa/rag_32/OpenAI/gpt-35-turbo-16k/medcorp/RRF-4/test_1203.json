Omeprazole does not interfere with the metabolism of bupropion.\\n\\nB. Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products. - This statement is incorrect. Bupropion can be effective as a standalone treatment for smoking cessation.\\n\\nC. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder. - This statement is correct.
