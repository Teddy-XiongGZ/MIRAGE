    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this case presents with multiple ecchymoses, petechiae, purpura, bleeding from lacerations, and laboratory findings consistent with coagulopathy (prolonged PT and aPTT, low platelet count). These findings are indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a systemic activation of the coagulation cascade resulting in widespread clot formation and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. DIC can occur in the setting of severe trauma and is associated with poor outcomes. Air embolization and tension pneumothorax would not explain the bleeding and laboratory findings seen in this patient. Coagulopathy of trauma is a broad term that encompasses various mechanisms of abnormal coagulation in trauma, but DIC is the most likely diagnosis in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
