    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the test's overall specificity, we need to determine the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives. In this case, the number of true negatives is 580 (the number of patients without PD who had a negative scan), and the number of false positives is 20 (the number of patients without PD who had a positive scan). Therefore, the test's overall specificity is 580 / (580 + 20).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
