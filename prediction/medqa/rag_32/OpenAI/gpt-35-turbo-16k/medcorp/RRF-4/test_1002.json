    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a previously healthy young man who presents with dizziness and palpitations after attending a bachelor party where he consumed excessive alcohol. The ECG shows a wide QRS complex tachycardia. Given the history of alcohol consumption and the ECG findings, the most likely diagnosis is ventricular tachycardia (Choice C). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Choice A) is less likely in a young healthy individual without underlying cardiac disease. Brugada syndrome (Choice B) typically presents with ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads on ECG, which is not seen in this case. Sick sinus syndrome (Choice D) is unlikely in a young patient without any other symptoms or risk factors. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is ventricular tachycardia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
