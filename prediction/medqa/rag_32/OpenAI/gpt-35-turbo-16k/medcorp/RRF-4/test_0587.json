    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 33-year-old G2P1 woman with poor diabetic control and a fundal height of 20 cm at 18 weeks gestation. The question asks for the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound. Based on the information provided, it is important to consider the association between poor diabetic control and fetal abnormalities. The most likely congenital abnormality in this case is spina bifida, as it is commonly associated with poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy. Sacral agenesis and amelia are also associated with poorly controlled diabetes, but spina bifida is more commonly seen. Ventricular septal defect is not typically associated with poorly controlled diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
