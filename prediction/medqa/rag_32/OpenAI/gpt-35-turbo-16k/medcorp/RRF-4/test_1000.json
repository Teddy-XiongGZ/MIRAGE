    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness, and weight loss. He also has an unstable, wide-based ataxic gait. Laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level, high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear. These findings are consistent with megaloblastic anemia. The most likely cause of megaloblastic anemia in this patient is vitamin B12 deficiency. Hypothyroidism and parvovirus infection are not associated with megaloblastic anemia. Folate deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, but it is less likely in this case as the patient is a vegetarian and folate deficiency is more commonly seen in individuals with poor dietary intake. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Vitamin B12 deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
