    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemoptysis, which are suggestive of a pulmonary embolism. The large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels seen on imaging further supports this diagnosis. The fact that the patient's symptoms are not associated with a known provoking factor suggests that this may be a spontaneous event. Given the normal blood test results after treatment, it is likely that the patient does not have an underlying coagulation disorder. Therefore, the most likely cause of the pulmonary embolism in this patient is a genetic predisposition. Autosomal dominant, autosomal partial dominance, and X-linked dominant inheritance patterns would all require a family history of the condition, which is not mentioned in the case. X-linked recessive inheritance is less likely in this case as it typically presents in males and is associated with a family history. Therefore, the most likely mode of inheritance in this case is autosomal recessive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. X-linked recessive\"}"
