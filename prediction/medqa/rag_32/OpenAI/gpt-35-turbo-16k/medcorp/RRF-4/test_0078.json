    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn is presenting with extreme cyanosis immediately after birth, progressive respiratory failure, a single loud S2 heart sound, and a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. These findings, along with an enlarged 'egg-shaped' heart on radiography, are consistent with the diagnosis of persistent truncus arteriosus. Persistent truncus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect characterized by a single arterial trunk arising from the heart, instead of the normal separation of the pulmonary artery and aorta. This results in mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to cyanosis. The machine-like murmur is caused by the continuous flow of blood from the arterial trunk into the pulmonary arteries. Atrial septostomy is a palliative procedure performed to improve oxygenation in newborns with persistent truncus arteriosus before definitive surgical correction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
