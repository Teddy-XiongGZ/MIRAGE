The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that is not typically used as a first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that can be effective for social anxiety disorder, but it is generally reserved for treatment-resistant cases due to its side effect profile and dietary restrictions. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can help with the physical symptoms of anxiety, but it does not address the underlying cognitive and behavioral aspects of social anxiety disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
