    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the statistical power of the screening test, we need to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Sensitivity is the proportion of patients with the disease who have a positive test result, and specificity is the proportion of patients without the disease who have a negative test result. From the given table, we can calculate the sensitivity as 45/(45+5) = 0.9 and the specificity as 35/(35+15) = 0.7. Statistical power is the probability of correctly detecting a true positive result. It is influenced by both sensitivity and sample size. However, the sample size is not provided in the question, so we cannot determine the exact power of the test. Therefore, the correct answer is: A. Repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
