    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the development of capsular polysaccharide vaccines, specifically the Hib vaccine. Document [0] states that polysaccharide antigens elicit a T-independent immune response, characterized by lack of memory and poor immunogenicity, especially in infants. However, by conjugating the polysaccharide to a protein carrier, it is possible to induce a T-dependent immune response against these antigens. Document [5] also mentions that attaching the Hib polysaccharide to a protein carrier greatly increases the ability of the immune system of young children to recognize the polysaccharide and develop immunity. Based on this information, the best response to the medical student's question would be that conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
