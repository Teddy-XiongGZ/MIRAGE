    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension. The ECG findings of left axis deviation, Q wave in lead III, constant PR interval with nonconducted P waves, and QRS interval of .09 seconds suggest a high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient's symptoms and vital signs indicate hemodynamic compromise. The most appropriate next step in management is cardiac pacing to restore normal AV conduction and improve cardiac output.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
