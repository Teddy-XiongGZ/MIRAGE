    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 4-week history of constipation and a change in bowel habits. He also reports fatigue and decreased interest in activities. Physical examination is unremarkable. Based on the symptoms and history, the most likely cause of constipation in this patient is medication-induced. The patient's medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed medically. Therefore, the most likely cellular target of the medicine responsible for his symptoms is the Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule. Medications that inhibit this cotransporter, such as thiazide diuretics, can cause constipation as a side effect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
