    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations. Option A, oral prednisone, is commonly used in the treatment of acute exacerbations, but it is not the best choice for long-term prevention of exacerbations. Option B, supplemental oxygen, is important for managing hypoxemia but does not directly reduce the risk of exacerbations. Option C, montelukast, is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that is primarily used in the treatment of asthma and is not recommended for the prevention of COPD exacerbations. Option D, nebulized N-acetylcysteine, is an antioxidant that has been shown to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Therefore, the best choice for reducing the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months is nebulized N-acetylcysteine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
