    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of nervousness, anxiety, racing thoughts, insomnia, and physical symptoms such as muscle tension and dizziness, it is likely that he is experiencing generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a chronic condition characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about various aspects of life. The first-line treatment for GAD is usually psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, in this case, since the patient's symptoms are severe and interfering with his daily functioning, pharmacotherapy may be considered. Among the given options, diazepam and alprazolam are benzodiazepines, which are effective in treating anxiety symptoms but are generally not recommended as first-line treatment due to their potential for dependence and side effects. Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist primarily used for insomnia and would not address the patient's anxiety symptoms. Buspirone, on the other hand, is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that is commonly used for the treatment of GAD. It has a lower risk of dependence and side effects compared to benzodiazepines. Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient's symptoms would be option C. Buspirone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
