    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, there is an increased demand for oxygen and nutrients by the muscles. To meet this demand, the body increases cardiac output by increasing heart rate and stroke volume. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for this increase in heart rate and stroke volume. The sympathetic nervous system also causes vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure. Therefore, the most likely responsible for the change in heart rate and blood pressure in this scenario is sympathetic nervous system activation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
