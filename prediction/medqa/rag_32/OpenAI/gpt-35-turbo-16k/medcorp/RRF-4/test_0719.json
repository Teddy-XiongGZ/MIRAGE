    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which enzyme is most likely to be absent in cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. To answer this, we need to refer to the relevant documents and find information about bisphosphoglycerate mutase and its function. Document [1] states that bisphosphoglycerate mutase is responsible for synthesizing 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), which is an effector of the delivery of O2 in the tissues. It also mentions that the enzyme displays phosphatase and mutase activities both involving 2,3-BPG in their reaction. None of the other documents provide information directly related to the function of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. Therefore, based on the information from Document [1], we can conclude that the enzyme most likely to be absent in cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is C. Glutathione reductase, as it is not mentioned to be involved in the synthesis or metabolism of 2,3-BPG.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
