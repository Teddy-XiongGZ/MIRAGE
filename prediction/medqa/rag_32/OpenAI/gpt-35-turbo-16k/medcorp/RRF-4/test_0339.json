    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with arachnophobia, which is an extreme and irrational fear of spiders. The most effective treatment for phobias is desensitization, which involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled and safe manner. This helps the patient to gradually overcome their fear and reduce anxiety. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker medication used to treat high blood pressure and heart conditions, and it is not indicated for the treatment of phobias. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine medication used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not the first-line treatment for specific phobias. Psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is another effective treatment option for phobias, but desensitization is the most specific and targeted approach for overcoming arachnophobia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
