    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and the ECG shows ST-segment elevation, indicating ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The elevated troponins confirm myocardial injury. The best next step in the management of this patient is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the blocked coronary artery and minimize myocardial damage. Intravenous alteplase is not indicated in STEMI as it is associated with higher bleeding risk and worse outcomes compared to PCI. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is not the initial treatment of choice for STEMI. Oral ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, may be started later in the management of the patient to improve long-term outcomes, but it is not the immediate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
