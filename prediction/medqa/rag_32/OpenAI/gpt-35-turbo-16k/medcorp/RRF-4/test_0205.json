    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After splenectomy, patients are at increased risk of sepsis, particularly overwhelming post-splenectomy sepsis (OPSI) due to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Therefore, patients should receive vaccinations to protect against these organisms. In this case, the patient should receive vaccinations for H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae. Hepatitis B vaccination is not necessary in this case as it is not directly related to the risk of OPSI. Tetanus vaccination is also not necessary as the patient's chart indicates that her vaccinations are up to date.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. I, III, IV\"}"
