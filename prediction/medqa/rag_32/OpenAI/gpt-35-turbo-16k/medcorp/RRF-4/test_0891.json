    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with preterm labor at 26 weeks' gestation. The contractions are frequent, increasing in intensity, and the cervix is dilated to 5 cm. The goal in managing preterm labor is to delay delivery and administer corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation. The most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate tocolytic therapy to inhibit uterine contractions and delay delivery. The options for tocolytic therapy include misoprostol, nifedipine, and other agents such as terbutaline or magnesium sulfate. However, misoprostol is not a commonly used tocolytic agent and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used as a tocolytic agent. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate nifedipine therapy (Choice C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
