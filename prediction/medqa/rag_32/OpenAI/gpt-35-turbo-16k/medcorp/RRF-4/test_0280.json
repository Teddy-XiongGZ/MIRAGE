    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and history, it is evident that he is experiencing a specific phobia related to flying. The patient reports avoidance behavior, distress, and impairment in his personal and professional life due to his fear. The best therapy for specific phobias is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a well-established treatment that focuses on identifying and challenging irrational thoughts and beliefs, as well as gradually exposing the patient to the feared situation (in this case, flying) in a controlled and systematic manner. This helps the patient to develop coping strategies and reduce anxiety. Medications such as alprazolam and fluoxetine may be used as adjunctive treatments in some cases, but they are not the first-line treatment for specific phobias. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is not recommended for specific phobias as it focuses more on exploring unconscious conflicts and childhood experiences rather than directly addressing the fear and its associated symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
