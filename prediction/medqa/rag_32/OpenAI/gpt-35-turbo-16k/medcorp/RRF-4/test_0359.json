    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 40-year-old male presenting with weakness in climbing stairs and brushing hair. There are no headaches or changes in vision. The muscle biopsy reveals CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. This pattern of muscle weakness and the biopsy findings are consistent with an inflammatory myopathy. Among the options provided, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis (choice C) as it is characterized by CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the muscle tissue. Systemic lupus erythematosus (choice A) is an autoimmune disease that can cause muscle weakness, but it typically presents with other systemic symptoms and has a different pattern of muscle involvement. Polymyalgia rheumatica (choice B) is characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulders and hips, but does not typically cause muscle weakness. Dermatomyositis (choice D) is another inflammatory myopathy, but it is characterized by CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration and is often associated with characteristic skin findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
