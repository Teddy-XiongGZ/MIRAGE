    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the diagnostic test will be affected, we need to consider the changes in true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) as the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases. In this case, the prevalence of CMV retinitis is decreasing due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy. As a result, the number of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP) will decrease, while the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) will increase. The positive predictive value (PPV) is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), and the negative predictive value (NPV) is calculated as TN / (TN + FN). Since both TP and FP are decreasing, the PPV will decrease. On the other hand, since both TN and FN are increasing, the NPV will increase. Therefore, the correct answer is B. PPV decreases, NPV increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
