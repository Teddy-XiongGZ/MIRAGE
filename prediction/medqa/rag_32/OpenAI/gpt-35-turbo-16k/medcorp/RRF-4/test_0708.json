    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with jaundice, lethargy, and decreased muscle tone, which are consistent with a condition called kernicterus. Kernicterus is caused by severe hyperbilirubinemia, which is characterized by high levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The liver function tests show elevated levels of total bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin, while the conjugated bilirubin is within normal limits. This pattern suggests that the underlying cause is a defect in bilirubin metabolism, specifically the conjugation of bilirubin in the liver. The most likely cause of this condition is Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1, which is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin. This condition is known as Gilbert syndrome, a genetic disorder that leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
