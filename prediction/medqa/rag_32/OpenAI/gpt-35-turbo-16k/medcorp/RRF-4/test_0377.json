To confirm the diagnosis, serologic testing for viral hepatitis should be performed. Among the options provided, HBsAg is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis. Anti-HAV IgG would be positive in a patient with previous exposure to hepatitis A virus, but it does not confirm acute infection. Anti-HCV IgG would be positive in a patient with previous exposure to hepatitis C virus, but it does not confirm acute infection.
