    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The quadruple screening test measures maternal serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG), estriol, and inhibin A. In this case, the patient has an elevated AFP level, but normal levels of \u03b2-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. An elevated AFP level is most commonly associated with neural tube defects (NTDs). Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is a neural tube defect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
