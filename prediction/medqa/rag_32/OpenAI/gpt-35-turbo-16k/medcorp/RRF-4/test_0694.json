    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The presence of splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, posterior auricular lymphadenopathy, and positive heterophile antibody screen are all suggestive of IM. The best management for IM is supportive care, including bed rest and activity limitation to prevent splenic rupture. Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication used for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which is not indicated in this case. Amoxicillin is not recommended as it can cause a rash in patients with EBV infection. Prednisone is not routinely recommended for the treatment of IM and should only be considered in severe cases with airway compromise or hemolytic anemia. Therefore, the best management for this patient's condition is bed rest and activity limitation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
