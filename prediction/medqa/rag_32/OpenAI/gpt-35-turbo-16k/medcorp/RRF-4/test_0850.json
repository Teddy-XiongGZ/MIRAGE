    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of being struck by a high-voltage power line and the presence of severe pain and a burn on the right arm, the first priority is to assess for any life-threatening injuries or complications. The most appropriate initial diagnostic test in this case would be a FAST ultrasound assessment. This test can quickly evaluate for any internal bleeding or organ damage, which may be present due to the electrical injury. Urinalysis would not be the first choice as it is not likely to provide immediate information about the patient's condition. X-ray of the arm and shoulder may be useful to assess for fractures or other injuries, but it is not the most urgent test in this case. EEG is not indicated as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with musculoskeletal and soft tissue injuries rather than neurological involvement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
