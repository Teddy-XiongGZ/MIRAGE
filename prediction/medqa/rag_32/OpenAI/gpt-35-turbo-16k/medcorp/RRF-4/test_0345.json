    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of generalized pruritus, raised erythematous plaques, clear liquid discharge from the nose, and sneezing, along with a history of similar symptoms after eating seafood, the most likely diagnosis is an allergic reaction, specifically an allergic urticarial reaction. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this condition is an antihistamine. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that is effective in relieving symptoms of allergic reactions, including pruritus and urticaria. Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine that is also effective in treating allergic reactions, but it has a lower sedative effect compared to diphenhydramine. Vitamin K is not indicated for the treatment of allergic reactions. Calamine lotion is a topical agent used for the relief of itching and irritation associated with skin conditions such as poison ivy or insect bites, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for an allergic urticarial reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
