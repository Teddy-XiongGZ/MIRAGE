    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with blurred vision and pain around the right eye, which is suggestive of an ophthalmic condition. The physical examination findings of pupillary constriction in the left eye and pupillary dilation in the right eye indicate a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), which is a sign of optic nerve dysfunction. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), so additional history should be obtained regarding symptoms suggestive of MS, such as sensory loss (choice D). Therefore, the correct answer is D. Sensory loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
