    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tissue sample from the normal thyroid gland shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. This is characteristic of simple cuboidal epithelium. To determine which part of the female reproductive tract is also lined by this type of epithelium, we need to consider the characteristics of the different parts. The ovaries are not lined by epithelium, but rather contain germinal cells. The vagina is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, not simple cuboidal epithelium. The fallopian tubes are lined by simple columnar epithelium, not simple cuboidal epithelium. The vulva is not a part of the female reproductive tract, but rather refers to the external genitalia. Therefore, none of the given options are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
