    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The difference observed between the two strata (CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3) suggests that there is effect modification. Effect modification occurs when the relationship between an exposure and an outcome differs depending on the level of another variable. In this case, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk differs depending on the level of CD4+ cell count. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Effect modification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
