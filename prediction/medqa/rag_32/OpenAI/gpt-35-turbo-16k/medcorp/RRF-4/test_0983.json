    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has small esophageal varices with red spots, which puts him at risk for bleeding. The next best step to prevent bleeding in this patient is to start nonselective beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, have been shown to reduce the risk of variceal bleeding in patients with small esophageal varices. Endoscopic sclerotherapy is typically reserved for patients with large varices or those who have already experienced variceal bleeding. Repeat endoscopy is not necessary at this time since the patient's varices have already been visualized. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Nadolol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
