    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Darunavir is a protease inhibitor that works by inhibiting the action of the HIV-1 protease enzyme, which is necessary for the virus to replicate and mature. The question asks about the mechanism of action of DN501, a new drug with the same mechanism as darunavir but fewer side effects. Since darunavir inhibits the HIV-1 protease, it can be inferred that DN501 also inhibits the HIV-1 protease. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Inhibits viral assembly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
