    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. This suggests an underlying immunodeficiency disorder. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date, ruling out primary immunodeficiencies. The presence of pus-secreting lesions and enlarged lymph nodes suggests a defect in neutrophil function. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by defective phagocyte function, specifically impaired oxidative burst in neutrophils. Atopic dermatitis and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome do not typically present with recurrent infections and pus-secreting lesions. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is characterized by recurrent infections and abnormal neutrophil function, but it also presents with oculocutaneous albinism and peripheral neuropathy, which are not mentioned in the case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
