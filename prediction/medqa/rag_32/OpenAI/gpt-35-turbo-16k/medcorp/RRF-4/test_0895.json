    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is suspected to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder based on the clinical presentation and referral to a geneticist. Trinucleotide repeat disorders are genetic disorders caused by the expansion of a repeated sequence of three nucleotides in a gene. These disorders can have different inheritance patterns depending on the specific gene involved. In this case, the patient's facial features and speech delay are consistent with Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by an expansion of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Fragile X syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, so the most likely inheritance pattern for this disorder is D. X-linked dominant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
