    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a rapidly increasing right breast mass. On examination, a large multinodular mass is palpated in the right outer quadrant of the breast. Mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy of the mass reveals papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a phyllodes tumor. Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial tumors of the breast that can present as rapidly growing masses. They are characterized by the presence of papillary projections and can show hyperplasia and atypia on histology.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
