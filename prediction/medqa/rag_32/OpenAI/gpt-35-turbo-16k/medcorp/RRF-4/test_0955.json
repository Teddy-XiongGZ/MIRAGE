    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of worsening dyspnea and fatigue with minimal exertion, as well as the presence of pitting edema in the lower extremities, the patient's New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification for congestive heart failure can be determined. NYHA Class IIa is defined as symptoms of heart failure with ordinary physical activity causing slight limitation of functional capacity. NYHA Class IIb is defined as symptoms of heart failure with ordinary physical activity causing marked limitation of functional capacity. NYHA Class III is defined as symptoms of heart failure with less than ordinary physical activity causing marked limitation of functional capacity. NYHA Class IV is defined as symptoms of heart failure at rest or with any physical activity, with discomfort increasing with any physical activity. Given the patient's inability to perform simple tasks without becoming burdened and the presence of pitting edema, the most appropriate classification for this patient would be NYHA Class III.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. New York Heart Association Class III\"}"
