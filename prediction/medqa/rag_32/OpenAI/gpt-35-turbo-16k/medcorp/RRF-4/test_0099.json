    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Abnormal discharge from the nipples and diminished sexual drive are symptoms suggestive of hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by certain antipsychotic medications. Haloperidol, fluphenazine, and risperidone are all known to increase prolactin levels and can therefore cause these symptoms. Bromocriptine, on the other hand, is a dopamine agonist that is used to treat hyperprolactinemia. It works by inhibiting the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. Therefore, bromocriptine is NOT likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
