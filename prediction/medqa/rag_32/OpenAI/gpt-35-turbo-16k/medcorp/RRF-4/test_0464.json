    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge, which are consistent with a spontaneous abortion. However, upon hearing the news, the patient becomes angry, aggressive, and self-harms by lacerating her wrists. This behavior is suggestive of a maladaptive response to the loss, indicating a psychological disturbance. Given the impulsive and self-destructive behavior, as well as the intense fear of abandonment and unstable self-image, the most likely diagnosis is borderline personality disorder (B). Antisocial personality disorder (A) is characterized by a disregard for the rights of others and a lack of empathy, which does not align with the patient's behavior. Normal grief response (C) would not typically involve self-harm and aggressive behavior. Post-traumatic stress disorder (D) may involve re-experiencing traumatic events, but it does not explain the patient's impulsive and self-destructive behavior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
