    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The drug that improved the boy's symptoms is ipratropium bromide, which is an anticholinergic medication. Anticholinergic medications work by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in bronchoconstriction. The second messenger system affected by ipratropium bromide is the phosphoinositol system. Acetylcholine binds to muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle cells in the airways, leading to activation of the phosphoinositol system and subsequent bronchoconstriction. By blocking the muscarinic receptors, ipratropium bromide inhibits the phosphoinositol system and promotes bronchodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
