    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a suboptimal glycemic control with an HbA1C of 8.5% and a serum glucose of 240 mg/dL, indicating the need for additional therapy. Since the patient has only been on metformin for 3 months and is already experiencing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, it is reasonable to consider adding another medication to improve glycemic control. Options for add-on therapy include sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. However, given the patient's relatively short duration of diabetes and the fact that he is not experiencing severe symptoms or complications, it is reasonable to choose an oral agent as the next step. Therefore, the best next step in this patient's condition would be to add a sulfonylurea (Choice C) to his current metformin therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
