    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with periodic painful double vision that occurs only when looking sideways, adduction deficits in both eyes, nystagmus in the opposite eye when looking in each direction, and bilateral disc hyperemia. These findings are consistent with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is caused by a lesion affecting the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). The MLF connects the abducens nucleus in the pons to the oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain, allowing for coordinated eye movements. Demyelination of the MLF is the most likely cause of this patient's findings, suggesting a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
