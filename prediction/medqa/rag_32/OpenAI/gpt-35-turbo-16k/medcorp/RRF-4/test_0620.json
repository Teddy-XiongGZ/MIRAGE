    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is being given a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. This description matches the mechanism of action of triamterene, which is a potassium-sparing diuretic. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that acts on the early distal convoluted tubule. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that acts on the proximal convoluted tubule. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Triamterene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
