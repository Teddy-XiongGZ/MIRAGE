    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen because there is a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The drug in the new regimen acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. Based on this information, the most likely drug is Raltegravir. Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that blocks the integration of viral DNA into the host cell DNA, thus preventing viral replication. It does not require intracellular phosphorylation for its antiviral activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
