    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with swelling of the legs, which is a common side effect of certain medications used to treat hypertension. The most likely drug causing the swelling is a calcium channel blocker, such as amlodipine. Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker and does not typically cause leg swelling. Spironolactone is a diuretic that can be used to treat edema, but it is not commonly used as a first-line treatment for hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can also cause leg swelling, but it is less likely to be the cause in this case since the patient's laboratory studies are within the reference ranges.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Amlodipine\"}"
