    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 42-year-old man with AIDS presenting with symptoms of fever, cough, malaise, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Blood cultures grew acid-fast organisms, and a PPD skin test showed 4 mm of induration. These findings are suggestive of disseminated tuberculosis. Given the patient's immunocompromised state, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a combination of azithromycin and ethambutol (Choice D). Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and ethambutol is a first-line antituberculosis agent that inhibits mycobacterial cell wall synthesis. This combination therapy is recommended for the treatment of disseminated tuberculosis in patients with AIDS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
