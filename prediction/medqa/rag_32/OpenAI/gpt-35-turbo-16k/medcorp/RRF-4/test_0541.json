    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the inference on the association between young age MI and educational status, we need to consider the odds ratio and its confidence interval. The odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that individuals with low education have 2.1 times higher odds of having a MI compared to those with high education. However, the confidence interval of 0.9-9.7 includes 1, indicating that the association is not statistically significant. Therefore, the correct inference is that the association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor for young age MI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
