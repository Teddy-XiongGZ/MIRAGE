    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance, along with a harsh pansystolic murmur that becomes louder with squatting. These findings are suggestive of a congenital heart defect. The fact that the murmur is localized over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd-3rd intercostal space suggests involvement of the left ventricular outflow tract. The murmur becoming louder with squatting is characteristic of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), which is commonly caused by a defect in the infundibular septum. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Infundibular septum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
