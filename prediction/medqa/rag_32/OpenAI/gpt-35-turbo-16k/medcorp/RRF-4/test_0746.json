    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, diaphoresis, and shivering, which are consistent with serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central nervous system. It can be triggered by the use of serotonergic medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or by the combination of multiple serotonergic agents. The patient's history of major depressive disorder and current use of citalopram, an SSRI, suggests that medication change (choice C) may be a contributing factor. However, the patient's recent initiation of a low-carbohydrate diet and use of an amino acid supplement are also important considerations. Low-carbohydrate diets can lead to increased serotonin synthesis in the brain due to decreased competition for tryptophan, the precursor to serotonin. Increased tryptophan intake (choice B) can further exacerbate serotonin syndrome. Therefore, the most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition is a combination of decreased carbohydrate intake (choice A) and increased tryptophan intake. Surreptitious opiate abuse (choice D) is less likely given the patient's history and presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
