    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, she is presenting with urinary retention. This is supported by her history of difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and a distended urinary bladder on examination. The next step in managing this patient is to relieve the urinary retention by bladder catheterization (choice B). This will help empty the bladder and provide immediate relief of symptoms. Installing a vaginal pessary (choice A) is not appropriate in this case as it is used for the management of pelvic organ prolapse, which is not the primary issue here. Cystostomy (choice C) is a more invasive procedure and is typically reserved for cases where bladder catheterization is not possible or unsuccessful. Prescribing prostaglandin E2 (choice D) is not indicated in this case as it is used for cervical ripening and induction of labor, which is not relevant to the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
