    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study. This suggests that the editor found an issue with the study design or methodology that is more aligned with a case series rather than a cohort study. To determine the specific reason, we need to analyze the given information. The study included 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the femur. The authors thoroughly recorded and analyzed parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in the patients included in the study. Based on this information, it is clear that the study had a low number of patients (only 14), which may have been the reason why the editor suggested submitting it as a case series instead of a cohort study.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
