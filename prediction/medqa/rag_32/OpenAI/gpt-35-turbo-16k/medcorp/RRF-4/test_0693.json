    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history of recurrent episodes of chest pain that wake her from sleep and also occur at random times during the day, the most likely diagnosis is angina. Angina is characterized by episodes of chest pain or discomfort that occur when the heart muscle does not receive enough blood and oxygen. The pain is typically described as a squeezing or pressure-like sensation and may radiate to the left arm, jaw, or back. The pain is usually relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that she has no contraindications, nitroglycerin (isordil) would be an appropriate choice to reduce her symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Isosorbide dinitrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
