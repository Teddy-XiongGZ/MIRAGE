    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p-value of 0.052 indicates the probability of observing a difference as extreme as the one observed, or more extreme, if there were truly no difference between the two groups. A p-value of 0.052 is greater than the conventional threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference between the two groups. The correct interpretation of this p-value is that there is a 94.8% chance that the difference observed reflects a real difference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
