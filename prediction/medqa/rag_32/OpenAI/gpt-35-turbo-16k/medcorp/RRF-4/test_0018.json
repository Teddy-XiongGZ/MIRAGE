    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute pericarditis. The sharp, severe chest pain that worsens with lying down and improves with leaning forward is a classic symptom of pericarditis. The scratching sound heard on auscultation, known as a pericardial friction rub, is another characteristic finding. The ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevations, which is also consistent with pericarditis. The optimal therapy for acute pericarditis is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, along with colchicine to reduce inflammation and prevent recurrences. Indomethacin is an NSAID that can be used, but ibuprofen is more commonly used. Omeprazole may be added to prevent gastrointestinal side effects from the NSAIDs. Pericardiocentesis is not indicated in the absence of cardiac tamponade or purulent pericarditis. Pericardiectomy is a surgical procedure that is reserved for cases of chronic or recurrent pericarditis that do not respond to medical therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
