    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 11-year-old child with leg pain while playing. The blood pressure in the upper limb is higher than in the lower limbs, indicating a brachiofemoral delay. This finding suggests a possible coarctation of the aorta. Auscultation reveals a loud S1, loud S2, and S4, which are consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy. The presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area and notching of the ribs on chest X-ray further support the diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is B. Coarctation of the aorta.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
