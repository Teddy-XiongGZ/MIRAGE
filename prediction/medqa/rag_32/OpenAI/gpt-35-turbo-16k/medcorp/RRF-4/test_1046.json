    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, we need to calculate the z-score and then find the corresponding probability using the standard normal distribution. The z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean from the value of interest (18 g/dL) and dividing by the standard error. The formula is (18 - 17) / 0.1 = 10. The z-score of 10 is extremely high, indicating that the value of 18 g/dL is significantly above the mean. Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, we can estimate the probability by looking at the area under the curve to the right of the z-score. A z-score of 10 corresponds to an extremely small probability, close to 0. Therefore, the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL is very low, and the closest answer choice is D. 99%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
