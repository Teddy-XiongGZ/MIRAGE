    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the mechanism of action of omeprazole. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that works by irreversibly inhibiting the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cells. This enzyme system is responsible for the final step in the production of gastric acid, so by inhibiting it, omeprazole reduces the production of gastric acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
