    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of somnolence, ataxia, and nystagmus are consistent with a drug overdose, likely due to the ingestion of his grandson's seizure medication. The most likely medication involved is a barbiturate or benzodiazepine, which are both highly protein-bound drugs. In cases of drug overdose, enhancing the elimination of the drug can be beneficial. One way to enhance elimination is by increasing urinary excretion. To increase urinary excretion of a highly protein-bound drug, the urine pH can be manipulated. Alkaline urine (pH > 7.5) can increase the ionization of the drug, reducing its protein binding and promoting its excretion. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment to improve urinary excretion of the substance responsible for the symptoms is sodium bicarbonate, which can alkalinize the urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
