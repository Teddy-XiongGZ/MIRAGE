    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 2-month history of multiple episodes of small amounts of blood in his stools, pale conjunctivae, and laboratory findings consistent with anemia (low hemoglobin and low mean corpuscular volume). Colonoscopy reveals a 2.3-cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a colonic adenoma. The pathogenesis of colonic adenomas involves abnormal activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which leads to impaired degradation of \u03b2-catenin. This abnormal activation is typically caused by mutations in the APC gene or \u03b2-catenin gene. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Impaired degradation of \u03b2-catenin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
