    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is being treated with low-dose prednisone for poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Long-term use of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. The most common fractures associated with long-term corticosteroid use are vertebral fractures and fractures of the hip and proximal femur. Therefore, the patient will be at an elevated risk for developing femoral neck fracture (Choice A) or femoral shaft fracture (Choice B). Osgood-Schlatter disease (Choice C) is a condition that affects the tibial tubercle in adolescents and is not related to corticosteroid use. Proximal phalanx fracture (Choice D) is not specifically associated with corticosteroid use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
