    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 63-year-old woman with fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and ankle swelling. On examination, she has bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema. The widely split S2 that varies with respiration and right bundle branch block on ECG suggest right ventricular dysfunction. The most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema in this case is increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, which is commonly seen in right-sided heart failure. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the dependent extremities, causing edema.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
