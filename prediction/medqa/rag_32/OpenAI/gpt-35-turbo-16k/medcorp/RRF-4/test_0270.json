    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, along with the MRI findings showing lesions in the brainstem and cerebellum, the most likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis. This finding is consistent with the immune-mediated inflammation seen in MS. The presence of 14-3-3 protein is more commonly associated with prion diseases. Decreased glucose with neutrophilic predominance is seen in bacterial meningitis. Decreased IgG CSF concentration is not a characteristic finding in MS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
