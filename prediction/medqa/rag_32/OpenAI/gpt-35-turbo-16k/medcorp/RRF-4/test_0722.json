    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 20-day-old child presents with lethargy, easy bruising, and petechiae. The mother reports decreased feeding. The vital signs show low blood pressure. These findings are consistent with bleeding and suggest a bleeding disorder. The most likely cause of bleeding in a newborn is vitamin K deficiency, as newborns have low levels of vitamin K and are unable to synthesize it in adequate amounts. Vitamin K is necessary for the production of clotting factors, and its deficiency can lead to bleeding. Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection, hepatitis B infection, and thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency are less likely to cause these symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
