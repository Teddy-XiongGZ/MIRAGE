    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of avoiding certain situations even after her urinary symptoms have been successfully treated suggest the presence of a specific phobia. A specific phobia is characterized by a marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation, and the avoidance of that object or situation. The fear or anxiety must be excessive or unreasonable, and the avoidance must interfere significantly with the person's daily life. The symptoms must persist for at least 6 months. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because multiple fear or avoidance situations are typically required to meet the criteria for specific phobia. Option D is correct because patients with specific phobia may also have accompanying social phobia. Option A is incorrect because the patient's avoidance behavior is not related to a fear of not being able to escape, but rather to a fear of certain situations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
