    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in Hemophilus influenzae type B. The noninfectious isolate is cultivated with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. This suggests that genetic material from the infectious isolate has been transferred to the noninfectious isolate, leading to the acquisition of virulence factors. This process is known as transformation, where bacteria take up free DNA from the environment and incorporate it into their own genome. Therefore, the most likely process responsible for the described findings is C. Transformation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
