    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine, along with a history of Crohn disease and urinary tract infections. Examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness, and urinalysis reveals RBCs and envelope-shaped crystals. The CT scan shows stones in the proximal right ureter and left kidney. Given the patient's history of Crohn disease and small bowel resection, malabsorption of fatty acids is a possible contributing factor. However, the presence of envelope-shaped crystals suggests the presence of ammonium acid urate stones, which are associated with high urine pH. Therefore, the most likely factor contributing to the patient's current condition is high urine pH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
