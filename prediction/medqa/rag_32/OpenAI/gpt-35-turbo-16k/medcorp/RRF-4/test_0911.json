The drug of choice for this patient would be bupropion, which is an antidepressant that is also used for smoking cessation. Bupropion is known to have side effects, including tachycardia (increased heart rate) and QTc prolongation (prolongation of the QT interval on an ECG), but it does not cause hypotension or urinary retention. Therefore, the patient should be counseled about the possible side effects of tachycardia and QTc prolongation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Tachycardia\"}"
