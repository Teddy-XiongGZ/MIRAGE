    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator hypothesizes that the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration is the reason for minimal healing in the group with cartilaginous injury. Therefore, the most likely tissue transplant that would promote healing in this group is a tissue that contains progenitor cells. Perichondrium is a tissue that surrounds cartilage and contains chondroprogenitor cells, which have the potential to differentiate into chondrocytes and contribute to cartilage repair. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Perichondrium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
