    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and examination findings, as well as the X-ray findings of anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity, the most likely diagnosis is Osgood-Schlatter disease. Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common cause of knee pain in adolescents, especially those involved in sports that require repetitive use of the quadriceps muscles. It is characterized by inflammation and fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity, which is the insertion site of the patellar tendon. The pain is typically exacerbated by activities that involve running, jumping, and direct knee trauma. Treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease is usually conservative and includes rest, activity modification, physical therapy, and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this case, the most appropriate next step would be to administer oral ketorolac (choice A) to help alleviate the patient's pain and inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
