    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-year-old boy with a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. The patient is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. Based on the clinical presentation, the most likely congenital condition that would explain his symptoms is pancreas divisum. Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly in which the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts fail to fuse during embryonic development, resulting in inadequate drainage of pancreatic secretions. This can lead to recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, especially in the epigastrium, as well as radiating pain to the back. Nausea can also be present. The absence of abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness on physical examination makes other conditions such as hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, biliary cyst, and intestinal malrotation less likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
