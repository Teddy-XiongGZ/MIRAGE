    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been diagnosed with celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten. The most appropriate recommendation for temporary control of severe diarrhea and bloating in celiac disease is to strictly adhere to a gluten-free diet. This means avoiding all foods and products that contain gluten, including wheat, barley, and rye. Dairy products and soy products do not contain gluten and are not the cause of the symptoms in celiac disease. Diphenoxylate is an antidiarrheal medication that may provide temporary relief, but it does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that may be used in certain cases of celiac disease, but it is not the first-line treatment for temporary control of severe diarrhea and bloating.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
