    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a cleft palate and a systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space, which are characteristic findings of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The chest radiograph shows a boot-shaped heart, which is also a characteristic finding of TOF. The echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis of TOF with pulmonary stenosis, hypertrophic right ventricular wall, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta. Given these findings, the expected additional feature in this patient is a catlike cry, which is associated with a chromosomal abnormality called Cri-du-chat syndrome. Seizures due to hypocalcemia, hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies, and increased phenylalanine in the blood are not typically associated with TOF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
