    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed after exposure to sunlight. This suggests a phototoxic reaction. The most likely cause of this reaction is the accumulation of porphobilinogen, which occurs in porphyria. Porphyria is a group of disorders characterized by defects in heme synthesis, leading to the accumulation of porphyrins and porphobilinogen.
