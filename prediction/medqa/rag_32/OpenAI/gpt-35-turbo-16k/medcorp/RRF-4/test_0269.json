    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the clinical presentation of a deep corneal ulcer, severe conjunctival injection, and purulent discharge in a patient wearing soft contact lenses, the most likely causative organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen associated with contact lens-related keratitis and can cause severe corneal ulcers. It is known for its ability to produce a greenish-blue pigment and has a characteristic fruity odor. Other gram-negative bacilli, such as Enterobacteriaceae, are less commonly associated with contact lens-related keratitis. Gram-negative, non-maltose fermenting diplococci (Neisseria species) are associated with gonococcal conjunctivitis, which typically presents with purulent discharge but not corneal ulceration. Gram-positive, optochin-sensitive diplococci (Streptococcus pneumoniae) are associated with bacterial conjunctivitis but are less likely to cause corneal ulcers. Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacilli (Escherichia coli) are not commonly associated with contact lens-related keratitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
