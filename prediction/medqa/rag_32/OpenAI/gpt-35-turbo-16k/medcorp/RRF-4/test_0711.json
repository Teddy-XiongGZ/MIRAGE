    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-year-old boy with excessively dry skin since he was 6 months old. The dry, scaly skin is worse in winter and better in summer. Examination reveals generalized fine scales with coarse skin all over the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae. There are also multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is ichthyosis vulgaris. Psoriasis typically presents with scaly plaques that are not limited to skin creases. Lichen simplex is characterized by thickened, leathery skin due to chronic scratching or rubbing. Pityriasis versicolor presents with hypo- or hyperpigmented macules on the trunk and extremities, but does not cause excessively dry skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Ichthyosis vulgaris.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
