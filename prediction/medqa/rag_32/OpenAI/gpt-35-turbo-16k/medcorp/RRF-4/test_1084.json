    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described (noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of lips, intermittent respiratory distress), the most likely diagnosis is tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) with esophageal atresia. TEF is a congenital abnormality where there is an abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus. This can lead to the passage of air into the stomach, causing gastric distension and subsequent respiratory distress. The inability to pass a gastric catheter through the mouth (option C) is consistent with TEF. The other options (A, B, D) are not consistent with the symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
