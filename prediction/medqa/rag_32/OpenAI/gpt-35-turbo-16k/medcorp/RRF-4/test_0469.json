    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The x-ray of the chest shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. These findings are consistent with sarcoidosis, which is characterized by non-caseating granulomas and can present with respiratory symptoms, eye involvement, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary tuberculosis typically presents with cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Hodgkin's lymphoma may present with lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, and weight loss, but it is less likely in this case as there is no palpable lymphadenopathy. Histoplasmosis may present with respiratory symptoms, but it is less likely in this case as the patient's travel history is not consistent with exposure to endemic areas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
