    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The number needed to treat (NNT) is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). ARR is calculated by subtracting the control event rate (CER) from the experimental event rate (EER). In this case, the EER is 190/250 and the CER is 165/250. Therefore, the ARR is (190/250) - (165/250) = 0.76 - 0.66 = 0.1. Taking the reciprocal of the ARR, the NNT is 1/0.1 = 10. So, the correct calculation for the NNT is 10.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
