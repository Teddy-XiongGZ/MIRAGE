    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the description of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is tinea cruris. Tinea cruris, also known as jock itch, is a fungal infection that commonly affects the groin and inner thighs. It presents as an erythematous, well-demarcated patch with pruritus. The scrotum is typically spared. The patient's participation in wrestling may increase his risk of developing tinea cruris due to close skin-to-skin contact and sweating. The other options, tinea corporis, candidal balanitis, and tinea unguium, do not match the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
