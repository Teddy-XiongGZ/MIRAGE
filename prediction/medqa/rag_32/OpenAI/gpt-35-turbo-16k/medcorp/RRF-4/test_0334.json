    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Patients with diabetes are recommended to undergo various health screenings and vaccinations. To determine the recommended measures, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [13] states that patients with dual diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension have a high risk of cardiovascular mortality, and asymptomatic patients with hypertension should be screened for type 2 diabetes. Document [27] mentions that screening for diabetes with the aid of a 50 g oral dose of glucose to detect gestational diabetes is a must during pregnancy. Document [31] suggests that random blood glucose testing of people consulting in primary care, and at high risk of diabetes, followed by annual monitoring, will detect approximately 60% of cases of hitherto undetected diabetes. None of the documents mention urinalysis every 6 months or weekly foot inspections by the patient or family member as recommended measures for patients with diabetes. However, document [13] mentions that a comprehensive foot exam every year is recommended. Regarding vaccinations, none of the documents specifically mention the meningococcal vaccine as recommended for patients with diabetes. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Comprehensive foot exam every year.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
