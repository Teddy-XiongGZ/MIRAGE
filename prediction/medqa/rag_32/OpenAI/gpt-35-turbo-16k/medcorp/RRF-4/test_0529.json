    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye, which is a key feature of acute vision loss. The presence of a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula suggests a diagnosis of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). This is further supported by the absence of direct pupillary reflex in the right eye. Retinal detachment typically presents with floaters, flashes of light, and a curtain-like visual field defect. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by severe eye pain, headache, and a mid-dilated, nonreactive pupil. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) typically presents with sudden, painless vision loss, but it is more commonly associated with optic disc swelling and a pale, swollen optic disc. Given the clinical presentation and findings, CRAO is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
