    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protein-secreting cells are involved in the production and release of proteins. The ribosomes responsible for synthesizing these proteins are typically located on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER). The rough ER is connected to the nucleus and shares the same membrane, allowing for efficient transport of synthesized ribosomes for protein translation. Therefore, the essential ribosome location for protein-secreting cells is the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
