    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with chest pain and signs of cardiogenic shock, indicating a severe cardiac event. The electrocardiogram shows ST elevations in multiple leads, suggesting acute myocardial infarction. To improve the hemodynamic status of the patient, a medication that primarily stimulates the beta-1 adrenergic receptor would be most appropriate. Activation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor increases heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output, which can help improve blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
