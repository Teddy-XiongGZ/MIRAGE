    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe menstrual cramping and heavy periods. She has a history of irregular periods and a family history of endometriosis and heavy periods. The first step in evaluating this patient is to consider the possibility of endometriosis, which can cause severe menstrual cramps and heavy bleeding. Pelvic ultrasound is the best next step to evaluate for endometriosis. MRI of the pelvis is not necessary at this point. NSAIDs can be used for pain relief, but they do not address the underlying cause. Increased exercise may help with overall menstrual health, but it is not the best next step for this patient's severe symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
