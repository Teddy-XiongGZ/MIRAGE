    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To detect the genetic material of HIV in the child, the hospital would use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. PCR is a molecular technique that amplifies and detects the viral DNA or RNA. This assay is highly sensitive and can detect HIV infection in infants at an early age, even before the development of detectable antibodies. ELISA and rapid HIV antibody tests are used to detect HIV antibodies in the blood, which may not be present in infants born to HIV-positive mothers due to the presence of maternal antibodies. Southern blot is a technique used for DNA analysis and is not commonly used for HIV diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
