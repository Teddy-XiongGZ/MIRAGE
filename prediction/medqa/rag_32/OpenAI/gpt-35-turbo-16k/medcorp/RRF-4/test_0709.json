    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, we can look for relevant information in the documents to determine the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea along the proximal convoluted tubule. We can start by searching for information on urea concentration in the tubular fluid and plasma in the relevant documents. Once we find this information, we can compare the concentrations to determine the ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
