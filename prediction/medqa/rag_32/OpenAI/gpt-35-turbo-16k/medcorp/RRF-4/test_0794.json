    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath and fatigue, which are suggestive of a cardiac etiology. The weak peripheral pulses and the cardiac examination findings are important clues. Tricuspid valve stenosis is unlikely as it typically presents with symptoms of right heart failure, such as peripheral edema. Mitral valve prolapse is also unlikely as it is usually asymptomatic or presents with atypical chest pain. Mitral valve stenosis is a possibility, but the weak peripheral pulses suggest a different diagnosis. Aortic valve stenosis is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and risk factors (age, smoking history).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
