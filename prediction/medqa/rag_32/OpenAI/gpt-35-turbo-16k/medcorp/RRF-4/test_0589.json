    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden-onset severe right flank pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary, with detectable flow in the right ovarian artery but no flow in the right ovarian vein. This presentation is consistent with ovarian torsion. In ovarian torsion, the ovary rotates around both the infundibulopelvic ligament (also known as the suspensory ligament) and the utero-ovarian ligament (also known as the ovarian ligament), disrupting blood flow to the ovary. Therefore, the most likely ligament involved in this case is the infundibulopelvic ligament (D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
