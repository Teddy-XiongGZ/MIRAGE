    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of excruciating chest pain that is ripping and radiating to the back, along with his significant medical history of a heart murmur and joint hypermobility, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition characterized by a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, leading to separation of the layers and potential rupture. The classic presentation includes severe chest pain that is described as tearing or ripping and may radiate to the back. The patient's vital signs are consistent with hypotension, which can occur in aortic dissection due to decreased blood flow to vital organs. Given the patient's joint hypermobility, a possible underlying connective tissue disorder such as Marfan syndrome should be considered. The most likely finding on physical examination in this patient is a systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space, which may indicate aortic regurgitation due to aortic root dilation in Marfan syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
