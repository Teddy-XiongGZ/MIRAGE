    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision. The diplopia is more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze. The examination of extraocular movements shows limited abduction of the left eye. These findings suggest a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which is responsible for coordinating eye movements. The MLF connects the oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain to the abducens nucleus in the pons, allowing for coordinated eye movements. Lesions in the MLF can result in internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is characterized by impaired adduction of the ipsilateral eye and nystagmus of the contralateral eye during lateral gaze. The most likely location of the lesion in this patient is the MLF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
