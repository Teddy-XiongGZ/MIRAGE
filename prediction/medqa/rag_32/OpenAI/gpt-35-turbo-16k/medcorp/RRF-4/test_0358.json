    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is radial head subluxation, also known as nursemaid's elbow. This is a common injury in young children and is often caused by a sudden pull on the extended pronated arm. The patient's refusal to use the affected limb, pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, and limited supination are consistent with this diagnosis. The next step in management is reduction of the radial head subluxation. The preferred reduction maneuver is hyperpronation, which has a higher success rate and is less painful than a supination maneuver. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Moderate flexion then hyperpronation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
