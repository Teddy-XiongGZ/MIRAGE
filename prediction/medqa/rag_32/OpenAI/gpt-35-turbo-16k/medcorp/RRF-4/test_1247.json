    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the total volume of gas in the patient's airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange, we need to calculate the anatomical dead space. Anatomical dead space is the volume of gas in the conducting airways that does not participate in gas exchange. It is equal to the sum of the upper airway volume and the conducting airway volume. In this case, the upper airway volume is 100 mL and the conducting airway volume is 125 mL, so the anatomical dead space is 225 mL. The total volume of gas in the airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange is equal to the anatomical dead space plus the residual volume. In this case, the residual volume is 1,000 mL. Therefore, the total volume of gas in the airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange is 225 mL + 1,000 mL = 1,225 mL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 1200 mL\"}"
