    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of diabetes and osteoarthritis who presents with blurry vision. Fundoscopic examination reveals narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms. These findings are consistent with diabetic retinopathy, a complication of long-standing diabetes. In diabetic retinopathy, tissue-specific differences in enzyme expression contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. The enzyme involved in the development of diabetic retinopathy is sorbitol dehydrogenase, which converts glucose to sorbitol. In diabetes, increased glucose levels lead to increased sorbitol production, which can accumulate in the retina and cause osmotic damage, leading to retinal vascular changes and microaneurysms. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Sorbitol dehydrogenase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
