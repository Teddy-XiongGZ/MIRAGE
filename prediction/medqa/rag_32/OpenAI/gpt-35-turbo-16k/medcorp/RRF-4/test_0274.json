    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 67-year-old white man with a rapidly developing pink bump on his forehead. He has a history of significant sun exposure. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug. The excisional biopsy shows an exophytic nodule with central invagination and minimal keratinocyte atypia. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is keratoacanthoma. Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule with a central keratin plug. It is commonly seen in sun-exposed areas and is associated with significant sun exposure. It is usually benign and rarely metastasizes. Basal cell carcinoma is another common skin cancer that can present with a similar appearance, but it typically has more aggressive features such as infiltrating growth and ulceration. Seborrheic keratosis is a benign skin lesion that is typically raised and has a stuck-on appearance. Kaposi's sarcoma is a vascular tumor that is typically associated with immunosuppression and presents as purplish nodules or plaques. Given the patient's history of sun exposure and the characteristic appearance of the lesion, keratoacanthoma is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
