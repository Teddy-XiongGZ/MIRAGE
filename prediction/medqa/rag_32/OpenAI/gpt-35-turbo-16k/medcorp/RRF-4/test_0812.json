    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 45-year-old African-American woman with a nonproductive cough, fatigue, weight loss, and an abnormal chest x-ray showing a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the left lung. She has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis, and she drinks alcohol but does not smoke. The most likely diagnosis in this case is squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Squamous cell carcinoma is strongly associated with smoking, but it can also occur in non-smokers. It commonly presents with cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, and a central lung mass or hilar enlargement on imaging. Carcinoid tumors typically present with flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing. Sarcoidosis is characterized by bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infiltrates. Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common type of lung cancer and is associated with peripheral lung nodules and pleural effusions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
