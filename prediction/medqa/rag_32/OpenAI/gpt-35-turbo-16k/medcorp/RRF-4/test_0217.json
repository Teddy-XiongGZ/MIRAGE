    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain at 12 weeks' gestation. The ultrasound shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity, indicating a missed abortion. The most appropriate next step in management is dilation and curettage (C) to remove the nonviable pregnancy and prevent complications such as infection or excessive bleeding. Misoprostol therapy (A) and methotrexate therapy (B) are options for medical management of early pregnancy loss, but they are not the first-line choice in this case because the patient is experiencing symptoms and is at a later gestational age. Complete bed rest (D) is not indicated as it does not affect the outcome of a missed abortion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
