    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with peritonsillar abscess, which is a complication of tonsillitis. The most appropriate next step in management is needle aspiration and oral clindamycin therapy. Needle aspiration is the preferred initial treatment for peritonsillar abscess, as it allows for drainage of the abscess and relief of symptoms. Clindamycin is the antibiotic of choice for peritonsillar abscess due to its anaerobic coverage. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy is not indicated as the initial treatment for peritonsillar abscess. Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy is a more invasive option and is typically reserved for cases that do not respond to needle aspiration. Intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy alone is not sufficient for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
