    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration, which are suggestive of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. This is a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Treatment with protein C concentrate is the most appropriate option as it can help reverse the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and prevent further tissue necrosis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be beneficial in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor and is not indicated in this case. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent and is not indicated in the treatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
