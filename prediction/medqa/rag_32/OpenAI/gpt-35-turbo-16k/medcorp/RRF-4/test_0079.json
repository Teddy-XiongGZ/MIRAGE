    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a penetrating wound to the chest and is in shock with profuse bleeding. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. The best definitive surgical approach in this patient would be to repair the injury with interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets (Choice C). Immediate cardiac transplant (Choice A) is not indicated in this case as the patient is stable enough for surgical repair. Watchful waiting (Choice B) is not appropriate as the patient is in shock and requires immediate intervention. Needle thoracostomy (Choice D) is not the best approach for repairing a penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
