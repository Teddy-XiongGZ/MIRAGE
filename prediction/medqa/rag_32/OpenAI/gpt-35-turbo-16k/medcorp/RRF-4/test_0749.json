    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a severe headache, jaw pain worsened by chewing, and tenderness over the scalp, jaw, and temporal area. These symptoms are suggestive of temporal arteritis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the temporal arteries. Temporal arteritis is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications such as vision loss. The best next step in management is to perform a temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. However, this option is not listed among the answer choices. Among the given options, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate treatment with IV steroids (choice C) to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. CT head (choice A) may be considered to rule out other causes of headache, but it is not the most urgent step in this case. Ibuprofen (choice B) may provide symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying inflammation. Lumbar puncture (choice D) is not indicated in this case as there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the best next step in management is IV steroids (choice C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
