The absent thymic shadow on chest X-ray suggests a diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The most likely definitive treatment for SCID is hematopoietic cell transplantation (choice A), which can provide the patient with a functioning immune system.

Thymic transplantation (choice D) is not a standard treatment for SCID.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
