    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p-value represents the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta in women with prior cesarean birth, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true. In this case, the p-value is 0.03, which means that there is a 3% chance of observing the reported association (or a more extreme association) if the null hypothesis (no association) is true. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the p-value represents the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta in women with prior cesarean birth, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
