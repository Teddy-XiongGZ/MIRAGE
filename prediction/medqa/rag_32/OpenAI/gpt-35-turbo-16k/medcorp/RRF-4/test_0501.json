    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed fever, pain, and purulent discharge from the wound after surgery, indicating a post-operative infection. The wound culture showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a staphylococcal infection. The patient was initially treated with dicloxacillin, a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic commonly used to treat staphylococcal infections.
