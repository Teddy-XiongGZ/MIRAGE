    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a metabolic acidosis (low HCO3-) and a normal anion gap. The low HCO3- suggests a primary metabolic acidosis. The urine pH is 7.0, indicating that the kidneys are not appropriately excreting acid. The low serum potassium (3.2 mEq/L) suggests that the patient may be taking a potassium-wasting diuretic. Among the options, the most likely drug to cause these findings is eplerenone, which is a potassium-sparing diuretic. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Eplerenone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
