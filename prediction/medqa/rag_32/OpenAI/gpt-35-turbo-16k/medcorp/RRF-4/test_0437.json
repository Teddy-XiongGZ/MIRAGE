    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a firm, nontender mass in her left breast. Mammography shows an irregular calcified mass. A core needle biopsy confirms invasive ductal carcinoma. Genetic analysis of breast cancer cells is commonly done to determine the expression of specific genes that may guide treatment decisions. In this case, the most likely gene to be overexpressed in invasive ductal carcinoma is HER2 (A). HER2 overexpression is seen in approximately 20% of breast cancers and is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. BCR-ABL (B) is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, not breast cancer. BRCA-2 (C) is a gene associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, but its overexpression is not typically seen in sporadic breast cancer. BCL-2 (D) is a gene involved in apoptosis regulation and is not typically overexpressed in breast cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
