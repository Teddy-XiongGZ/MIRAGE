    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise, which suggests a cardiac etiology. The cardiac examination reveals wide splitting of S2, with the second component of S2 being loud and best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space. This is consistent with an abnormality in the pulmonary valve. The most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings is increased right ventricular afterload, which can lead to delayed closure of the pulmonary valve and wide splitting of S2. This can be seen in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary stenosis. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased right ventricular afterload.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
