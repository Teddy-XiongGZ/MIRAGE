    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the factor by which resistance to blood flow has increased in the left circumflex artery with the occlusion, we need to compare it to a vessel with no occlusion. According to the relevant documents, resistance of the blood vessels can be caused by narrowing of the blood vessels. The blood flow is proportional to the radius of the artery to the fourth power. Therefore, if the diameter of the left circumflex artery is reduced by 50%, the radius is reduced by 50% as well. The resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the radius to the fourth power. So, if the radius is reduced by 50%, the resistance is increased by (1/0.5)^4 = 16.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
