    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient has a 1-week history of diarrhea and abdominal bloating, along with bulky, foul-smelling stools that are difficult to flush. He also has recurrent dull epigastric pain triggered by meals and drinks 6 to 8 beers daily. The CT scan of the abdomen shows a structure indicated by the arrows. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic pancreatitis. In chronic pancreatitis, the pancreatic duct can become dilated and filled with inspissated secretions, leading to the formation of pseudocysts. These pseudocysts are lined by granulation tissue, which is a fibrous tissue that forms during the healing process. Therefore, the structure indicated by the arrows is most likely lined by granulation tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
