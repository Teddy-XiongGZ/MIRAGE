    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections and bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. The voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. These findings are suggestive of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is the abnormal flow of urine from the bladder back into the ureters and potentially the kidneys. VUR can lead to urinary tract infections and renal damage. Given the history of recurrent urinary tract infections and the presence of VUR, the most likely finding on histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen would be cortical thinning with tubular atrophy (choice C). This is because chronic VUR can lead to renal scarring and loss of renal tissue, resulting in cortical thinning and tubular atrophy. Glomerular crescents with macrophages (choice A) and matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation (choice B) are findings seen in glomerulonephritis, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Thickened glomerular capillary loops (choice D) is a finding seen in conditions such as membranous nephropathy or diabetic nephropathy, which are not likely in this pediatric patient with recurrent urinary tract infections and VUR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
