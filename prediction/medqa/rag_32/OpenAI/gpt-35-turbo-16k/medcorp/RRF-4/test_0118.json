He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. On examination, he has a mildly prolonged expiratory phase. The pulmonary function test shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of predicted value, indicating airflow obstruction. The lung volumes show an increased total lung capacity and residual volume, suggesting air trapping. The DLCO is decreased, indicating impaired gas exchange. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
