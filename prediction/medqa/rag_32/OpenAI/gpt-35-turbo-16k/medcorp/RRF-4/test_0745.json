    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient complains of feeling lightheaded after hemodialysis sessions, which suggests that her blood pressure may be dropping too low. The blood pressure measurements before and after dialysis support this, as her blood pressure is lower after dialysis. To reduce the likelihood of falls, the most appropriate management would be to increase ultrafiltration during dialysis. This would help remove excess fluid from the body and potentially prevent post-dialysis hypotension and lightheadedness. Cooling the dialysate, eating heavier meals, and steroid administration are not indicated for this patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
