    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the ejection fraction, we need to know the stroke volume and end-diastolic volume. The end-systolic volume is given as 80 mL. The ejection fraction is calculated by dividing the stroke volume by the end-diastolic volume and multiplying by 100. However, the end-diastolic volume is not provided in the question. Therefore, we cannot determine the ejection fraction based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
