    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the case of damage to the alveoli, the regeneration of the alveolar lining involves the proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells. These cells play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and function of the alveoli by producing surfactant, which reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse. The proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells helps to restore the normal structure and function of the alveoli after damage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
