    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 28-year-old female with episodic chest pain that is described as squeezing and tightness. The pain occurs every few days and is not associated with food or exercise. The patient is able to climb stairs without issue. She has no known family history. On examination, her vital signs are normal and EKG is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. Based on this information, the mechanism of the patient's chest pain is most similar to variant angina, also known as Prinzmetal's angina. Variant angina is characterized by transient coronary artery spasm, which can cause episodic chest pain and transient ST elevations on EKG. This is different from stable angina, which is typically associated with exertion and relieved by rest. Therefore, the correct answer is not B (myocardial infarction) or D (costochondritis). Raynaud's phenomenon is a vasospastic disorder that primarily affects the fingers and toes, not the coronary arteries, so it is not the best answer. Aortic dissection is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, which can cause severe chest pain that is often described as tearing or ripping. However, the patient's symptoms and EKG findings are not consistent with aortic dissection. Therefore, the best answer is A. Raynaud's phenomenon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
