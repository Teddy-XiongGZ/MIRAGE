    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient reports experiencing both episodes of depressed mood and episodes of elevated mood, which suggests a mood disorder. The episodes of depressed mood last for a few weeks and do not coincide with any specific life events, which is consistent with persistent depressive disorder. However, the patient also experiences episodes of elevated mood, which is more indicative of bipolar disorder. The presence of both depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes supports a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient's history of occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is Bipolar I disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
