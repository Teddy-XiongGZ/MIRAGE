    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn presents with increasing yellowing of the eyes and skin, pale stools, and elevated bilirubin levels. The elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels suggest a cholestatic pattern of jaundice. The most likely diagnosis in this case is biliary atresia, which is a progressive fibro-obliterative disorder of the extrahepatic biliary tree that presents with jaundice and acholic stools in the first few weeks of life. Galactosemia is unlikely because the patient was breastfed initially and the symptoms did not improve after switching to formula feeds. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is unlikely because the patient has elevated direct bilirubin levels. Breast milk jaundice is unlikely because the symptoms started before the switch to formula feeds. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is biliary atresia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
