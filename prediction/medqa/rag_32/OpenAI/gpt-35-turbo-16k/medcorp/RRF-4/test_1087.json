    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of increasing shortness of breath while exercising, along with the presence of a harsh systolic ejection murmur and closely spaced pulses on palpation of the carotid artery, are consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is characterized by asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, which can cause obstruction of the outflow tract and lead to symptoms such as dyspnea and syncope. The harsh systolic ejection murmur is caused by turbulent blood flow through the narrowed outflow tract. The closely spaced pulses, known as pulsus bisferiens, are a characteristic finding in HCM. Aortic stenosis can also cause a harsh systolic ejection murmur, but it typically does not cause pulsus bisferiens. Cardiac tamponade would present with signs of hemodynamic compromise, such as hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressure, which are not described in the case. Third-degree heart block would present with bradycardia and a regular rhythm, which is not consistent with the patient's findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\"}"
