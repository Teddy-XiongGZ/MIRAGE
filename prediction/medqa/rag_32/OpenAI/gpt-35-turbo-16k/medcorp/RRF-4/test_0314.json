    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing symptoms of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes, which are characteristic of allergic rhinitis. The medication prescribed to alleviate her symptoms is likely targeting the underlying allergic response. Option A, alpha-adrenergic agonist, is not commonly used for allergic rhinitis. Option B, competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors, is more commonly used for conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Option C, disruption of disulfide bonds, is not relevant to allergic rhinitis. Option D, short-acting beta-2 agonist, is commonly used to relieve symptoms of bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma, but it is not the first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis. Therefore, the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question is B, competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
