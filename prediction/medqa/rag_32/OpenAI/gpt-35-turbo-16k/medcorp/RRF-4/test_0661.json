    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old girl with sweating and respiratory distress while eating, which suggests a possible cardiac abnormality affecting her ability to tolerate increased cardiac output during feeding. The echocardiography findings of a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction are consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSD is a common congenital heart defect characterized by a hole in the interventricular septum. The physical examination findings associated with VSD include a systolic murmur due to increased blood flow across the defect. The murmur is typically heard best at the left lower sternal border and may increase in intensity with increased cardiac output, such as with hand clenching (option A). Therefore, the answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
