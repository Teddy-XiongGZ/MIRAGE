    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of cleft lip and recurrent upper respiratory infections, as well as the absence of cardiac sounds on examination, suggests a diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome, which is characterized by primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the structure and function of cilia, including dynein arm proteins. Dynein arm proteins are part of the retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein complex that powers the movement of cilia. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
