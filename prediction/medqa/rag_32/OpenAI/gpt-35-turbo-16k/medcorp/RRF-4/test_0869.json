    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the fraction of GERD that can be prevented if alcohol is no longer consumed in the town, we need to compare the proportion of GERD cases in alcoholics to the proportion of GERD cases in non-alcoholics. In the study, out of the 200 alcoholics, 30 developed GERD, which is a proportion of 30/200 = 0.15. Out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD, which is a proportion of 30/400 = 0.075. To calculate the fraction of GERD that can be prevented, we subtract the proportion of GERD cases in non-alcoholics from the proportion of GERD cases in alcoholics: 0.15 - 0.075 = 0.075. Therefore, the fraction of GERD that can be prevented if alcohol is no longer consumed in the town is 0.075 or 7.5%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"0.075\"}"
