    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she most likely has a breast mass that is consistent with a fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are common benign breast masses that are often found in young women. They are typically round, mobile, and painless. The fact that the mass is tender and increases in size before her menses suggests that it may be hormonally responsive. The absence of any concerning features such as skin changes, nipple discharge, or axillary lymphadenopathy further supports the benign nature of the mass. Given the patient's age and the absence of any other risk factors, the most likely outcome is that this mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time, as fibroadenomas often regress spontaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
