    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At point D in the graph, there is a decrease in stomach pH and a decrease in stomach acid secretion. This suggests a decrease in gastric acid production. The most likely mechanism that contributes to this decrease is the increased activity of D cells. D cells secrete somatostatin, which inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, increased activity of D cells would lead to a decrease in gastric acid production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
