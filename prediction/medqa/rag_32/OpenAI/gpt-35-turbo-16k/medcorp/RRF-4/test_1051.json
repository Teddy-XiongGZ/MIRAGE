    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the maintenance dose, we can use the formula: Maintenance dose = (desired plasma concentration * clearance * dosing interval) / bioavailability. Given that the desired plasma concentration is 15 mg/L, the clearance is the rate at which the drug is eliminated from the body, the dosing interval is 8 hours, and the bioavailability is 50%, we can substitute these values into the formula. The clearance can be calculated using the half-life and volume of distribution: Clearance = (0.693 * volume of distribution) / half-life. Substituting the values into the formula, we can calculate the maintenance dose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
