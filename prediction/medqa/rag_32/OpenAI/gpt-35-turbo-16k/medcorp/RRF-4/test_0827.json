    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely mechanism responsible for her amenorrhea is inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. The patient has galactorrhea, which is a sign of hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia can inhibit GnRH release from the hypothalamus, leading to decreased secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. This disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis can result in amenorrhea. The patient's visual field defects and recurrent headaches suggest a pituitary adenoma, which can cause hyperprolactinemia and subsequent amenorrhea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
