    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 55-year-old man with bilateral wrist and knee pain, morning stiffness, and nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints. Ankylosing spondylitis typically presents with inflammatory back pain and stiffness, not wrist and knee pain. Gout typically presents with acute monoarticular arthritis, not bilateral wrist and knee pain. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and tender points, but does not typically present with nodules or joint swelling. Osteoarthritis is the most likely diagnosis in this patient given the chronic bilateral joint pain, morning stiffness, nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints, and crepitus on passive range of motion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
