    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn in this case is presenting with fever, jaundice, loss of flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis, which are consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels, which are indicative of hemolysis. The photomicrograph of the peripheral blood smear would likely show features of hemolysis such as schistocytes and reticulocytosis. Given that the mother is Rh+ and the newborn is showing signs of HDN, the most likely cause is maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen (option B). These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in the newborn if the mother is Rh- and sensitized to the D antigen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
