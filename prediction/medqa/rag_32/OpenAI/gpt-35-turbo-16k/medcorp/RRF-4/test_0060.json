She also has a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash on her trunk and abdomen. The most likely causal organism in this case is Salmonella typhi, which causes typhoid fever. Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, which typically presents with watery diarrhea. Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, which presents with symptoms related to the affected organ (e.g., hepatosplenomegaly in the case of S. mansoni). Clostridium perfringens is a bacterium that can cause food poisoning, but it typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea, rather than the prolonged fever and rash seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
