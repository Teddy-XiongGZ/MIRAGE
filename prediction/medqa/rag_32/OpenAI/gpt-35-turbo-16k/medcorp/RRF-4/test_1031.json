    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The elevated AFP level in this patient is highly suggestive of a yolk sac tumor, which is the most common testicular tumor in children. The presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells on biopsy is consistent with the histological features of a yolk sac tumor. The hCG level is within the normal range, making choriocarcinoma less likely. Classic seminoma is rare in children, and teratoma typically presents with a heterogeneous mass on imaging. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is D. Yolk sac tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
