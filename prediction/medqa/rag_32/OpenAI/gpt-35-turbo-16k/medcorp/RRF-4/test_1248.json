    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, intermittent fever, and non-productive cough, along with the physical examination findings of wheezing and enlarged lymph nodes, the differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and lymphoma. The CT scan of the chest shows enlarged lymph nodes, which is consistent with lymphadenopathy. The biopsy specimen of a cervical lymph node shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis, which is suggestive of sarcoidosis.
