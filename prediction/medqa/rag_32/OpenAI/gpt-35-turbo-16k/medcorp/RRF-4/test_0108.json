    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation of severe knee, hip, and groin pain, inability to bear weight on the left leg, and limited range of motion of the left hip, the most likely diagnosis is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is a self-limiting condition that affects the blood supply to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis. The initial management of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease involves supportive therapy and observation. This includes pain management, activity modification, and physical therapy to maintain range of motion. Surgical interventions such as pinning of the femoral head may be considered in certain cases, but they are not the initial management approach. Immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness is typically used for the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Casting and crutches may be used for immobilization and support, but they are not the primary management for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
