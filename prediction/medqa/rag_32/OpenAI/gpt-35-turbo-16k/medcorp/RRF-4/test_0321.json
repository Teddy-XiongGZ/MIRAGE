    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden onset breathlessness, sharp chest pain with inspiration, and pain in the right calf on dorsiflexion, which are suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is also at risk for PE due to recent knee replacement surgery and prolonged immobilization. The initial evaluation should include a lower extremity doppler to assess for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as this is a common precursor to PE. If the doppler is positive for DVT, it confirms the diagnosis of PE and the patient should be started on anticoagulation therapy. If the doppler is negative, further imaging such as a ventilation-perfusion scan can be considered to confirm the diagnosis of PE. Inferior vena cava filter placement is not indicated as the first-line management for PE. Subcutaneous fondaparinux can be considered for anticoagulation therapy once the diagnosis of PE is confirmed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
