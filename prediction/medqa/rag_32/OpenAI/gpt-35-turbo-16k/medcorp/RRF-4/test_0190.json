    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of intermittent chest discomfort, shortness of breath, shakiness, and excessive sweating, along with the associated anxiety and avoidance behaviors, the most likely diagnosis is panic disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, which are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that reach a peak within minutes. The attacks are often accompanied by physical symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, and a fear of losing control or dying. The long-term management of panic disorder typically involves the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as first-line pharmacotherapy. Therefore, the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition would be citalopram, an SSRI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
