    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing postpartum hemorrhage with a red mass protruding through the vagina. This is consistent with uterine inversion, a rare but life-threatening complication. The immediate management of uterine inversion involves manual replacement of the uterus. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to elevate the posterior fornix (Choice C) to manually replace the uterus. Hysterectomy (Choice A) may be considered if attempts to replace the uterus are unsuccessful or if there is significant uterine atony. Intravenous oxytocin (Choice B) may be used after the uterus is replaced to promote uterine contraction. Red blood cell transfusion (Choice D) may be necessary if the patient has significant blood loss and is hemodynamically unstable, but it is not the immediate next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
