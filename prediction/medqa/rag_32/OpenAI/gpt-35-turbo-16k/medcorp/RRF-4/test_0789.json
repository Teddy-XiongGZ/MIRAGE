    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with syncope and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis. This suggests a cardiac arrhythmia as the underlying cause of syncope. Among the given choices, Brugada syndrome is the most likely cause of this patient's syncope. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal sodium channel function in the heart, leading to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. It is often associated with syncope and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Hypomagnesemia, prolonged QT interval, and hyperkalemia can also cause cardiac arrhythmias, but they are less likely in this case based on the clinical presentation and history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
