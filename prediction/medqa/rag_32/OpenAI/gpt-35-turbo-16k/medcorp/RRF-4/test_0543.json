    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's presentation with sudden onset sharp chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be considered. To rule out pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient, the most reasonable first step is to perform a D-dimer test. A negative D-dimer result would effectively rule out pulmonary embolism and no further imaging would be necessary. If the D-dimer result is positive, further imaging such as a CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast would be indicated to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
