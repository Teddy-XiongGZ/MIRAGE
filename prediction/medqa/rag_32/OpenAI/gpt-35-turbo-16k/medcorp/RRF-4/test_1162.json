    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lymphatic route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain involves the lymphatic vessels draining the ovaries and pelvic region. From the sentinel node, the lymphatic drainage would typically follow the lumbar trunks to the cisterna chyli. From the cisterna chyli, the lymphatic drainage would continue through the thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein. Therefore, the most likely lymphatic route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain is: Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
