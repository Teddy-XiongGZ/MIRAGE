    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, and an MRI shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This suggests a possible obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricular system. The CSF flows from the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro). Therefore, the most likely cause of the ventricular dilation in this case is a blockade of the interventricular foramen (choice B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
