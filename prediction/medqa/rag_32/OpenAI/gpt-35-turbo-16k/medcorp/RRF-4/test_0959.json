    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 65-year-old male with stiffness in his arm and decreased range of motion of his shoulder. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and hypertension. The most likely diagnosis in this case is adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder. Adhesive capsulitis is characterized by stiffness and decreased range of motion of the shoulder joint. It is more common in patients with diabetes and can be associated with obesity. The patient's sedentary lifestyle may also contribute to the development of adhesive capsulitis. Rotator cuff impingement, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and subacromial bursitis may also cause shoulder pain and limited range of motion, but they are less likely in this case given the patient's clinical presentation and medical history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
