    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in question has features consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU), including elevated serum phenylalanine levels, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia. The elevated serum prolactin level suggests a deficiency in dopamine, which is synthesized from phenylalanine. The most likely cause of this patient's condition is a deficiency in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. Supplementation of BH4 is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
