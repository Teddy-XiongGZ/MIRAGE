    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of abnormal coagulation lab tests before an appendectomy, suggesting a possible underlying coagulation disorder. The prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) indicates a defect in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Among the options provided, Factor VIII and Factor IX are involved in the intrinsic pathway. To differentiate between the two, additional information is needed. The presence of decreased bradykinin formation suggests a defect in the contact activation system, which is primarily mediated by Factor XII. Therefore, the most likely factor defective in this patient is Factor XII (Choice D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
