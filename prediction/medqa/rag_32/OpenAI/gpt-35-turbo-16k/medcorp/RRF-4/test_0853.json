    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with a hyperthermic state, as evidenced by his high temperature, dry mucous membranes, and rigidity. The patient's exposure to high temperatures and his undressing behavior suggest heat stroke as the most likely diagnosis. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and catatonic schizophrenia can present with similar symptoms, but the patient's exposure to high temperatures and the absence of a known history of antipsychotic medication use make these less likely. Oversedation is also less likely given the patient's hyperthermia and rigidity. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is heat stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
