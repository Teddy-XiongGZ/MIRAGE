    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The researcher immunoprecipitated the CD8 protein and identified a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. This suggests that the identified protein is an MHC class I molecule, as MHC class I molecules are known to interact with CD8. MHC class I molecules bind endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel. Therefore, the primary function of the identified protein is most likely to bind endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
