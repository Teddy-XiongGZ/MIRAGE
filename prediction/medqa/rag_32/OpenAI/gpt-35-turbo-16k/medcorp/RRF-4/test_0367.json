    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a rash, watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain, which are consistent with rubella infection. The fact that her sister was diagnosed with rubella infection further supports this diagnosis. The patient's serology shows a positive IgG titer for rubella, indicating previous exposure or vaccination. The absence of IgM and high IgG avidity suggest that the infection is not recent. Given that rubella infection during pregnancy can have serious consequences for the fetus, the next step in management should be to reassure the patient and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum. Pregnancy termination is not indicated as the infection is not recent and there is no evidence of fetal involvement. Chorionic villus sampling is not necessary as there is no indication of fetal abnormalities. Additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19 is not necessary as the patient's symptoms and serology are consistent with rubella infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
