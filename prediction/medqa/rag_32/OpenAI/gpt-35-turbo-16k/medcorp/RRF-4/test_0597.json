    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the most effective disinfectant to inactivate the picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. Document [0] states that peracetic acid concentrations between 160 mg/l and 1280 mg/l were effective in inactivating enteroviruses, which are a type of picornavirus. Document [1] also mentions that peracids, including peracetic acid, are effective in inactivating picornaviruses. Therefore, the most likely disinfectant to inactivate the picornavirus in question is peracetic acid. None of the given answer choices include peracetic acid, so the correct answer is not provided in the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
