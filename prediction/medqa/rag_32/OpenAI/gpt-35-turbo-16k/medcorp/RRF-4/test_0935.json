    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the cells shown in the first image of the complete blood count. To answer the question, we need to identify the cells in the image and determine their characteristics. The image is not provided, so we cannot directly identify the cells. However, we can use the information provided in the question to make an educated guess. The question states that the cells show an absolute increase, which suggests that they are a type of white blood cell. The options provided include characteristics of different types of white blood cells. We can eliminate options A and B because they describe characteristics of macrophages and cells expressing CD25, which are not necessarily related to the cells in question. Option C states that these cells normally constitute 25-40% of total leukocyte count, which is a characteristic of lymphocytes. Option D states that these cells have a lymphoid origin, which is consistent with lymphocytes. Therefore, the most likely answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
