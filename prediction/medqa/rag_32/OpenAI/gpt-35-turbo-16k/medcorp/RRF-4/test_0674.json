    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The new experimental drug increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium, which further increases glucose-dependent insulin production. Among the given options, the drug that has a mechanism of action most similar to this is Sitagliptin. Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which means it inhibits the enzyme DPP-4 that degrades incretins like GLP-1. By inhibiting DPP-4, Sitagliptin increases the levels of incretins, leading to increased glucose-dependent insulin production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
