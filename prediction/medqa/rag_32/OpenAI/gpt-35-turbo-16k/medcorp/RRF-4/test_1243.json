    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with persistent epigastric pain that worsens after eating and has a family history of similar symptoms. The metabolic panel shows hypercalcemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals multiple duodenal ulcers. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of MEN1 (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1), which is characterized by the development of tumors in multiple endocrine organs, including the pancreas, parathyroid glands, and pituitary gland. MEN1 can present with duodenal ulcers due to gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) in the pancreas, which cause increased gastric acid secretion and subsequent ulcer formation. Other manifestations of MEN1 can include parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia leading to hypercalcemia, and pituitary adenomas causing hormonal abnormalities. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) typically presents with heartburn and regurgitation, but not with duodenal ulcers. Gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as weight loss or gastrointestinal bleeding. VIPoma is a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), causing watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome). The patient does not have the characteristic symptoms of VIPoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is MEN1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
