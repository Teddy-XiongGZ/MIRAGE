    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the dotted line on the graph, we need to understand the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure. The graph represents the pressure-volume curve of the lungs. The dotted line corresponds to the lung volume at which the transpulmonary pressure is zero. This occurs at the end of expiration when the alveolar pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the dotted line corresponds to the functional residual capacity (FRC) of the lungs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Functional residual capacity\"}"
