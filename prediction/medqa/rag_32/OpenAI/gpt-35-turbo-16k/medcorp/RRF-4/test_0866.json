    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 11-month-old male infant who presented with an inability to stand and a deformed, edematous, and warm right calf after hitting his leg against a chair. On physical examination, there is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. Given these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is insufficient production of procollagen type 1, which is seen in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). OI is a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and joint hypermobility. The other answer choices are not associated with these clinical findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
