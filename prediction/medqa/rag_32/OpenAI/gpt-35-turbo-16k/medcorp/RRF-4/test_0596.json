    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn boy presented with tachypnea and increased work of breathing, which improved with an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP. However, three hours later, he developed cyanosis. The most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis is the oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+. Methemoglobinemia occurs when there is an increase in the concentration of methemoglobin, which is formed when the iron in hemoglobin is oxidized from the ferrous (Fe2+) to the ferric (Fe3+) state. This results in a decreased ability of hemoglobin to bind and release oxygen, leading to tissue hypoxia and cyanosis. The inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP is likely nitric oxide, which can cause methemoglobinemia as a side effect. Closure of the ductus arteriosus (choice B) would not cause cyanosis. Increase in concentration of serum myoglobin (choice A) and allosteric alteration of heme groups (choice D) are not the most likely causes of this infant's cyanosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
