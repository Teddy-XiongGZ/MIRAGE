    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain for 2 months. The pain started after a traumatic event (being hit by a baseball) and has not improved with ibuprofen. On examination, there is tenderness along the left mid-femur. Laboratory studies show leukocytosis and an elevated ESR. X-ray shows lytic lesions in the femur with surrounding new bone formation. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. These findings are consistent with Ewing sarcoma, which is a malignant bone tumor that commonly presents with pain and swelling in the affected bone. It is more common in children and adolescents. Osteosarcoma is another malignant bone tumor, but it typically presents with a mass and is less likely to have lytic lesions on x-ray. Osteochondroma is a benign bone tumor that presents as a painless mass. Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor that presents with localized pain that is typically relieved by NSAIDs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
