    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 12-year-old boy with persistent bleeding from his left nostril. The bleeding started spontaneously and there is no history of abnormal bleeding in the family. On examination, blood is seen dripping from the left nostril. The most appropriate initial therapy for this patient is to manually squeeze the nostrils for 10 minutes with the head elevated. This is known as direct pressure and is the first-line treatment for epistaxis. Anterior packing and topical antibiotics (choice A) may be considered if direct pressure fails to control the bleeding. Oxymetazoline nasal spray (choice B) may be used as an adjunct to direct pressure, but it is not the most appropriate initial therapy. Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril (choice C) is not recommended as the first-line treatment for epistaxis. It may be considered if direct pressure and anterior packing fail to control the bleeding. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
