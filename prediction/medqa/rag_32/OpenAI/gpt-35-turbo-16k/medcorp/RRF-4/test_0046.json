    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to find the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and then take the reciprocal of the ARR. The ARR is calculated by subtracting the event rate in the medication 1 group from the event rate in the medication 2 group. In this case, the event rate in the medication 1 group is 134/1500 = 0.0893 and the event rate in the medication 2 group is 210/1500 = 0.14. Therefore, the ARR is 0.14 - 0.0893 = 0.0507. Taking the reciprocal of the ARR, we get 1/0.0507 = 19.7. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the NNT is 20.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
