    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the characteristic of fexofenadine that allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine. To answer this, we need to compare the two medications. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and has sedating effects due to its ability to antagonize histamine H1 receptors in the central nervous system. On the other hand, fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine that has a lower lipophilicity, which means it has less ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore has less sedating effects. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Relative lipophobicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
