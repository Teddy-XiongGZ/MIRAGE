    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms and the autopsy findings suggest a viral infection that spread to the central nervous system (CNS). To determine the likely causal virus and the mode of spread to the CNS, we need to consider the patient's history and the characteristics of different viral infections. The patient's history of flu-like symptoms and recent travel to Mexico suggest a possible viral infection acquired during the trip. Given the symptoms of acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia, as well as the rapid progression to coma and death, the viral infection likely affected the CNS directly. Among the options provided, retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons and reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia are more commonly associated with certain viral infections, such as herpes viruses. In this case, hematogenous dissemination to the meninges is the most likely mode of spread to the CNS, as it is a common route for many viral infections to reach the brain and meninges. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
