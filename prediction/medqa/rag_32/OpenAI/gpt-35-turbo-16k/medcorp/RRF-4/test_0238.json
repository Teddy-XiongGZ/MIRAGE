    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the definitions of incidence and prevalence. Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that occur within a specific time period, while prevalence refers to the total number of existing cases of a disease at a specific point in time. In this study, incident cases are defined as the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases are those that were coded as having SLE at any time. Therefore, the incidence rate will be higher during shorter time periods because it only includes new cases that occurred within that specific time frame. On the other hand, prevalence will be higher during longer time periods because it includes both new and existing cases. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
