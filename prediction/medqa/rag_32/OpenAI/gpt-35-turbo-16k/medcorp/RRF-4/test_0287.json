The presence of crackles and wheezes on examination suggests an underlying infection. Antibiotics are indicated in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD to target the underlying infection. The choice of antibiotic should cover the common pathogens associated with exacerbations of COPD, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin are all appropriate choices for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD.
