    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman's younger brother has a disease that requires him to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine, suggesting a possible diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must be carriers of the disease-causing gene for their children to be affected. Since the woman's parents are healthy and she has no symptoms of the disease, it is unlikely that she is a carrier. Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is 0%, meaning she is not a carrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
