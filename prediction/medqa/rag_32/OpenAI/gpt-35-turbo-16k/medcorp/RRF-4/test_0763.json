Thiamine is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Among the given reactions, the deficient vitamin mediates the reaction: Isocitrate + NAD+ <=> Alpha-Ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH, which is catalyzed by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase in the citric acid cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
