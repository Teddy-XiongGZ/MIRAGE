    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells. When absorbed in tissue, ionizing radiation damages the DNA in cancer cells, which increases the probability of apoptosis (cell death). Normal cells are able to repair radiation damage, while cancer cells are not. Therefore, radiation therapy exploits this fact to treat cancer. The damage to DNA caused by radiation therapy includes breaks in double-stranded DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
