    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To maintain a steady state, the dose administered at each dosing interval should be equal to the amount eliminated during that interval. The elimination rate can be calculated using the formula: elimination rate = clearance x plasma concentration. In this case, the elimination rate would be 15.0 L/h x 2 mg/L = 30 mg/h. Since the drug is administered twice per day, the total dose administered in 24 hours should be equal to the elimination rate multiplied by 24 hours. Therefore, the total dose in 24 hours should be 30 mg/h x 24 h = 720 mg. Since the oral bioavailability is 75%, the dose administered at each dosing interval should be 720 mg / 2 = 360 mg. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 240 mg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
