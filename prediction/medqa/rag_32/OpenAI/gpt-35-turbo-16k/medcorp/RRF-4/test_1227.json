    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Beta-1 receptors are primarily located in the heart, and their blockade leads to a decrease in heart rate. Beta-2 receptors are primarily located in the bronchial smooth muscle and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, and their activation leads to bronchodilation and increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Since propranolol blocks beta-2 receptors, the expected effect upon administration of epinephrine, which activates beta-2 receptors, would be a decrease in bronchodilation and motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Decreased bronchodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
