    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weakness, difficulty feeding, and cardiomegaly. These findings are suggestive of a metabolic disorder involving glycogen storage. The tongue protrusion and distended neck veins suggest cardiac involvement. The profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles suggests a myopathy. The most likely enzyme defect in this patient is glycogen debranching enzyme (choice D), which is responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to glycogen accumulation in various tissues, including the heart and skeletal muscles, resulting in cardiomegaly and muscle weakness. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase (choice A) deficiency would present with exercise intolerance and muscle cramps, but not with cardiomegaly. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (choice B) deficiency would present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly, but not with cardiomegaly. Lysosomal acid maltase (choice C) deficiency would present with hepatomegaly and muscle weakness, but not with cardiomegaly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
