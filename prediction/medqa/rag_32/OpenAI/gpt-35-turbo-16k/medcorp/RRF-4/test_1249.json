    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 55-year-old woman with postmenopausal bleeding. The most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding is atrophic endometrium, which is characterized by thinning of the endometrial lining. In this case, the endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasound is 6 mm, which is considered normal. The endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no atypia, suggesting benign endometrial hyperplasia. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be reassurance and follow-up. It is important to monitor the patient for resolution of symptoms and to ensure that the bleeding does not recur or worsen. If the bleeding persists or if there are any concerning findings on follow-up, further evaluation or treatment may be necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
