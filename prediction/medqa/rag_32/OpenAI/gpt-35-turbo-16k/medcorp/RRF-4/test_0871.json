    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms of pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms, and blood in semen with painful ejaculation, along with the physical examination findings of a mildly tender prostate, the most likely diagnosis is chronic prostatitis. The negative culture of the expressed prostatic secretion suggests a non-bacterial etiology, making chronic non-bacterial prostatitis (choice B) the most likely diagnosis.
