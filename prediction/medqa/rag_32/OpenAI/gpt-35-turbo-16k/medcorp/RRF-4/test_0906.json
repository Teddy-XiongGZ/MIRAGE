    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with intermittent chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss. Cardiac examination reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm and a mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex. The transthoracic echocardiogram shows a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a mass in the left atrium. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a left atrial myxoma. Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors and are typically located in the left atrium. They are composed of a mixture of cells from different germinal layers, including stellate and spindle-shaped cells, and may contain areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Therefore, the biopsy of the mass is likely to show a mixture of cells from different germinal layers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
