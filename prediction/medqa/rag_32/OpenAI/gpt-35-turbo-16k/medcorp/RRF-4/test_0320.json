    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of ulcerative colitis, worsening abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, along with the findings of a distended, rigid abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds, the most likely diagnosis is toxic megacolon, which is a severe complication of ulcerative colitis. The next step in management should be to obtain an abdominal x-ray to evaluate for signs of colonic dilation and to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. Abdominal CT scan with contrast or CT angiography may be considered if the x-ray is inconclusive or if there is suspicion of other complications such as perforation or ischemia. Colonoscopy is contraindicated in the setting of toxic megacolon due to the risk of perforation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
