    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with irritability and episodes of pallor and cyanosis, which are suggestive of a cyanotic heart defect. The physical examination findings of a small child in distress and a harsh systolic ejection murmur best heard at the upper left sternal border are consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot. This congenital heart defect is characterized by four anatomical abnormalities: ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, pulmonary stenosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The murmur is caused by the pulmonary stenosis. Transposition of great vessels is characterized by cyanosis without a murmur. Pulmonary hypoplasia and atrial septal defect would not present with the same combination of symptoms and physical examination findings as seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
