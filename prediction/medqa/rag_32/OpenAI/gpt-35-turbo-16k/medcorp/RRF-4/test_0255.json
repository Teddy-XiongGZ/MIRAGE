    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Kozak sequence mutation in the Beta-globin gene decreases translation efficiency, leading to a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. Thalassemia intermedia is characterized by a moderate to severe form of anemia. In terms of red blood cell morphology, thalassemia intermedia is typically associated with microcytic red blood cells, which are smaller than normal. Therefore, the expected blood smear finding in a patient positive for this Kozak sequence mutation would be microcytic red blood cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
