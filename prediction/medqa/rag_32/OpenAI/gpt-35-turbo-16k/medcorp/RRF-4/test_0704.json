    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant is presenting with jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. The fact that the infant is breastfeeding well and sleeping for 7-8 hours at night without interruption suggests that he is receiving adequate nutrition and hydration. Jaundice in a breastfed infant is usually due to breast milk jaundice, which is a benign condition caused by substances in breast milk that can interfere with the breakdown of bilirubin.

Switching from breast milk to formula is not necessary and may not resolve the jaundice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
