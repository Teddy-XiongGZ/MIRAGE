    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with difficult arousal, dry skin and mucous membranes, and laboratory values consistent with hypernatremia (elevated serum sodium). This suggests that the patient is experiencing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) or hypernatremic dehydration. The best next step in management would be to provide intravenous fluid therapy to correct the dehydration and hypernatremia. The choice of fluid depends on the severity of the dehydration and the patient's glucose level. In this case, the patient's glucose level is normal, so the best choice would be 0.9% saline IV (choice A) to correct the dehydration without exacerbating the hyperglycemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
