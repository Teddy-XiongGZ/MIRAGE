    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of progressively worsening chest pain and nausea, along with his history of untreated hypertension and recent cocaine abuse, the first step in management should be to assess the patient's hemodynamic stability. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress, suggesting that he may be experiencing a hypertensive emergency or acute coronary syndrome. Therefore, the first step should be to provide reassurance and continuous monitoring to closely monitor his vital signs and cardiac rhythm. This will allow for prompt identification of any hemodynamic instability or life-threatening arrhythmias. Once the patient's stability is ensured, further management can be determined based on the underlying cause of his symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
