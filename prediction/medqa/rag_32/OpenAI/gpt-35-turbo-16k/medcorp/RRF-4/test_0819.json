    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not attained menarche and has a nontender left inguinal mass. Pelvic examination reveals a blind vaginal pouch and ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. These findings are consistent with m\u00fcllerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome. This condition is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper vagina. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is sex chromosome monosomy, specifically 46,XX. This is because m\u00fcllerian agenesis is commonly associated with Turner syndrome, which is characterized by the absence of one X chromosome (45,X). Therefore, the correct answer is C. Sex chromosome monosomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
