    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options are true in regards to physician compensation, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that as group practices transition from fee-for-service to managed care/capitated contracts, one of the major issues they face is how to divide up the revenue from capitated contracts. This suggests that capitation poses financial risk to physicians. Document [4] states that the new physician compensation plan developed for a primary care group practice put a greater portion of the physicians' compensation at risk and provided incentives for enhanced productivity in both the capitated and fee-for-service lines of business. This suggests that fee-for-service also poses financial risk to physicians. Document [5] mentions that fee-for-service compensation models must strike a balance between the financial viability of the practice and fair compensation for all physicians. This suggests that fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality. Based on this information, the true statement in regards to physician compensation is that C. Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
