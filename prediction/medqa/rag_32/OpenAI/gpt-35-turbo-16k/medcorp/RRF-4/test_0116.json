    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a seizure disorder, cognitive delay, right lower extremity weakness, and retinal lesions. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16. The TSC1 gene encodes for the protein hamartin, while the TSC2 gene encodes for the protein tuberin. Mutations in either gene can lead to the development of TSC. Therefore, the correct answer is C. TSC1 gene on chromosome 9.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
