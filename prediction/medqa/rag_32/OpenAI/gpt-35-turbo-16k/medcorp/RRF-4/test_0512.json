    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 35-year-old woman with a history of hyperthyroidism who is now confirmed to be pregnant. The next step in the management of this patient is to discontinue methimazole and start propylthiouracil. Methimazole is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of congenital abnormalities. Propylthiouracil is the preferred antithyroid medication during pregnancy as it has a lower risk of teratogenicity. Glucocorticoids are not indicated in this case as the patient is asymptomatic and her TSH level is within the normal range. Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy as it can cross the placenta and harm the developing fetus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
