    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study used retrospective surveys to collect data on folic acid supplementation before pregnancy. The participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. The most likely type of bias that could have influenced these results is recall bias. Recall bias occurs when participants have difficulty accurately remembering past events or experiences, leading to biased reporting. In this case, mothers of children with ASD may be more likely to recall and report higher rates of folic acid supplementation compared to mothers of healthy children, leading to an overestimation of the association between folic acid supplementation and lower rates of ASD. Therefore, the answer is C. Recall bias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
