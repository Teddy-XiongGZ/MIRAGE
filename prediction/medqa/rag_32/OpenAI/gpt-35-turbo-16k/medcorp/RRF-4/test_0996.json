    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the immunoglobulin found as a dimer is IgA. Document [6] states that IgA appears in two different molecular structures: monomeric (serum) and dimeric structure (secretory). Document [17] further explains that the dimeric form of IgA, also known as secretory IgA (sIgA), is the most prevalent form and is found in mucous secretions. It is the main immunoglobulin found in mucous secretions, including tears, saliva, sweat, colostrum, and secretions from the genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, prostate, and respiratory epithelium. Therefore, the primary function of IgA as a dimer is inhibiting bacterial adherence and colonization of mucous membranes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
