    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 78-year-old man with increasing forgetfulness, psychomotor retardation, blunted affect, impaired memory, and impaired attention and concentration. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia). The patient's symptoms are not suggestive of depression, so treatment with fluoxetine (A) would not be appropriate. Aspirin (B) is not indicated for the treatment of dementia. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (C) is used for the treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus, which typically presents with a triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. The patient does not have symptoms consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is memantine (D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
