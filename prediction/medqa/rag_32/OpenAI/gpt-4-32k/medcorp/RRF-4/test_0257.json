    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's initial presentation of hyperphenylalaninemia suggests phenylketonuria (PKU), a condition caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is necessary for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. When this enzyme is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates and can cause intellectual disability. The patient's physical features of blue eyes, pale skin, and blonde hair are due to decreased melanin synthesis, as tyrosine is a precursor for melanin. The patient's hypotonia and elevated prolactin level suggest a variant of PKU known as malignant or variant PKU. This is caused by a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor necessary for the function of phenylalanine hydroxylase. In addition to its role in phenylalanine metabolism, BH4 is also a necessary cofactor for the production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Therefore, a deficiency of BH4 leads to decreased production of these neurotransmitters, resulting in neurologic symptoms such as hypotonia. The treatment for malignant PKU includes both dietary restriction of phenylalanine and supplementation with BH4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tetrahydrobiopterin\"}"
