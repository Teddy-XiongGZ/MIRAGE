    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a nosebleed, also known as epistaxis. The first step in managing epistaxis is to ensure the patient is stable and not in any immediate danger, which seems to be the case here. The next step is to try and stop the bleeding. The patient is currently hyperextending his head, which is not recommended as it can lead to swallowing or aspiration of blood. The most appropriate initial therapy would be to have the patient pinch his nostrils together while sitting up and leaning forward. This can often stop the bleeding. If this doesn't work, then further interventions such as nasal sprays, packing, or cautery may be needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
