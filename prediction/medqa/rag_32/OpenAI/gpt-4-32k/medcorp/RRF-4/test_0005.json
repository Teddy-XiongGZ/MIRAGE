    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with chest pain, nausea, and is in marked distress. These symptoms, along with his history of hypertension, smoking, and recent cocaine use, suggest he may be experiencing a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack. Cocaine use can cause coronary artery vasoconstriction leading to myocardial ischemia and infarction. The first step in management should be to stabilize the patient and reduce the workload on the heart. Beta blockers are typically used to manage hypertension and reduce heart rate, but they are contraindicated in cocaine-induced chest pain because they can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation and worsen coronary vasoconstriction. Therefore, labetalol and propranolol are not appropriate choices. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, can be used to manage hypertension and reduce heart rate without the risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Reassurance and continuous monitoring alone would not be sufficient given the severity of the patient's symptoms and risk factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
