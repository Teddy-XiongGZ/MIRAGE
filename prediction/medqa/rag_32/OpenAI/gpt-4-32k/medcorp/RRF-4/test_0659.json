    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the additional findings on CT scans that would most likely prompt the removal of pulmonary nodules of the same size as the patient's. The 'popcorn' pattern is typically associated with hamartomas, which are benign lung tumors, so this would not likely prompt removal. Extending fine striations could be associated with inflammation or infection, but not necessarily with malignancy. A doubling time of less than 1 month is concerning for rapid growth, but this is not typically seen in lung cancer, as lung cancers usually grow more slowly. A subsolid component in a lung nodule can be concerning for malignancy, especially if the patient has a known primary cancer elsewhere in the body, such as this patient's prostate cancer. Therefore, a subsolid component would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
