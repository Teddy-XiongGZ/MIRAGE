    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand the terms. Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. In this case, sensitivity = 45/(45+5) = 0.9. Specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate), calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives. In this case, specificity = 35/(35+15) = 0.7. Statistical power, on the other hand, is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It's related to the sensitivity of the test, but it's not directly given in the problem. Now, let's analyze the options. Option A is incorrect because repeating the study could potentially affect the statistical power if the sample size or effect size changes. Option B is incorrect because we don't have enough information to calculate the power. Option C is incorrect because increasing the specificity (reducing false positives) does not necessarily increase the power of the test. Option D is correct because decreasing the sensitivity (increasing false negatives) would reduce the power of the test, as it would be less likely to correctly reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
