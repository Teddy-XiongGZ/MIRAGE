    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy who has a lump under his left nipple that is tender to touch. He has a history of cryptorchidism and is currently on medication for ADHD. His physical examination shows that he is in the Tanner IV stage of puberty, which is normal for his age. His testes are of normal size and texture. The lump is not associated with any skin changes or discharge, which makes conditions like cancer less likely. Klinefelter syndrome is usually associated with small testes, which is not the case here. Lipomastia or pseudogynecomastia is usually associated with obesity, which is also not the case here. Given his age and the description of the lump, it is most likely that this is glandular tissue enlargement, which is a normal part of puberty in boys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
