    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with multiple injuries from a high-speed motor vehicle collision. He is currently unresponsive and only reacts to painful stimuli. His physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds over the right lung base and tenderness over the left chest wall, which could indicate a pneumothorax or hemothorax. His abdomen is also tender, suggesting possible internal injury. Given his current state of altered consciousness and potential for respiratory compromise, securing his airway through intubation and mechanical ventilation should be the immediate priority. Other injuries can be addressed subsequently.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Intubation and mechanical ventilation\"}"
