    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The goal of treatment in such cases is to relieve symptoms and prevent further exacerbations. Oral prednisone is often used in the acute setting to reduce inflammation, but it does not necessarily prevent future exacerbations. Supplemental oxygen is used in patients with severe COPD and hypoxemia, but it does not prevent exacerbations. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used in the treatment of asthma and to a lesser extent COPD, but it is not the first-line treatment for preventing COPD exacerbations. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine has mucolytic properties and has been shown in some studies to reduce exacerbations in COPD patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine\"}"
