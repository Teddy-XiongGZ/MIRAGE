    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not undergone puberty yet, which is unusual as puberty typically begins between ages 8-13 in girls. She is in Tanner stage I, which is the stage of prepubertal growth and development. This suggests a delay in puberty. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which is not typically associated with delayed puberty. However, it could be a clue to an underlying condition. Looking at the options, aromatase enzyme deficiency typically presents with ambiguous or male genitalia in genetic females, which is not the case here. Hypokalemia is a condition characterized by low potassium levels in the blood, which is not mentioned in the scenario. An XY karyotype would suggest a disorder of sex development, but the patient has normal female genitalia. Hypercortisolism, or high cortisol levels, can delay growth and puberty, and can also cause high blood pressure. Therefore, this seems like the most likely additional finding in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
