    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of reduced urine output and increased serum creatinine concentration suggest acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which are risk factors for chronic kidney disease, could potentially contribute to the development of AKI. However, the patient's baseline creatinine was normal, suggesting that he did not have pre-existing chronic kidney disease. The patient's medication list includes losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, and ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Both of these medications can cause AKI, particularly in a setting of volume depletion or sepsis, which could be present due to the patient's acute diverticulitis. The patient's urinalysis shows proteinuria, which can be caused by NSAID-induced interstitial nephritis or by diabetic nephropathy. However, the acute onset of the patient's symptoms and the temporal relationship to the administration of ketoprofen suggest an adverse drug reaction as the most likely cause of the patient's AKI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
