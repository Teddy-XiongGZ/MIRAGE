    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a bacterial strain that grows in a specialized culture containing sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite, and forms black, shiny colonies. Looking at the documents, Document [7] describes a Corynebacterium species that grows well on a medium supplemented with potassium tellurite, cystine, and forms black colonies with a black halo. This matches the description given in the question. Therefore, the bacteria is most likely Corynebacterium diphtheriae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Corynebacterium diphtheriae\"}"
