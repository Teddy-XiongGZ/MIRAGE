    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion, along with his history of long-term smoking, suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. This is typically measured by spirometry, which would show a decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Additionally, COPD often leads to air trapping, which would result in an increased residual volume (the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation). Therefore, the patient would most likely have an increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
