    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is on a drug that blocks the androgen receptor, which is a type of antiandrogen. This is used to reduce the action of testosterone, which can slow the growth of prostate cancer. Looking at the options, leuprolide is a GnRH agonist, not an antiandrogen. Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, which prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone but does not block the androgen receptor. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used in breast cancer to prevent the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Flutamide, however, is an antiandrogen that blocks the androgen receptor, similar to the experimental drug the patient is taking.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Flutamide\"}"
