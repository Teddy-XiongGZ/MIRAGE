    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is characterized by hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia, which are signs of neurogenic shock. This type of shock is usually caused by a spinal cord injury, which disrupts the sympathetic nervous system's control over blood vessel tone and heart rate. The patient's stab wounds could have potentially damaged his spinal cord. Cardiac tamponade would typically present with tachycardia, not bradycardia. Pulmonary embolism would also typically cause tachycardia and potentially hypoxia, which is not mentioned in the case. Pneumonia is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms as there is no mention of respiratory symptoms or signs of infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
