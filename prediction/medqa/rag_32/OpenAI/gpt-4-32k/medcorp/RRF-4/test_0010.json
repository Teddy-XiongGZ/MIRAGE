    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where a pregnant woman presents in labor and undergoes rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This suggests that the rapid screening test was for HIV. The question then asks about the confirmatory test for HIV. According to Document [0], if the rapid HIV screening is positive, further confirmatory testing should be performed. The confirmatory test for HIV is not a Southwestern blot, Northern blot for DNA or RNA. Instead, it is an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay, which can differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and confirm the diagnosis of HIV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
