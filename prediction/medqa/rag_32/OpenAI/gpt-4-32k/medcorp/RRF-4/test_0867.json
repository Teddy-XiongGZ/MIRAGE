    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of swelling and severe pain in the left lower leg, along with the finding of a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow in the popliteal vein on ultrasonography, are indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's risk factors for DVT include his obesity (BMI of 30.7 kg/m2), smoking history, and family history of pulmonary embolism. Among the answer choices, all are potential causes of hypercoagulability and could theoretically lead to DVT. However, Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited hypercoagulable state among Caucasians and often presents as DVT in young patients.
