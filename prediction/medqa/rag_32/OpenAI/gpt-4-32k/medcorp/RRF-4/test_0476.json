    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a hemolytic anemia, which is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be made. The fact that the Coombs test is negative indicates that this is not an autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The increased osmotic fragility of the red blood cells is a characteristic feature of hereditary spherocytosis, a genetic condition where the red blood cells are sphere-shaped instead of the normal disc shape, making them more prone to rupture. Therefore, if a blood smear were obtained, we would expect to see spherocytes, which are spherical red blood cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
