    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of hypotension and tachycardia after delivery, along with a boggy uterus, suggest postpartum hemorrhage. The aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion further support this diagnosis. Postpartum hemorrhage can lead to hypovolemic shock, which can cause ischemic injury to various organs, including the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is particularly vulnerable to ischemic injury due to its vascular supply. Ischemic injury to the pituitary gland can result in pituitary infarction, also known as Sheehan syndrome. Sheehan syndrome is characterized by postpartum necrosis of the anterior pituitary gland, leading to hypopituitarism. One of the hormones produced by the anterior pituitary gland is prolactin, which is necessary for lactation. Therefore, pituitary infarction could explain the patient's inability to lactate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
