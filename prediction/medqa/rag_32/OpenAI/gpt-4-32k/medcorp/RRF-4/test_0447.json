    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of chronic alcohol use, physical examination findings of spider angiomata, and altered mental status suggest alcoholic cirrhosis with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to esophageal varices. This has resulted in hypovolemic shock, as evidenced by tachycardia, hypotension, pale appearance, weak pulses, and delayed capillary refill. In response to hypovolemia, the body will increase systemic vascular resistance (vasoconstriction) to maintain blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. Carotid baroreceptor firing activity will increase in response to decreased arterial pressure, leading to increased sympathetic outflow (causing vasoconstriction and increased heart rate). Cardiac inotropy (contractility) will also increase via sympathetic stimulation to maintain cardiac output. However, despite these compensatory mechanisms, blood flow to non-vital tissues (eg, skin, muscles) will decrease, leading to increased extraction of oxygen from hemoglobin by these tissues. Therefore, the fractional tissue oxygen extraction will be increased in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
