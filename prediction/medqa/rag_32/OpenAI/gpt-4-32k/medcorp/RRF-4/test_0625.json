    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had an allergic reaction to a blood transfusion, which was treated with epinephrine. This suggests that the patient had an anaphylactic reaction, which is typically mediated by IgE antibodies. However, the physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder. One of the most common immunodeficiency disorders associated with anaphylactic reactions to blood products is selective IgA deficiency. This is because individuals with this condition may produce IgE antibodies against IgA, which can be present in blood products. Therefore, if serum is taken from this patient, we would expect to see low levels of IgA, with normal levels of other immunoglobulins such as IgG and IgM.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
