    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in the question has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is being treated with low-dose prednisone, a glucocorticoid. Long-term glucocorticoid use is associated with several side effects, including osteoporosis. Osteoporosis, in turn, increases the risk of fractures, particularly in areas with a lot of trabecular (spongy) bone such as the femoral neck. Femoral shaft fractures, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and proximal phalanx fractures are not specifically associated with long-term glucocorticoid use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
