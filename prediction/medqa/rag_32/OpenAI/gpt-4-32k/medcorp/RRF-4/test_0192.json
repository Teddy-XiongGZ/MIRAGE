    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the reason why there is a difference in the relationship between DLBCL risk and cART adherence in patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and those with counts above 200/mm3. The key here is that the relationship changes depending on the level of the CD4+ cell count, which is a characteristic of effect modification. Effect modification occurs when the effect of a main exposure on an outcome is modified by the level of another variable. In this case, the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by the level of the CD4+ cell count. This is not a case of poor generalizability, stratified sampling, or random error.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
