    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sharp, severe chest pain that increases when lying down and improves with leaning forward, along with the physical exam finding of a scratching sound over the left sternal border, are indicative of pericarditis. The ECG would likely show diffuse ST elevation and PR depression, which are characteristic of pericarditis. The treatment for pericarditis typically involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or indomethacin, often in combination with a gastroprotective agent like omeprazole to prevent NSAID-induced gastritis. Colchicine is also often added to reduce the risk of recurrent pericarditis. Pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy would be more appropriate for cases of cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis, which do not seem to be present in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole\"}"
