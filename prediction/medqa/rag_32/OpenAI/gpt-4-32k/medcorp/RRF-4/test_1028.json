    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an enzyme that is likely to be increased in a liposarcoma. Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor of adipose tissue, which means it has the ability to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body. This ability to proliferate and spread is often associated with the activity of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is an enzyme that adds DNA sequence repeats to the 3' end of DNA strands in the telomere regions, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. This prevents the telomeres from shortening with each round of cell division, thereby allowing the cells to divide indefinitely. This is a characteristic feature of most cancer cells, including liposarcoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Telomerase\"}"
