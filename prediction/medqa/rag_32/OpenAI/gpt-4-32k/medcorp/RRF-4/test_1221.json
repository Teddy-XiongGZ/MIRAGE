    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of alcoholism and the finding of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine suggest a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol, a component of antifreeze, is metabolized in the body to oxalic acid, which can combine with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals. This process can lead to acute kidney injury, which may explain the patient's decreased urination. Ethylene glycol poisoning is also associated with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of glycolic acid and other organic acids in the body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
