    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exenatide is a drug used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, not type 1. It works by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. This means it requires some level of insulin production by the pancreas to be effective, which is not the case in type 1 diabetes where the pancreas produces little to no insulin. Therefore, the patient should not be switched to exenatide because his pancreas does not produce enough insulin for the drug to work effectively.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
