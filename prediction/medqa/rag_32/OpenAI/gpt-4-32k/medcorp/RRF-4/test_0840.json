    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a reaction that occurs 48 hours after the injection of Candida into the skin, resulting in a raised, hardened area. This delayed reaction suggests a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity. This type of reaction is mediated by T cells, specifically CD4+ T cells, which are responsible for cell-mediated immunity. Therefore, the answer is likely to be a type IV hypersensitivity reaction involving CD4+ T cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells\"}"
