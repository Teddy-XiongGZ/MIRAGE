    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The stillborn infant's presentation of a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae is suggestive of caudal regression syndrome. This condition is characterized by abnormal development of the lower spine and is associated with maternal diabetes. Document [6] supports this, stating that dorsolumbosacral agenesis, which involves the absence of lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae, is a severe form of caudal regression syndrome.

Therefore, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is maternal diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Maternal diabetes\"}"
