    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid. This could be indicative of a molar pregnancy. In such cases, the ovaries may develop theca lutein cysts due to overstimulation by high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the molar pregnancy. Theca lutein cysts are typically bilateral and multilocular, filled with clear fluid, which matches the description in the question. Chocolate cysts are associated with endometriosis and would not be related to the intrauterine findings. Corpus luteum cysts are common in early pregnancy and typically resolve as the placenta develops, and they are usually not associated with molar pregnancies. Yolk sac tumors are malignant and would present with solid rather than cystic ovarian masses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Theca leutein cysts\"}"
