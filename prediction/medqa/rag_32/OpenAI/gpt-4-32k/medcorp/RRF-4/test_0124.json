    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition that affects newborns and is caused by an underactive thyroid gland. The symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism can vary. Hypotonia, or decreased muscle tone, is a common symptom of congenital hypothyroidism. Macroglossia, or an enlarged tongue, is also a common symptom. An umbilical hernia, which is a bulge near the belly button, can also occur in babies with congenital hypothyroidism. However, diarrhea is not typically associated with congenital hypothyroidism. Instead, these babies often have constipation due to slowed gut motility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Diarrhea\"}"
