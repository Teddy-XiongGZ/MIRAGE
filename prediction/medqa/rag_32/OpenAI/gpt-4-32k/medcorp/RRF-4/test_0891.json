    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with signs of preterm labor, which is defined as regular uterine contractions resulting in cervical effacement and dilation between 20 and 37 weeks of gestation. The patient is at 26 weeks, which is within this range. The goal of management in preterm labor is to prolong pregnancy to allow for administration of antenatal corticosteroids, which accelerate fetal lung maturity and decrease neonatal mortality and morbidity. Tocolytic agents, such as nifedipine, can be used to inhibit labor and prolong pregnancy. Misoprostol is used for labor induction and cervical ripening, which is not the goal in this case. Dilation and evacuation is a procedure used to manage miscarriage or abortion, not preterm labor. Allowing vaginal delivery would not be appropriate given the gestational age of the fetus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
