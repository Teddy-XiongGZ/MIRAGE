    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 35-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive for more than a year without success. She has a history of a successful pregnancy and birth, and her husband's semen analysis is normal. Her menses are regular, which suggests that she is ovulating regularly. There is no history of severe illness or symptoms suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease, such as pelvic pain or abnormal vaginal discharge. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and premature ovarian failure are unlikely given her regular menses and previous successful pregnancy. The most likely cause of her infertility is diminished ovarian reserve, which is a common cause of infertility in women over 35.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
