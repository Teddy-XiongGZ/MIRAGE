    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a benign breast mass. The rapid growth of the mass and the histological findings of papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia are characteristic of a phyllodes tumor. Fibroadenomas are also benign breast masses, but they typically do not grow rapidly and do not show atypia. Fibrocystic disease of the breast usually presents with multiple, often bilateral, lumps that fluctuate in size with the menstrual cycle, which is not the case here. Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that typically presents as a hard, irregular mass, not a smooth polylobulated mass as in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
