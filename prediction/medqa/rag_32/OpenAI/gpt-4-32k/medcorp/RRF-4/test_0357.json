    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's arterial blood gas results show a low pH, indicating acidemia, and a high PaCO2, indicating hypercapnia. This suggests a primary respiratory acidosis. The normal bicarbonate level indicates that there has been insufficient time for renal compensation, suggesting an acute process. Among the options, both amitriptyline and heroin can cause central nervous system depression leading to respiratory depression and subsequent acute respiratory acidosis. However, the patient's history of polysubstance abuse and multiple suicide attempts, along with the presence of multiple bruises, raises the possibility of a drug overdose. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is commonly implicated in overdoses due to its widespread use and lethal toxicity in overdose. Cocaine and ethylene glycol do not typically cause respiratory depression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Amitriptyline\"}"
