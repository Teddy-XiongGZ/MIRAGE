    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle. When the Rb protein is in its active, hypophosphorylated state, it binds to the E2F transcription factor, preventing it from activating genes necessary for progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. This effectively causes the cell to arrest in the G1 phase. However, when the Rb protein is phosphorylated, it releases E2F, allowing the cell to progress into the S phase. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), when activated, phosphorylates the Rb protein. Therefore, a drug that activates CDK4 would likely result in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the Rb protein, leading to the initiation of the S phase of the cell cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
