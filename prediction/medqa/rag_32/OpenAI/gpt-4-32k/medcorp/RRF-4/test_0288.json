    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of fever, irritability, and neck rigidity suggests that he had meningitis, which was treated with antibiotics. His current symptoms of morning headaches, nausea, and vomiting, along with the MRI findings of bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space, suggest that he now has hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is often a complication of meningitis and is caused by impaired CSF flow. The CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, flows through the ventricles, and is absorbed into the bloodstream through the arachnoid granulations. In this case, the patient's hydrocephalus is most likely due to impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations, which can occur as a result of scarring from the meningitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
