    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. From the given options, Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, not the cortical collecting tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that acts on the early distal convoluted tubule, not the cortical collecting tubule. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that acts on the proximal convoluted tubule, not the cortical collecting tubule. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts on the late distal tubule and cortical collecting duct, blocking sodium channels and inhibiting sodium reabsorption. Therefore, the correct answer is Triamterene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
