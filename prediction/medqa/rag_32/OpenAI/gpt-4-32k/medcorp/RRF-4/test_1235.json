    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman's disease is described as causing recurrent upper respiratory infections and requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. This is consistent with cystic fibrosis, which is an autosomal recessive disease. This means that both parents must pass on a defective gene for a child to have the disease. The woman has the disease, so she carries two defective genes. Her husband is from a population where the prevalence of the disease is 1/100, so the chance that he is a carrier (has one defective gene) is 2*(1/100)*(99/100) = 0.0198 or about 1/50. The chance that their child will have the disease is the chance that the husband passes on his defective gene, which is 1/2 (since he is a carrier), times the chance that the woman passes on one of her defective genes, which is 1 (since she has the disease). Therefore, the chance that their child will have the disease is 1/2 * 1/50 = 1/100.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
