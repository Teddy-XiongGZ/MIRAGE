    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a type of white blood cell, but it doesn't specify which one. However, the answer choices give some clues. Choice A suggests a cell that transforms into a macrophage, which would be a monocyte. Choice B suggests a cell that expresses CD25, which is a marker for activated T cells. Choice C suggests a cell that makes up 25-40% of the total leukocyte count, which would be lymphocytes. Choice D suggests a cell of lymphoid origin, which could be either a lymphocyte or a natural killer cell. Since the question stem doesn't provide enough information to definitively identify the cell type, I would need to see the image mentioned in the question to make a final decision.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Need Image to Answer\"}"
