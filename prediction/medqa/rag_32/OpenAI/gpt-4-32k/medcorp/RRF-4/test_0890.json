    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a T-score of -3.2 SDs in the hip, which indicates osteoporosis. The patient also has a history of fracture, which is a risk factor for future fractures. Therefore, the patient is at high risk for future fractures and should be started on a medication to reduce this risk. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that is first-line therapy for osteoporosis and has been shown to reduce the risk of hip and vertebral fractures. Calcitonin is less effective than bisphosphonates and is usually reserved for patients who cannot tolerate other treatments. Estrogen is used for prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women but is not first-line therapy for treatment. Tamoxifen is used for prevention of breast cancer and does not have a role in the treatment of osteoporosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
