    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where two babies are born to the same mother at the same gestational age, but with different weights and physical characteristics. This suggests that the babies are not identical, ruling out the possibility of them being monozygotic twins (options A and C). Conjoined twins (option D) are physically joined in some way, which is not described in the scenario. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the babies are dizygotic twins, meaning they developed from two different eggs fertilized by two different sperm. Dizygotic twins also have their own chorion and amnion, making them dichorionic-diamniotic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
