    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It has estrogenic effects on bone (increases bone mineral density), and anti-estrogenic effects on the uterus and breast (decreases risk of invasive breast cancer). However, similar to estrogen, raloxifene increases the risk of thromboembolic events, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It does not increase the risk of cellulitis, breast cancer, or hypercholesterolemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
