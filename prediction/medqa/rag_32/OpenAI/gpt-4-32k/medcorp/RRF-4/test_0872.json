    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The splenic artery is a branch of the celiac trunk, along with the left gastric artery and the common hepatic artery. The left gastric artery supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach, the common hepatic artery gives off the proper hepatic artery (to the liver) and the gastroduodenal artery (to the stomach and first part of the duodenum). The left gastroepiploic artery is a branch of the splenic artery and it supplies the greater curvature of the stomach. Therefore, if the splenic artery is ligated at its origin, the left gastroepiploic artery will be hypoperfused.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Left gastroepiploic artery\"}"
