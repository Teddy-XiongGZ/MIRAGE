    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's break down each choice. A. Capitation is a payment arrangement where physicians receive a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to them, per period of time, whether or not that person seeks care. It does not pose the least financial risk to physicians, as they are responsible for providing all necessary care within this set amount. B. Fee-for-service is a payment model where services are unbundled and paid for separately. It does not pay physicians a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care. Instead, it pays for each service provided. C. Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality. This is true because under this model, the more services a physician provides, the more they get paid, which could lead to unnecessary procedures or tests. D. Fee-for-service poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians. This is not necessarily true. The financial risk in fee-for-service is more on the payer's side, as they are responsible for paying for all services provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
