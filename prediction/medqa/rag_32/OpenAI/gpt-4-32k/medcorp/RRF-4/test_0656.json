    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and the acute presentation with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and signs of peritonitis (tense abdomen with board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness) strongly suggest a complication of his peptic ulcer disease. The two most common complications are bleeding and perforation. The patient's vomiting of brown/red material suggests bleeding, but the severe pain and signs of peritonitis are more consistent with perforation. An erect abdominal x-ray can help confirm the diagnosis by showing free air under the diaphragm, a sign of perforation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a perforated gastric peptic ulcer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
