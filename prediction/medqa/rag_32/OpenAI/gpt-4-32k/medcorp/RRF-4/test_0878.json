    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the correct method of transporting an amputated finger. The key point here is to preserve the tissue in a way that it can potentially be reattached. Submerging the finger directly in ice water or placing it directly on ice could cause further damage to the tissue due to frostbite. Wrapping the finger in moist gauze helps to keep the tissue moist and viable. Placing the wrapped finger in a plastic bag and then on ice helps to keep it cool without direct contact with the ice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
