    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of perioral numbness, muscle cramping, and a positive Trousseau sign (carpopedal spasm induced by the inflation of a blood pressure cuff) are suggestive of hypocalcemia. His recent history of total thyroidectomy is significant because inadvertent removal or devascularization of the parathyroid glands can occur during thyroid surgery, leading to hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. The patient's elevated parathyroid hormone level is likely secondary to the hypocalcemia and represents an appropriate response by the remaining, functioning parathyroid tissue. The most appropriate initial management of symptomatic hypocalcemia is intravenous calcium gluconate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Administer calcium gluconate\"}"
