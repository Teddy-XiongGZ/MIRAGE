    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, long sleep time, and episodes of cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions) suggest narcolepsy. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 17 also indicates severe daytime sleepiness. Modafinil is a first-line treatment for narcolepsy. It promotes wakefulness and reduces excessive daytime sleepiness. Clomipramine is used for cataplexy but it does not address the patient's primary complaint of excessive sleepiness. Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant used for narcolepsy but it is not first-line due to potential for abuse. Sleep deprivation is not a treatment for narcolepsy and can worsen symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Modafinil\"}"
