    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene that leads to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin molecule, hemoglobin S (HbS). This mutation causes red blood cells to assume a sickle shape, especially under low oxygen conditions. Hydroxyurea is a drug that is commonly used to treat sickle cell anemia. According to the documents, hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in patients with sickle cell disease. Fetal hemoglobin is not affected by the genetic defect that causes sickle cell disease and its increased levels decrease the tendency toward intracellular polymerization of sickle hemoglobin that characterizes this disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)\"}"
