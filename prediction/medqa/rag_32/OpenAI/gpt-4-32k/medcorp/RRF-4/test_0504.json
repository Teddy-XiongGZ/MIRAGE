    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has a history of recurrent ear infections and current findings of retracted, immobile tympanic membranes, which are indicative of otitis media with effusion (OME). OME is a collection of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. It is often asymptomatic and can occur spontaneously due to dysfunction of the eustachian tube, especially following an upper respiratory tract infection. However, OME can cause conductive hearing loss and speech delay in children, as seen in this patient. The first-line treatment for OME in children with hearing loss or speech delay is myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion. This procedure helps drain the fluid and ventilate the middle ear, which can improve hearing and language development. Adenoidectomy (choice A) is not the first-line treatment for OME but can be considered in children who do not improve after tympanostomy tube placement or who have concurrent nasal obstruction or chronic sinusitis. Antihistamines (choice C) and corticosteroids (choice D) are not recommended for routine management of OME.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
