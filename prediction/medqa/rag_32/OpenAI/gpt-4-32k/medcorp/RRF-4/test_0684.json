    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of recurrent episodes of facial swelling and the current presentation of abdominal pain and vomiting with segmental intestinal wall thickening on ultrasound are suggestive of angioedema. Angioedema is characterized by self-limited episodes of swelling in the deep layers of the skin and mucosa. It can be hereditary or acquired, and it can be mediated by either mast cells or bradykinin. Mast cell-mediated angioedema (eg, allergic angioedema) is often pruritic and associated with urticaria, which this patient does not have. In contrast, bradykinin-mediated angioedema (eg, hereditary angioedema, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema) is nonpruritic and not associated with urticaria. Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a deficiency of C1 inhibitor (a key regulator of the complement and contact plasma kallikrein-kinin systems), leading to overproduction of bradykinin. This patient's history of recurrent angioedema without an obvious trigger (eg, medication, allergen) and normal vital signs (ie, no pruritus, urticaria, bronchospasm, or hypotension) suggest bradykinin-mediated (specifically, hereditary) angioedema.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Complement inhibitor deficiency\"}"
