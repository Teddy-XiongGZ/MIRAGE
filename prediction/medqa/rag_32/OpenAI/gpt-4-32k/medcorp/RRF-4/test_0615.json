    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of episodic neck stiffness and pain, with the neck rotating to the right, are suggestive of dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements are typically patterned and twisting and may be tremulous. The condition is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation. In this case, the patient's dystonia is likely secondary to the administration of haloperidol, a high-potency, first-generation antipsychotic. Antipsychotic agents block postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia, which can lead to an imbalance of activity favoring the cholinergic system. This can result in acute dystonia within hours to days of drug administration or dose increase. Acute dystonia can manifest as torticollis (twisting of the neck), as seen in this patient, or other forms such as oculogyric crisis, trismus, oromandibular dystonia, or even life-threatening laryngospasm. Treatment involves discontinuation of the offending drug and administration of an anticholinergic agent such as benztropine or diphenhydramine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
