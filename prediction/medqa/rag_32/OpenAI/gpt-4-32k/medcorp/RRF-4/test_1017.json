    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain, along with the physical findings of a holosystolic heart murmur and non-tender erythematous lesions on his palms and soles, are suggestive of infective endocarditis. The presence of vegetations on the mitral valve confirmed by echocardiography further supports this diagnosis. The patient's recent history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a colonoscopy report suggestive of colorectal cancer is important, as certain organisms are associated with infective endocarditis in the setting of gastrointestinal malignancy. Streptococcus bovis is known to be associated with colorectal cancer and can cause infective endocarditis. The other options, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus aphrophilus, can also cause infective endocarditis, but they are not specifically associated with colorectal cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
