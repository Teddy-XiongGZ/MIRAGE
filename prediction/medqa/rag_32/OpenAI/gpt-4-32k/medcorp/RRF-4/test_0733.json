    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of projectile vomiting after every feeding, along with the physical exam finding of an olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region, are classic for pyloric stenosis. This condition is characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. The persistent vomiting can lead to loss of gastric acid, which is rich in hydrogen ions. This loss can result in a metabolic alkalosis, characterized by an increase in blood bicarbonate concentration and an increase in blood pH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metabolic alkalosis\"}"
