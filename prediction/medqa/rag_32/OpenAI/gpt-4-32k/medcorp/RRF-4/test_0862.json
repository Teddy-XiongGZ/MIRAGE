Her physical exam is normal, but her blood pressure is elevated. The question asks for the best next step in management. Looking at the options, A. Colonoscopy is not typically recommended until age 50 unless there is a strong family history of colon cancer or a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, neither of which this patient has. B. Discontinuing birth control and placing an intrauterine device is not indicated as the patient is not complaining of any issues with her current birth control. C. Pap smear is not needed as the patient had one a year ago and current guidelines recommend a Pap smear every 3 years for women aged 21-65. D. Recommending weight loss is not appropriate as the patient's BMI is within the normal range. However, the patient's blood pressure is elevated, which is concerning for hypertension. The best next step would be to address this issue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
