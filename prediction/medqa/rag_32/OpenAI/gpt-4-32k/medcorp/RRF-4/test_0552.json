    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice, along with laboratory findings of leukocytosis and cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels), are consistent with ascending cholangitis. This condition is a serious infection of the biliary tract that typically arises due to obstruction, most commonly from gallstones. The ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder further support this diagnosis. The initial management of ascending cholangitis includes hemodynamic resuscitation, antibiotics, and urgent biliary decompression. Given the patient's worsening mental status (indicating severe disease), emergent biliary decompression is required. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the preferred method of biliary decompression in ascending cholangitis because it allows for both diagnostic visualization and therapeutic intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
