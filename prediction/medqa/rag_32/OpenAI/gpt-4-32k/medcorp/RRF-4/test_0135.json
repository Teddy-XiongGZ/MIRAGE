    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where CD8 positive cells are mixed with infected cells and then a protein bound to CD8 is identified. CD8 is a co-receptor for the T-cell receptor and is known to bind to MHC class I molecules. MHC class I molecules present endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel to the cell surface. Therefore, the protein that was most likely identified is one that binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
