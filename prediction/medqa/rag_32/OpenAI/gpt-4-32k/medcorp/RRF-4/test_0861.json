    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of an upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, jaundice, and splenomegaly, along with the laboratory findings of anemia and a negative Coombs test, suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. This is a genetic disorder of the red blood cell membrane that causes the cells to become sphere-shaped, rather than the normal biconcave disk shape, making them more prone to hemolysis. The peripheral blood smear would likely show spherocytes. One of the most common complications of hereditary spherocytosis is the formation of gallstones (cholelithiasis), which can lead to cholecystitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cholecystitis\"}"
