    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a family where multiple members have similar symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough, and the elderly woman has been confirmed to have a viral infection with a helical capsid and a segmented genome. This description is consistent with an influenza virus, which is known to have these characteristics. The son, living in the same household, is asymptomatic despite the ongoing outbreak in his family. The most likely explanation for this is that he has immunity against the virus. The immunity against influenza virus is primarily mediated by serum antibodies against hemagglutinin, a major surface antigen of the influenza virus that is responsible for binding the virus to the host cell. Therefore, the son is most likely free of symptoms due to the presence of serum antibodies against hemagglutinin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
