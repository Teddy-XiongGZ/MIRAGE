    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of a large, firm, immobile, and tender mass over the right mandible, along with the histopathologic image showing a starry-sky appearance, is suggestive of Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.
