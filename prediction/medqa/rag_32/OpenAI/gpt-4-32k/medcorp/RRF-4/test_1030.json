    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn in the question has features of a congenital syndrome, including micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, small, low-set ears, a cleft palate, and a heart murmur suggestive of a congenital heart defect. The mother's history of lithium use early in pregnancy is significant, as lithium is associated with a specific congenital syndrome known as DiGeorge syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by conotruncal cardiac anomalies, such as the one described in the question (a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart), as well as facial anomalies and hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this newborn would be low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum, which is associated with DiGeorge syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
