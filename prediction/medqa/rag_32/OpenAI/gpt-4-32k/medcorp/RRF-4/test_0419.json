    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of large purpura, hemorrhagic bullae, and areas of skin necrosis over his anterior legs, gluteal region, and penis after starting treatment with warfarin is suggestive of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. This is a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy that typically occurs within the first few days of treatment. It is thought to result from a rapid decrease in protein C levels, which is a natural anticoagulant. This creates a transient hypercoagulable state leading to thrombosis of the small and medium-sized vessels of the dermis and subcutaneous fat, causing skin necrosis. The treatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis involves discontinuation of warfarin and administration of vitamin K. In severe cases, protein C concentrates can be used to replace the deficient protein and reverse the hypercoagulable state.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Protein C concentrate\"}"
