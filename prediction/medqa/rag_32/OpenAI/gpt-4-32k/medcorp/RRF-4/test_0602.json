    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the interaction between rifampin, an antibiotic, and oral contraceptive pills. Rifampin is known to induce certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including oral contraceptives. This induction can lead to increased metabolism and decreased effectiveness of these contraceptives. Therefore, the use of additional contraception is recommended during and for a certain period after rifampin therapy. The mechanism that best explains this is that rifampin induces CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins, leading to decreased effectiveness of the contraceptive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
