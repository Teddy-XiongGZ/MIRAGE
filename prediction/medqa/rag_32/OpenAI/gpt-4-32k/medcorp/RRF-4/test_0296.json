    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a pigmented lesion that has been slowly growing in size and is confirmed to contain neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. This suggests a type of skin cancer, likely melanoma. Document [30] describes the characteristics of different types of melanoma. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common variant and often presents as a change in color or size. Nodular melanomas are described as dark brown-black to blue-black nodules. Lentigo maligna melanoma usually occurs in sun-damaged sites, which could include the neck of a fisherman. Acral lentiginous melanoma occurs on the palms, soles, nail beds, and mucous membranes, which doesn't match the patient's presentation. Desmoplastic melanoma is associated with a fibrotic response, neural invasion, and a greater tendency for local recurrence.
