    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of fever, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, and clonus is suggestive of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by an excess of serotonin in the brain. This can occur due to an overdose of serotonergic drugs or a combination of such drugs. The patient's history reveals that she has been taking citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), for her major depressive disorder. SSRIs can increase serotonin levels and potentially lead to serotonin syndrome, especially when combined with other serotonergic agents. The patient also started taking an amino acid supplement recently. If this supplement contains tryptophan, it could contribute to increased serotonin production. However, SSRIs are more commonly associated with serotonin syndrome than dietary supplements. The patient's new low-carbohydrate diet is unlikely to cause serotonin syndrome. While diet can influence serotonin levels, a low-carbohydrate diet would not typically cause an excessive increase in serotonin. Lastly, there is no indication in the patient's history that she has been abusing opiates, which are not typically associated with serotonin syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Medication change\"}"
