    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of intermittent headaches and wet shirts suggest a possible pituitary tumor causing an overproduction of prolactin, which would lead to galactorrhea (unexpected lactation, hence the wet shirts) and headaches due to the mass effect of the tumor. The visual disturbances leading to the near-miss car accidents could be due to compression of the optic chiasm, which is located superior to the pituitary gland, causing bitemporal hemianopsia. Therefore, the elevated circulating substance is likely prolactin. Prolactin inhibits the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, which in turn decreases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. This leads to decreased progesterone levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decreased progesterone\"}"
