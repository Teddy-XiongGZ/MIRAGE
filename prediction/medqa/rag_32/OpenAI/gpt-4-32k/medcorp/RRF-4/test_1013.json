    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of symmetric joint pain, morning stiffness that improves with activity, and fatigue are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis. This is a chronic inflammatory disorder that typically affects the small joints in the hands and feet. It is characterized by painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is usually a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) to reduce or prevent joint damage. Methotrexate is a DMARD that is often used as first-line therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Infliximab and anakinra are also DMARDs, but they are usually used for patients who do not respond to methotrexate. High-dose prednisone for 60 days is not typically a first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, although corticosteroids like prednisone may be used for short-term symptom relief.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
