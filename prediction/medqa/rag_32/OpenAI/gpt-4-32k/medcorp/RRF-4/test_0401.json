The options for emergency contraception include copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD), ulipristal acetate, and levonorgestrel. Mifepristone is not used for emergency contraception. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is a long-term contraceptive method and is not used for emergency contraception. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception and can be left in place for long-term contraception.
