    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of nipple discharge and diminished sexual drive suggest hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by certain medications. Haloperidol, fluphenazine, and risperidone are all antipsychotic medications that can increase prolactin levels, leading to symptoms such as galactorrhea and decreased libido. Bromocriptine, on the other hand, is a dopamine agonist used to treat conditions like Parkinson's disease and hyperprolactinemia itself. It works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain, which inhibits prolactin release. Therefore, bromocriptine would not be expected to cause the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
