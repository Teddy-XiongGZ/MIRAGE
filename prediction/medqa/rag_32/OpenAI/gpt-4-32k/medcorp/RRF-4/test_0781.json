    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand that Northern blotting is used to detect RNA, Southern blotting is used to detect DNA, and Western blotting is used to detect proteins. In the context of the question, we are interested in detecting HIF-1\u03b1, which is a protein. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and C because they involve Northern and Southern blotting, which are not appropriate for detecting proteins. This leaves us with option D, which involves Western blotting. This method would indeed show increased HIF-1\u03b1 in RCC under normoxic conditions compared to a normoxic control, because RCC can mimic the hypoxic state and prevent the degradation of HIF-1\u03b1, leading to its accumulation even under normoxic conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
