    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a low platelet count, also known as thrombocytopenia, which is a common side effect of chemotherapy. This can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and bruising, as platelets are essential for blood clotting. To manage chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, a recombinant version of a growth factor that stimulates the production of platelets in the bone marrow can be used. Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is a thrombopoietic growth factor that has been shown to stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis and increase platelet production. Therefore, recombinant IL-11 would be the most appropriate choice in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
