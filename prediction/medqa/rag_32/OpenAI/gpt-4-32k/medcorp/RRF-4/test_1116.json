    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of widespread pain, fatigue, and poor sleep are suggestive of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. It is often associated with sleep disturbances, morning stiffness, irritable bowel syndrome, and mood disorders. The diagnosis is clinical, based on the presence of widespread pain for at least 3 months and the presence of 11 out of 18 specific tender points on physical examination. However, the tender point examination has been deemphasized in recent years. The patient's normal laboratory findings are consistent with fibromyalgia, as there are no specific laboratory abnormalities associated with this condition. The first-line treatment for fibromyalgia includes patient education, exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. If these measures are insufficient, pharmacologic therapy may be added. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is commonly used and can help improve sleep and reduce pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Amitriptyline\"}"
