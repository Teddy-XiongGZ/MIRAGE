    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe headache, transient vision loss, blurry vision, and tinnitus, along with her history of obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome, suggest a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. This condition is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, often presenting with symptoms similar to those of a brain tumor but without an actual tumor. The normal head CT scan further supports this diagnosis, as IIH typically does not show abnormalities on CT. The best next step in management would be a lumbar puncture, which can confirm the diagnosis by showing elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure and can also provide therapeutic relief by removing excess fluid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lumbar puncture\"}"
