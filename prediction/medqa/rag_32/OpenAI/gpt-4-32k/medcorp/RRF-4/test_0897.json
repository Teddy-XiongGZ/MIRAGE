    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of leg swelling, difficulty walking, and proteinuria suggest nephrotic syndrome, likely secondary to lupus nephritis given her history of systemic lupus erythematosus. The new symptom of hematuria and the cystoscopy findings of diffuse bladder mucosa oozing and neovascularization suggest hemorrhagic cystitis. Hemorrhagic cystitis is a known side effect of cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressant that is often used in the treatment of lupus nephritis. Mesna is a medication that is used to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Therefore, the use of mesna could have potentially prevented the patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
