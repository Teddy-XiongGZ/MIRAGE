    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of jaundice, scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, and direct hyperbilirubinemia suggests a posthepatic cause of jaundice. The most common cause of direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia in neonates is biliary atresia, an obstruction of the biliary tree leading to cholestasis. This condition typically presents in the first few weeks of life with jaundice, acholic (pale) stools, and dark urine. The liver may initially be normal-sized or enlarged, and over time, there may be development of firm hepatomegaly and splenomegaly due to portal hypertension. The other options are less likely: Galactosemia typically presents with poor feeding, vomiting, and failure to thrive within days of milk ingestion. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a genetic disorder causing unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Breast milk jaundice typically presents in the first or second week of life and is a form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
