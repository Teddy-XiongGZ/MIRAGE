    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a lung nodule that has grown from 8 mm to 10 mm over the course of a year. The nodule has regular margins and appears calcified, which are characteristics that could suggest a benign lesion. However, the growth of the nodule over time is concerning for malignancy. A PET scan could help determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which would suggest malignancy. A bronchoscopy-guided biopsy would provide a definitive diagnosis. Given the growth of the nodule, it would be appropriate to pursue further diagnostic evaluation rather than simply monitoring the nodule with another CT scan in 24 months. A right middle lobectomy would be a treatment option if the nodule is confirmed to be malignant, but it would be premature to proceed with this invasive procedure without a definitive diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy now\"}"
