    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise suggest a cardiovascular issue. The physical examination findings of wide splitting of S2 and a loud second component of S2 best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space are indicative of pulmonary hypertension, which increases the right ventricular afterload. This is because the second heart sound (S2) is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. A loud and widely split S2 typically suggests delayed closure of the pulmonic valve, which can be caused by conditions that prolong right ventricular systolic ejection, such as pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings is increased right ventricular afterload.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased right ventricular afterload\"}"
