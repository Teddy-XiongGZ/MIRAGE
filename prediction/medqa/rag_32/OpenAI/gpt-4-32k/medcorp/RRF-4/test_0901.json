    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 13 weeks pregnant and presents with profuse bleeding, dizziness, and weakness. Her blood pressure is low, and her pulse is high, indicating potential hypovolemic shock due to blood loss. The ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity with no fetal movement or cardiac activity, suggesting a non-viable pregnancy. The slight downward migration of the gestational sac and the open cervical os indicate a likely miscarriage. In this case, the next step in management would be to remove the non-viable pregnancy tissue from the uterus to prevent further bleeding and infection. This is typically done through a procedure called dilation and curettage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
