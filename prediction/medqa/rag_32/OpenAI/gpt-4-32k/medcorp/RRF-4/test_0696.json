    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a molecule or receptor that can increase insulin sensitivity. Catecholamines, glucagon, and glucocorticoids are all hormones that increase blood glucose levels, so they would not increase insulin sensitivity. On the other hand, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis. Activation of PPAR-gamma improves insulin sensitivity, making it the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
