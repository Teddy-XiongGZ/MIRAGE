    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include fluent speech, normal comprehension, and difficulty with repetition, which are indicative of conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a bundle of fibers that connects Broca's area in the frontal lobe (responsible for speech production) and Wernicke's area in the superior temporal gyrus (responsible for speech comprehension). The arcuate fasciculus is supplied by the left middle cerebral artery, which also supplies both Broca's and Wernicke's areas in the dominant cerebral hemisphere (left hemisphere in about 95% of right-handed individuals and 70% of left-handed individuals). Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is occlusion of a branch of the left middle cerebral artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
