    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a complex ethical dilemma. The patient is in a comatose state and unable to make decisions for himself. His daughter, who is presumably his next of kin, is refusing a life-saving operation due to past abuse. However, the physician has a duty to act in the best interest of the patient. In such cases, it is often best to seek legal advice or refer the case to a court to make a decision. Reporting the daughter to the police would not be appropriate as she is not committing a crime by refusing consent. Contacting another family member for consent could be an option, but it would not resolve the ethical dilemma if the daughter is the legal next of kin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
