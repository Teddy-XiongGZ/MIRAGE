    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of hyperthermia, tachycardia, altered mental status, and muscle hypotonia is suggestive of a hyperthermic condition. Exertional heat stroke typically occurs in the setting of strenuous physical activity, but the patient's work as a construction worker could potentially cause this. However, the patient's history of schizophrenia and treatment with haloperidol makes neuroleptic malignant syndrome a strong possibility. Malignant hyperthermia is usually triggered by certain medications used during general anesthesia, but the patient's recent surgery was several months ago, making this less likely. Thyroid storm, a severe form of hyperthyroidism, could potentially cause these symptoms, but the patient is currently being treated for hyperthyroidism with propranolol. Given the patient's history and presentation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome seems the most likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
