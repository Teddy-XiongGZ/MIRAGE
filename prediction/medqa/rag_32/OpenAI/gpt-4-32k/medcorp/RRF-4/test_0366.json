    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of episodic chest pain described as squeezing and tightness, with transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely, suggest a diagnosis of Prinzmetal angina. Prinzmetal angina is caused by coronary artery spasm, which leads to transient ST-segment elevation on ECG during episodes of chest pain. The pain often occurs at rest, and not necessarily with exertion. The mechanism behind Prinzmetal angina is vasospasm, which is also the mechanism behind Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by episodic vasospasm in the fingers and toes, often in response to cold temperature or stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
