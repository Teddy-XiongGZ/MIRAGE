    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms started after the administration of epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia can cause hypotension due to sympathetic block, which leads to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Hypovolemia would be expected to present with tachycardia, not bradycardia. Acute pulmonary hypertension is not associated with the administration of epidural anesthesia. Aortocaval compression would be expected to present with hypotension when the patient is in the supine position, but this patient's hypotension developed after the administration of epidural anesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
