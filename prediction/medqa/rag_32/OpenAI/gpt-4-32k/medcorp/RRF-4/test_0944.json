    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has acute myelogenous leukemia and is showing symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is a group of metabolic complications that can occur after the treatment of cancer, most commonly after treatment of hematologic malignancies. These metabolic derangements include hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury. The patient's lab results show hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and an elevated creatinine level, which are all consistent with TLS. The most effective way to prevent TLS is through aggressive hydration, which helps to maintain urine output and allows for the excretion of potassium and phosphate. However, once TLS has developed, the most effective treatment is rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin, a more soluble and easily excreted product.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Rasburicase\"}"
