    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a process where a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same family. Within the host cell, the production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. The different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. This process is known as reassortment. Reassortment is a process that happens if two different types of influenza virus infect a single cell and it can produce a new strain of influenza. This is because the virus genome is split between eight independent pieces of RNA, which allows pieces of RNA from different viruses to mix and form a novel type of virus as new virus particles are being assembled. This process is common in segmented RNA viruses. Looking at the options, Rotavirus is a segmented RNA virus and is capable of undergoing reassortment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
