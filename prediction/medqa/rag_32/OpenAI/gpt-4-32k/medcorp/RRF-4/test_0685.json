    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure. According to Document [15], lung hysteresis is evident when observing the compliance of a lung on inspiration versus expiration. The transpulmonary pressure vs Volume curve of inhalation is different from the Pressure vs Volume curve of exhalation, the difference being described as hysteresis. Lung volume at any given pressure during inhalation is less than the lung volume at any given pressure during exhalation. This suggests that the dotted line in the graph corresponds to the lung volume during exhalation, which is the functional residual capacity (FRC). FRC is the volume of air present in the lungs at the end of passive expiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Functional residual capacity\"}"
