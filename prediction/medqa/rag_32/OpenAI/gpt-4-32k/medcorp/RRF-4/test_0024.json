    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient initially presented with an asthma exacerbation, which was treated appropriately with bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids. However, instead of improving, the patient became lethargic and his respiratory rate decreased, suggesting impending respiratory failure. The absence of wheezing, which was initially present, is concerning for severe airflow obstruction. In such cases, breath sounds may be diminished or absent despite severe bronchospasm due to markedly reduced airflow. The most appropriate next step in management is endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to secure the airway and ensure adequate gas exchange.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
