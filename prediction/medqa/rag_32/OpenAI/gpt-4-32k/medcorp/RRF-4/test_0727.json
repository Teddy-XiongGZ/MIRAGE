    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of episodic fever, night sweats, and weight loss are suggestive of a systemic illness such as an infection, autoimmune disease, or malignancy. The presence of cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and mediastinal masses on chest x-ray further suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder. The question stem does not provide the photomicrograph of the resected specimen, but based on the clinical presentation, we can infer that it likely shows features of a lymphoma. The answer choices provided are all associated with different types of lymphomas or leukemias. CD15 and CD30 positivity is characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma, BCR-ABL rearrangement is seen in chronic myeloid leukemia, Bcl-2 overexpression is associated with follicular lymphoma, and t(8;14) chromosomal translocation is seen in Burkitt lymphoma. Given the patient's age, the presence of systemic symptoms, and the pattern of lymphadenopathy, Hodgkin lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
