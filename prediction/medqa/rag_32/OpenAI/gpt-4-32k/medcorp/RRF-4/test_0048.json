    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had an uncomplicated pregnancy until 35 weeks' gestation, when she was admitted to the hospital in labor. Fetal heartbeats could not be detected, and ultrasound showed no signs of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The infant was stillborn with no visible malformations. The placenta was unremarkable. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an autopsy of the infant. An autopsy can provide valuable information about the cause of the fetal demise, which can guide counseling and management in future pregnancies. Karyotyping of amniotic fluid, obtaining photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI, and parental genetic testing may not provide immediate or definitive information about the cause of the fetal demise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
