    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of heavy and irregular periods, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a 'heavy feeling' in the pelvis, and increased urinary frequency suggest a gynecological issue. Given her age and the fact that she has had multiple pregnancies, a common cause of these symptoms could be uterine fibroids, which would result in an enlarged, irregular uterus. An adnexal mass would be less likely as it typically presents with different symptoms, such as sharp or dull pelvic pain. A globular 10-week sized uterus is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and history. The option of no remarkable physical exam finding is unlikely given the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
