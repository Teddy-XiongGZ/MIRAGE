    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with signs of shock (tachycardia and hypotension) and peritonitis (abdominal rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness on light percussion) following a motor vehicle accident. The sonography shows evidence of hemoperitoneum, indicating internal bleeding. Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient's hemodynamics have not improved, suggesting ongoing blood loss. A CT scan would further delay definitive treatment and morphine would only address the pain, not the underlying issue. More fluids are unlikely to correct the problem given the lack of response to initial fluid resuscitation. Therefore, the best next step is exploratory laparotomy to identify and control the source of bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
