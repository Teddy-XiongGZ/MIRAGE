    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of a motor vehicle collision, chest pain, and bruising over his chest wall suggests a traumatic injury. The elevated troponins and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure indicate cardiac involvement. Cardiac contusion, a condition caused by blunt chest trauma, fits this clinical picture. Hemorrhage would likely present with signs of shock, which are not prominent in this case. Pulmonary contusion would likely present with respiratory symptoms, which are also not prominent in this case. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, which does not fit this clinical picture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
