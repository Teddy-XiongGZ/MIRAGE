    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history of contact lens use suggest a diagnosis of bacterial keratitis, a serious ocular infection that can lead to corneal scarring and vision loss if not promptly treated. Contact lens wear, especially extended wear, is the most common risk factor for bacterial keratitis. The most common pathogens are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus that does not ferment lactose. It is the most common cause of contact lens-related bacterial keratitis because it can adhere to the contact lens and subsequently to the corneal epithelium. Therefore, the culture of the ocular discharge is most likely to show gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
