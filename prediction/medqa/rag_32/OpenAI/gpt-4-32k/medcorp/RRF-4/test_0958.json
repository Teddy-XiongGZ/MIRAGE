    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss, along with the physical examination findings of dry skin, a pustular rash, and distal loss of vibration sensitivity in both feet, are suggestive of diabetes mellitus. The HbA1c level of 9% confirms this diagnosis, as it is above the diagnostic threshold of 6.5%. The urinalysis shows glucosuria, which is the presence of glucose in the urine. This is a common finding in diabetes mellitus and occurs when the blood glucose levels are so high that the renal tubules are unable to reabsorb all the filtered glucose, leading to its presence in the urine. This is not due to a disruption of the transport mechanisms, but rather an overload of the system due to hyperglycemia. Therefore, the best answer choice is B, which states that secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
