    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of bilateral knee pain that worsens with activity, minimal morning stiffness, and physical examination findings of tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees, crepitus, decreased range of motion, and bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line are suggestive of osteoarthritis. According to Document [2], the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is complex due to a lack of specific physical and/or laboratorial findings. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has recommended using the following criteria for the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis: chronic knee pain (lasting for more than 6 weeks) and at least three of the following: Age over 50 years old, Morning knee stiffness lasting up to 30 minutes, Crepitus with active motion, Tenderness on bony palpation, Thickening or growth of the bones, No local heat on palpation. The patient meets these criteria. Therefore, no further work-up is needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. No further work-up needed\"}"
