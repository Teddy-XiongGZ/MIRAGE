    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most likely lymphatic route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain. The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs that help rid the body of toxins, waste, and other unwanted materials. It is a part of the immune system and helps fight infections. The primary function of the lymphatic system is to transport lymph, a fluid containing infection-fighting white blood cells, throughout the body. The lymphatic system consists of lymphatic vessels, which are similar to the veins and capillaries of the circulatory system. The vessels are connected to lymph nodes, where the lymph is filtered. The tonsils, adenoids, spleen, and thymus are all part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic drainage of the ovaries is via the lumbar lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The cisterna chyli drains into the thoracic duct, which empties into the left subclavian vein. From there, the cancer cells can enter the systemic circulation and metastasize to distant sites, including the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation\"}"
