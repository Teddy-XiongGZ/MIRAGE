    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of fever, right upper quadrant pain, and a tender, enlarged liver in the setting of diabetes mellitus is suggestive of a liver abscess. The abdominal ultrasonography likely confirms this diagnosis, showing a hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Although Entamoeba histolytica can cause liver abscesses, it is more commonly seen in developing countries and is associated with a history of travel to endemic areas, which this patient does not have. Furthermore, the patient's stool is negative for E. histolytica antigen. Therefore, a pyogenic liver abscess, most commonly due to gram-negative enteric bacteria, is more likely. The best initial management of a pyogenic liver abscess is with antibiotics that cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes, such as a third-generation cephalosporin (eg, ceftriaxone) plus metronidazole. In addition to antibiotics, abscesses >5 cm or those not responding to antibiotics typically require drainage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Antibiotics and drainage\"}"
