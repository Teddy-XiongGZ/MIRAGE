The scaphoid bone is located in the anatomical snuffbox, which is tender in this patient. Scaphoid fractures can sometimes be missed on initial x-rays, so if there is a high clinical suspicion, the patient should be treated as if they have a scaphoid fracture and repeat x-rays should be done in 2 weeks. The most appropriate management is immobilization in a thumb spica cast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
