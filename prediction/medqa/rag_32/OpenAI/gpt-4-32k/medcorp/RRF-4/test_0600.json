    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers during vaccine development. From the documents, it is clear that capsular polysaccharides on their own are not highly immunogenic, especially in infants. However, when these polysaccharides are conjugated to a protein carrier, it transforms the antigen into a T-dependent one, which can induce a more robust immune response, even in infants. Therefore, the best answer is that conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
