    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman's brother has symptoms that are consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize phenylalanine. PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, to manifest the disease. The woman's parents are both healthy, suggesting they are likely carriers of the PKU gene, each carrying one normal and one defective copy. As the child of two carriers, the woman has a 50% chance of being a carrier (inheriting one defective gene), a 25% chance of being affected (inheriting two defective genes), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier (inheriting two normal genes). However, since the woman does not have symptoms of PKU, we can rule out the possibility that she is affected. Therefore, her chance of being a carrier is 2/3 or approximately 67%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
