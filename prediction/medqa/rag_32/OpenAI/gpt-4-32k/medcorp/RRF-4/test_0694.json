    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of malaise, fatigue, sore throat, fever, splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy, along with the laboratory findings of elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes, and a positive heterophile antibody screen, are indicative of infectious mononucleosis, most commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. The management of infectious mononucleosis is primarily supportive, as the condition is self-limiting and usually resolves on its own. Bed rest and activity limitation are recommended to manage symptoms and prevent complications such as splenic rupture. Antiviral medications like ganciclovir are not typically used in the treatment of infectious mononucleosis. Amoxicillin is not recommended because it can cause a rash in patients with infectious mononucleosis. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, is not typically used unless complications such as airway obstruction or severe thrombocytopenia occur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
