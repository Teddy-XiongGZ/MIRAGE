    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and episodes of unsteadiness suggest a sensorineural hearing loss, which is common in the elderly. The Weber test, where a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead, is heard equally in both ears, indicating that there is no lateralization of sound, which is normal. The Rinne test, where the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, shows that air conduction is greater than bone conduction, which is also normal. These findings suggest that the problem is not in the conductive apparatus of the ear (tympanic membrane, malleus, incus), but rather in the cochlea, which is responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Cochlea\"}"
