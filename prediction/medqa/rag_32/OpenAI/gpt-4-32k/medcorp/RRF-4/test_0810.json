    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's lab results show a normal hemoglobin level, MCV, and platelet count. However, the presence of spherocytes in the peripheral blood smear, along with a negative Coombs test, suggests a non-immune hemolytic anemia. The moderate splenomegaly and scleral icterus further support this diagnosis. The most common cause of non-immune hemolytic anemia is hereditary spherocytosis. The Eosin-5-maleimide binding test is a flow cytometry test that is used to confirm a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Therefore, this would be the most appropriate diagnostic test for this patient's underlying disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
