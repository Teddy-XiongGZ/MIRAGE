    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea are indicative of a myocardial infarction. The imaging further confirms this diagnosis, showing a transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum is typically supplied by the septal perforators, which are branches of the left anterior descending artery. However, the question asks for the most likely occluded artery in this specific case, where the infarction is in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. This area is typically supplied by the posterior descending artery, which is a branch of the right coronary artery in about 85% of individuals (right-dominant circulation) and a branch of the left circumflex artery in the remaining 15% (left-dominant circulation). Given that right-dominant circulation is more common, the right coronary artery is the most likely to be occluded in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Right main\"}"
