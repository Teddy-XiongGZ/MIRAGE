    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node. This could be a sign of malignancy, as the left supraclavicular node (also known as Virchow's node) is a common site for metastasis from various cancers, particularly those in the abdomen, such as gastric cancer. Given the patient's history of smoking, a chest radiograph would be useful to rule out lung cancer. However, considering his ethnicity (Korean descent) and the location of the lymph node, gastric cancer should also be considered. Gastric cancer is more common in East Asian countries, including Korea. Therefore, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy would be a reasonable choice to evaluate for possible gastric cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Upper gastointestinal endoscopy\"}"
