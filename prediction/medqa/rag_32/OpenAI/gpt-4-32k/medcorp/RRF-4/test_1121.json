    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of double vision that occurs only when looking sideways, along with an adduction deficit in one eye and nystagmus in the other eye when looking to the side, are indicative of internuclear ophthalmoplegia. This condition is characterized by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, a bundle of nerve fibers that coordinates lateral gaze by connecting the abducens nucleus of one side to the oculomotor nucleus of the opposite side. The most common cause of internuclear ophthalmoplegia in a young person is demyelination, such as that seen in multiple sclerosis. A compressive tumor of the pons, oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency, and infarction of the brainstem are less likely given the patient's age, symptoms, and lack of other relevant clinical findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
