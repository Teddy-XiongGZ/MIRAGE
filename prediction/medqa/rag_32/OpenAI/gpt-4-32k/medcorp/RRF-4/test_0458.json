    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a healthy young man who has been running on a treadmill. After his run, his heart rate and blood pressure have increased. This is a normal physiological response to exercise. During exercise, the body needs to deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. To do this, the heart rate and blood pressure increase to pump more blood around the body. This is primarily driven by the sympathetic nervous system, which is part of the autonomic nervous system and is responsible for the 'fight or flight' response. The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate and blood pressure, among other things, to prepare the body for physical activity. Therefore, the sympathetic nervous system activation is most likely responsible for the change in his heart rate and blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
