    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation, along with physical examination findings of a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds, are indicative of bowel obstruction. The x-ray findings of a dilated bowel and multiple air-fluid levels further support this diagnosis. The presence of branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region suggests the presence of gas in the biliary tree, which is known as pneumobilia. Pneumobilia most commonly occurs as a result of an abnormal connection (fistula) between the biliary tract and the gastrointestinal tract, or following biliary tract instrumentation. In this patient, the most likely cause of both the bowel obstruction and the pneumobilia is a gallstone that has passed into the gastrointestinal tract through a cholecystoenteric fistula and then impacted in the ileum causing obstruction, a condition known as gallstone ileus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Obstruction of the common bile duct\"}"
