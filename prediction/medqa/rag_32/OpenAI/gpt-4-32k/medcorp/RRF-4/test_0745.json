    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of lightheadedness after hemodialysis sessions and a drop in blood pressure from lying down to sitting up suggest intradialytic hypotension. This is a common complication of hemodialysis and can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. The patient's fear of falling is valid as hypotension can lead to dizziness and falls. The patient's diabetes and end-stage renal disease further complicate her condition. Looking at the options, cooling the dialysate is a known method to reduce the risk of intradialytic hypotension. Eating heavier meals during dialysis can actually increase the risk of hypotension. Increasing ultrafiltration would likely exacerbate the hypotension. Steroid administration is not typically used to manage intradialytic hypotension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
