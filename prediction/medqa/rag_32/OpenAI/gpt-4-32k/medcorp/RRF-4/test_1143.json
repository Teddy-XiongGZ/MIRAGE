    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's older brother died from heart failure and his nephew has severe muscle weakness, suggesting a genetic disorder. However, the patient and his mother are not affected, which rules out autosomal dominant inheritance. Since the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation, it is unlikely that the disease is autosomal recessive. The fact that the patient's brother and nephew are affected while he is not, suggests that the mutation might have occurred in the germ cells of one of his parents. This is known as gonadal mosaicism, where a mutation occurs in the germ cells but not in the somatic cells of an individual. Therefore, the individual does not show signs of the disease but can pass the mutation to their offspring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
