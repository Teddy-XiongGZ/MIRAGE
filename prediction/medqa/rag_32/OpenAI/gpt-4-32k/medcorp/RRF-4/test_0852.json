    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. This is typically caused by obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone. The patient's history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain after meals is suggestive of biliary colic, which occurs when a gallstone temporarily obstructs the cystic duct. The presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests that the current episode has progressed to inflammation and infection. The Murphy's sign (inspiratory arrest with palpation of the right upper quadrant) is a classic finding in acute cholecystitis. The ultrasound findings confirm the presence of gallstones and a dilated common bile duct, which are consistent with this diagnosis. The most appropriate next step in management is urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis because it addresses the underlying cause of the condition (the obstructing gallstone) and prevents complications such as gallbladder rupture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
