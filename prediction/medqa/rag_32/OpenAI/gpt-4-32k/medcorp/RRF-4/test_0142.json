    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling in her fingers and toes, decreased sensation to light touch in all distal extremities, and decreased knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are indicative of peripheral neuropathy. Given her recent treatment with vincristine, it is likely that her peripheral neuropathy is a side effect of this drug. Vincristine is known to cause peripheral neuropathy by inhibiting the polymerization of beta-tubulin, a protein that is essential for the formation of microtubules. Microtubules are important for axonal transport in neurons, and their disruption can lead to the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. The other options listed do not describe the mechanism of action of vincristine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
