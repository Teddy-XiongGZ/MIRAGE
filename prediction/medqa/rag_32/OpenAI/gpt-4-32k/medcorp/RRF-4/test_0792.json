    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is suffering from insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty initiating sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings. This is affecting her daily life, causing her to make mistakes at work and feel sleepy throughout the day. The question asks for the best pharmacological treatment for her insomnia. Chlordiazepoxide and Diazepam are both benzodiazepines, which can be used to treat insomnia, but they have a long half-life and can cause daytime sleepiness, which the patient is already experiencing. Modafinil is a stimulant used to treat sleep disorders like narcolepsy and sleep apnea, but it's not typically used for insomnia. Triazolam, on the other hand, is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is commonly used to treat insomnia. It helps to decrease the time to sleep onset and increases the duration of sleep.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Triazolam\"}"
