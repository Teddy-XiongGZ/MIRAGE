    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF), which is the proportion of all cases (in the total population) that can be attributed to the exposure. The formula for PAF is: PAF = [Pe(RR-1)] / [1+Pe(RR-1)], where Pe is the prevalence of the exposure (alcohol use) in the population and RR is the relative risk of the disease (GERD) in the exposed compared to the unexposed. From the data, Pe = 30% or 0.3. RR can be calculated as the incidence of GERD in alcoholics divided by the incidence of GERD in non-alcoholics, which is (30/200) / (30/400) = 2. Substituting these values into the PAF formula gives: PAF = [0.3(2-1)] / [1+0.3(2-1)] = 0.3 / 1.3 = 0.23. Therefore, if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town, approximately 23% of GERD cases could be prevented.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the choices\"}"
