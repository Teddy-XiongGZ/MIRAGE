    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis. It works by stimulating alpha and beta adrenergic receptors, which leads to vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and increased heart rate. However, the patient in this scenario is on propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker. This means that it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Beta-1 receptors are primarily found in the heart and when stimulated, they increase the heart rate. Therefore, blocking these receptors with propranolol generally leads to a decreased heart rate. Beta-2 receptors are found in the lungs and when stimulated, they cause bronchodilation. Therefore, blocking these receptors can lead to bronchoconstriction. However, in the case of anaphylaxis, epinephrine is administered which also stimulates alpha-1 receptors causing vasoconstriction and thus increasing blood pressure. This can counteract the effects of propranolol on the heart rate, leading to an increase rather than a decrease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased heart rate\"}"
