    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a complex ethical dilemma. The mother is concerned about her mentally challenged daughter's potential to become pregnant, which she believes her daughter would not be able to handle. However, the daughter is not able to fully understand the implications of the procedure or the consequences of sexual intercourse. The principle of autonomy suggests that patients should be able to make their own decisions about their healthcare, but in this case, the patient may not have the capacity to do so. The decision to perform a tubal ligation is a serious one, as it is a permanent form of contraception. It is not clear from the question whether the patient is sexually active or likely to become so, which would influence the risk of pregnancy. The best course of action would likely involve further discussions with the patient and her mother, potentially involving a mental health professional or an ethicist to help navigate this complex situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
