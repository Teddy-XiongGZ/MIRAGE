    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Trendelenburg gait, which is characterized by a drop of the contralateral pelvis when the patient stands on one leg. This is usually due to weakness or damage to the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, which are innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. The superior gluteal nerve exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, superior to the piriformis muscle, and it can be damaged by an injection administered to the superomedial quadrant of the buttock. Therefore, the vaccine injection likely damaged the superior gluteal nerve, leading to the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock\"}"
