    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-year-old female who has not yet menstruated, which is known as primary amenorrhea. She has normal secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner stage 5 for axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair), which suggests that her ovaries are producing estrogen. Her FSH and estradiol levels are within the normal range for the mid-follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, indicating that her hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is functioning. Her testosterone levels are also within the normal range, ruling out conditions associated with elevated testosterone such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Given these findings, the most likely cause of her primary amenorrhea is a structural abnormality of the reproductive tract. Since a complete vaginal examination was declined, we can't confirm the presence or absence of a vagina or cervix. However, the most common cause of primary amenorrhea in females with normal secondary sexual characteristics is Muellerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, which is characterized by congenital absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. Hyperprolactinemia typically presents with galactorrhea and can cause amenorrhea, but the patient does not have galactorrhea. Turner syndrome is characterized by short stature and lack of sexual development due to ovarian failure, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition in which a genetic male (46, XY) is resistant to androgens, leading to the development of female secondary sexual characteristics and primary amenorrhea. However, this condition would be associated with a lack of axillary and pubic hair, which is not the case in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
