    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of severe peanut allergy, recent food intake, and the sudden onset of symptoms such as facial edema, respiratory distress, and skin rash suggest an anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen. In this case, the allergen is likely to be peanuts. The first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine, which can rapidly reverse the symptoms. Oral diphenhydramine, a type of antihistamine, can be used to help relieve allergy symptoms, but it is not the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Topical diphenhydramine and inhaled sodium cromolyn are not appropriate treatments for anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
