    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with dysmenorrhea, which is painful menstruation. The pain is described as a dull ache in the center of her abdomen with accompanying back pain. The patient's mother has a history of endometriosis, which could potentially be a risk factor. However, the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to suggest endometriosis, as she does not report any bowel or bladder changes, and her physical exam is normal. The first line of treatment for dysmenorrhea is usually nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can help to reduce the production of prostaglandins, the chemicals that cause the uterus to contract and lead to pain. Therefore, the best next step would be to start the patient on NSAIDs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
