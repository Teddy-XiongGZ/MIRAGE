    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden onset of severe knee pain, redness, swelling, and warmth of the joint, along with fever. These symptoms are suggestive of an acute inflammatory process, most likely septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is a serious condition that can rapidly lead to joint destruction and systemic illness. It is typically characterized by a large number of white blood cells in the synovial fluid, predominantly polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), and decreased viscosity due to the inflammatory process. Therefore, the synovial fluid analysis in septic arthritis would likely show a high WBC count, a high percentage of PMNs, and low viscosity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
