    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells. When absorbed in tissue, ionizing radiation damages the DNA in cancer cells, which increases the probability of apoptosis (cell death). Normal cells are able to repair radiation damage, while cancer cells are not. This is how radiation therapy exploits to treat cancer. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one that mentions DNA damage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
