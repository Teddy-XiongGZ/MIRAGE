    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that there is an association between low education and the risk of MI. However, the confidence interval ranges from 0.9 to 9.7, which includes 1. In statistics, if the confidence interval for the odds ratio includes 1, it means that the association is not statistically significant. Therefore, although there seems to be an association based on the odds ratio, the wide confidence interval suggests that this association is not statistically significant. The p-value is not necessary to make this determination in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
