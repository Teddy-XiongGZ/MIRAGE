    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly don't have the disease. If the prevalence of the disease decreases, the proportion of true positive cases will decrease, leading to a decrease in PPV. On the other hand, the proportion of true negative cases will increase, leading to an increase in NPV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
