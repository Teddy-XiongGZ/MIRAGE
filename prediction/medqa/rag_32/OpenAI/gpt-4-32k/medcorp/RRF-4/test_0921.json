    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's blurry vision and fundoscopic findings of narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms are indicative of diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Poorly controlled blood sugar is a risk factor. Chronically high blood sugar from diabetes is associated with damage to the tiny blood vessels in the retina, leading to diabetic retinopathy. The retina detects light and converts it to signals sent through the optic nerve to the brain. The high blood sugar levels in diabetes often lead to increased sorbitol in cells, which can cause damage. Sorbitol dehydrogenase is the enzyme that converts sorbitol to fructose. In tissues such as the lens, retina, and kidneys, which have low levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase, sorbitol accumulates and causes osmotic damage, leading to cataracts, retinopathy, and nephropathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
