The most common genetic condition with these features is Turner syndrome, which is often associated with aortic coarctation and can lead to hypertension. However, this option is not given in the choices. The patient denies taking any medication, so oral contraceptive use can be ruled out. A neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland, such as a pheochromocytoma, could cause hypertension, but this is usually associated with symptoms such as headaches, sweating, and palpitations, which the patient does not report. Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension is a possibility, but it usually presents later in life and does not explain the patient's other symptoms.

Therefore, this seems to be the most likely cause given the choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
