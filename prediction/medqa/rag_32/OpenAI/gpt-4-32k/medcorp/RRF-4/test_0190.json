These symptoms, along with his increasing avoidance of leaving the house due to fear of having an attack in public, are indicative of panic disorder. The best long-term management for panic disorder is typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Citalopram is an SSRI and is commonly used in the treatment of panic disorder.
