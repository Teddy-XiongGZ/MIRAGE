    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thalassemia is a blood disorder that affects the body's ability to produce hemoglobin and red blood cells. The condition results in anemia, which can cause fatigue and other complications. Thalassemia intermedia is a type of thalassemia that is less severe than thalassemia major but more severe than thalassemia minor. According to the documents, a mutation in the Kozak sequence of the Beta-globin gene can lead to a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. This mutation decreases the efficiency of translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to a reduction in the production of Beta-globin chains. This would result in a lower production of hemoglobin and red blood cells. In terms of what would be seen on a blood smear, thalassemia typically results in microcytic red blood cells, which are smaller than normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
