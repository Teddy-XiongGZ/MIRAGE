    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of bilateral, low-amplitude tremor that worsens with movement and a family history of a similar condition suggest a diagnosis of essential tremor. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder that often affects the hands and arms, making it difficult to perform tasks that require fine motor skills. It is typically bilateral and is exacerbated by goal-directed activities. A family history of tremor is present in up to 50% of cases. First-line treatment for essential tremor includes nonselective beta-blockers such as propranolol. Levodopa and carbidopa therapy is used for Parkinson's disease, which typically presents with resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Deep brain stimulation and thalamotomy are invasive procedures reserved for severe, medication-refractory cases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Propranolol therapy\"}"
