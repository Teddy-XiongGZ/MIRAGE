    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of bruising and petechiae suggest a bleeding disorder. The normal complete blood count rules out thrombocytopenia, which is seen in conditions like immune thrombocytopenic purpura and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, so these can be ruled out. The coagulation profile shows a normal PT but a prolonged aPTT. This suggests a defect in the intrinsic or common pathway of coagulation. Von Willebrand disease typically presents with mucocutaneous bleeding and can cause a prolonged aPTT, but PT is usually normal. Hemophilia A, which is a deficiency of factor VIII (an intrinsic pathway factor), also presents with a similar bleeding pattern and coagulation profile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hemophilia A\"}"
