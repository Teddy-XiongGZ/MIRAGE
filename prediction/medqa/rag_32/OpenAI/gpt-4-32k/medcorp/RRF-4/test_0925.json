    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of recurrent bacterial infections, light-colored skin, silver-colored hair, and large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils, along with a mutation in the LYST gene, are all characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple systems, including the immune system and pigmentation. The other options do not match the patient's presentation and genetic findings. AIDS is caused by the HIV virus and would not present with the described skin and hair pigmentation changes. Common variable immunodeficiency typically presents later in life and does not cause changes in skin or hair pigmentation. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency\u20131 is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, delayed separation of the umbilical cord, and poor wound healing, but it does not cause the skin and hair pigmentation changes seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Chediak-Higashi syndrome\"}"
