    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident, given her sudden onset headache, nausea, and left-sided weakness. The prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) indicates a possible coagulation pathway abnormality. A mixing study can help differentiate between a factor deficiency (which would correct the aPTT) and an inhibitor (which would not correct the aPTT). Given the patient's history of recurrent spontaneous abortions, an acquired inhibitor of coagulation, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, could be a possibility. The other options (INR, ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test, clot retraction study) are not as directly relevant to the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
