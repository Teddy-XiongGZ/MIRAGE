    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with signs of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM), which is the rupture of membranes before 37 weeks' gestation. This is indicated by the clear vaginal discharge and positive Nitrazine test. The management of preterm PROM includes administration of corticosteroids, such as betamethasone, to accelerate fetal lung maturity and reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Antibiotics, such as ampicillin, are also given to prolong latency and reduce the risk of maternal and neonatal infection. However, the decision to proceed with induction of labor or cesarean section depends on the gestational age, fetal status, and maternal condition. In this case, the patient is only at 32 weeks' gestation, the fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations, and there are no maternal indications for immediate delivery. Therefore, expectant management is appropriate until 34 weeks' gestation unless labor ensues spontaneously or complications develop.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor\"}"
