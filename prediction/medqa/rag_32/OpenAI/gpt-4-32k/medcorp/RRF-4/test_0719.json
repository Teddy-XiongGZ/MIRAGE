    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme that is primarily found in erythrocytes and placental cells, as mentioned in Document [9]. None of the documents provided mention a relationship between bisphosphoglycerate mutase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glutathione reductase, or carbonic anhydrase. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that any of these enzymes would be absent in cells with an elevated concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
