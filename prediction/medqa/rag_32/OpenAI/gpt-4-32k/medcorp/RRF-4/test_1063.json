    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. It works by competing with acetylcholine for binding sites at the motor end plate. This prevents the depolarization of the motor end plate and inhibits the effect of acetylcholine, resulting in muscle relaxation and paralysis. Therefore, the role of atracurium in this patient\u2019s anesthesia is to induce muscle relaxation and paralysis to facilitate the surgical procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
