    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of dry mouth and dry eyes, along with the physical exam findings of tender parotid glands and dry mucous membranes, are suggestive of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. This is further supported by the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies, which are commonly associated with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Document [22] also describes a similar case of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to symptoms of dry mouth and dry eyes. Patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome are at an increased risk of developing lymphoma, as mentioned in Document [5]. Therefore, the patient is most at risk for developing Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the future.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\"}"
