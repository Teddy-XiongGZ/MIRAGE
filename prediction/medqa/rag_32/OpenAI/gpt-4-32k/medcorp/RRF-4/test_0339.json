    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are indicative of a specific phobia, in this case, arachnophobia. This is characterized by an intense, irrational fear of a specific object or situation that leads to avoidance behavior. The most effective treatment for specific phobias is exposure therapy, a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that involves gradual and repeated exposure to the feared object or situation until the fear response decreases. This is also known as desensitization. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used for hypertension and heart conditions, not for phobias. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety disorders, but it is not the first-line treatment for specific phobias. Psychotherapy can be helpful, but exposure therapy (desensitization) is the most effective treatment for specific phobias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
