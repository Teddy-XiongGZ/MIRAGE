    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and ankle swelling, along with the physical findings of bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema, widely split S2 that varies with respiration, and right bundle branch block on ECG, suggest a cardiac issue. The widely split S2 that varies with respiration and right bundle branch block are indicative of right-sided heart issues, possibly right-sided heart failure. In right-sided heart failure, the heart is unable to effectively pump blood to the lungs, leading to a buildup of blood in the veins. This increases the pressure in the veins, which can force fluid out of the veins and into the surrounding tissues, causing edema. This process is described as an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
