    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue and dark urine, along with a history of similar episodes since birth, suggest a chronic condition rather than an acute one. This makes bacterial infection and food less likely as causes. The fact that the patient's symptoms have occurred since birth also makes it less likely that his diabetes or the medication for it, which were only introduced 5 years ago and 1 week ago respectively, are the cause. However, the patient's recent start on glipizide, a medication known to cause changes in urine color, could potentially be a contributing factor. The term 'idiopathic' refers to conditions with an unknown cause, which could be a possibility given the patient's lifelong history of these episodes. However, the recent change in medication seems to be a more likely cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Medication\"}"
