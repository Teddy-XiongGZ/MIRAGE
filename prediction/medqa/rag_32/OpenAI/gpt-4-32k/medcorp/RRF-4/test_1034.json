    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms started after a rhinoplasty procedure, which suggests that the cause is related to the surgery. Post-operative swelling (Choice A) would likely cause nasal obstruction rather than a whistling noise. A deviated septum that is now straight (Choice C) could potentially alter nasal airflow, but it would not typically cause a whistling noise. Excessive columellar show (Choice D) could potentially increase nasal airflow, but it would not typically cause a whistling noise. A septal hematoma causing a perforation (Choice B), however, could create a small hole in the nasal septum, which could cause a whistling noise when air passes through it during respiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
