    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.28, which indicates acidosis, and a bicarbonate level of 14 mEq/L, which is lower than the normal range (22-28 mEq/L), suggesting a primary metabolic acidosis. The urine pH is 7.0, which is relatively high given the systemic acidosis, indicating a renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The normal anion gap (Na - (Cl + HCO3) = 136 - (115 + 14) = 7 mEq/L) suggests a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is consistent with RTA. Among the options, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is known to cause type 4 RTA by impairing ammonium excretion, which can lead to hyperkalemia. However, this patient has normal serum sodium and low serum potassium levels, which is not consistent with type 4 RTA. Amphotericin B can cause renal tubular acidosis, specifically type 1 or distal RTA, by impairing hydrogen ion secretion in the distal nephron. This leads to a failure to acidify the urine in the setting of metabolic acidosis, which matches this patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Amphotericin B\"}"
