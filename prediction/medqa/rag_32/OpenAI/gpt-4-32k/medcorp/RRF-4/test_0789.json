    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden onset palpitations followed by loss of consciousness, along with the telemetry showing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, suggest a cardiac arrhythmia as the cause of his syncope. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, as well as his current treatment for pneumonia, could potentially contribute to electrolyte imbalances such as hypomagnesemia or hyperkalemia, which can cause arrhythmias. However, Brugada syndrome and prolonged QT interval are also known to cause ventricular tachycardia and syncope. Given the specific finding of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, the most likely cause is a prolonged QT interval, which is known to cause this specific type of arrhythmia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
