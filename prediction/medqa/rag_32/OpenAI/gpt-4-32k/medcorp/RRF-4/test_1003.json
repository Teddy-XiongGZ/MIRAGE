    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of flushing, diarrhea, and palpitations, along with the finding of increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, suggest a diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. This syndrome is caused by the secretion of serotonin and other vasoactive substances from neuroendocrine tumors, most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract. The excess serotonin is metabolized in the liver to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, which is excreted in the urine. The most common site of the primary tumor in carcinoid syndrome is the small intestine. These tumors can also cause peptic ulcers due to the increased gastrin levels, leading to increased gastric acid secretion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Multiple peptic ulcers\"}"
