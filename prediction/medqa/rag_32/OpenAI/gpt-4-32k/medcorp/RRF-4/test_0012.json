    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's clinical presentation and genetic evaluation are consistent with neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas, which often present with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and imbalance. Other manifestations of NF2 include schwannomas of other cranial and peripheral nerves, meningiomas, and ependymomas. The genetic defect in NF2 is a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin (also known as schwannomin), a cytoskeletal protein. Therefore, this patient is at increased risk for meningioma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Meningioma\"}"
