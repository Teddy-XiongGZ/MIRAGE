    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a pulled elbow (nursemaid's elbow), which is a common injury in young children resulting from longitudinal traction on the arm, such as when swinging a child by the arms. The radial head subluxates from the annular ligament, causing immediate pain and refusal to use the arm. The child usually holds the arm in slight flexion and pronation. Pain is localized to the radial head. The diagnosis is clinical, and imaging is usually not necessary. The treatment is reduction by supination of the forearm followed by flexion of the elbow or by hyperpronation. Both methods have high success rates, but hyperpronation is associated with less pain during the procedure and a higher first-attempt success rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Moderate flexion then hyperpronation\"}"
