    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency, along with the findings of high blood pressure, high blood glucose, and low potassium level, suggest a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome is caused by an excess of cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone. The abdominal CT scan showing a mass in the left adrenal gland suggests that this could be an adrenal adenoma, which is a common cause of Cushing's syndrome. Cortisol, like other steroid hormones, exerts its action by binding to intracellular receptors. These receptors then translocate to the nucleus and modulate gene transcription. Therefore, the hormone excess in this patient is likely exerting its action via intracellular receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
