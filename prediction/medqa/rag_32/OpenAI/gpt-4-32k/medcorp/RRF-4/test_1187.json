    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with malignant hyperthermia, a life-threatening condition triggered by exposure to certain anesthetic agents (eg, succinylcholine, inhaled anesthetics). It is characterized by a hypermetabolic state due to uncontrolled release of calcium in the skeletal muscle. Clinical features include hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, acidosis, muscle rigidity (especially jaw and proximal muscles), and hyperkalemia. The most sensitive sign of malignant hyperthermia is an unexpected rise in the end-tidal CO2 level (despite increased minute ventilation), along with tachycardia. The treatment of malignant hyperthermia includes discontinuation of the triggering agent, hyperventilation with 100% oxygen, and administration of dantrolene, a ryanodine receptor antagonist that inhibits the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
