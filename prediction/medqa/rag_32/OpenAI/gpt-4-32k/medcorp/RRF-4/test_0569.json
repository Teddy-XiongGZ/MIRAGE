This condition is often caused by the use of serotonergic drugs. The patient's recent belligerent behavior and subsequent symptoms suggest he may have ingested a serotonergic drug at the party. The most effective treatment for serotonin syndrome is discontinuation of the offending agent and supportive care. However, when symptoms are severe and life-threatening, as in this case, cyproheptadine should be administered.
