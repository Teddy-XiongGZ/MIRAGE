    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of cough, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and facial tenderness over the maxillary sinuses suggest a sinus infection, likely bacterial given the duration and presence of purulent nasal discharge. The first-line treatment for bacterial sinusitis is amoxicillin. However, the patient also has worsening asthma symptoms, which could be due to the sinus infection or a lower respiratory tract infection. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid would cover both typical sinus pathogens and also bacteria that commonly cause lower respiratory tract infections, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are often resistant to amoxicillin alone due to beta-lactamase production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid\"}"
