    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of right upper abdominal pain, nausea, and fever, along with physical examination findings of a distended abdomen and right upper quadrant tenderness, are suggestive of acute cholecystitis. This is further supported by the leukocytosis seen in the laboratory studies. The normal liver function tests rule out hepatotropic virus infection, which would typically cause elevations in AST and ALT. Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma would suggest acute pancreatitis, but this is unlikely given the lack of elevated amylase or lipase levels. A fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine is a complication of chronic cholecystitis and would typically present with air in the biliary tree or gallstone ileus, neither of which is mentioned in the vignette. The cholescintigraphy findings of visualization of the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel but not the gallbladder are consistent with cystic duct obstruction, which is the cause of acute cholecystitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
