    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old female who has not yet had her first period, a condition known as primary amenorrhea. She has normal secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner IV breast and pubic hair development), indicating that she has been exposed to estrogen. Her FSH level is within the normal range, suggesting that her ovaries are functioning properly. An abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries, ruling out anatomical abnormalities as the cause of her amenorrhea. Hyperprolactinemia can cause amenorrhea, but it is usually associated with galactorrhea, which this patient does not have. An imperforate hymen or vaginal septum could also cause primary amenorrhea, but these conditions would likely be detected on a pelvic exam, which was unremarkable in this patient. Given her age, the presence of secondary sexual characteristics, and the absence of other symptoms or abnormalities, it is most likely that this patient is experiencing normal development and will begin menstruating soon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
