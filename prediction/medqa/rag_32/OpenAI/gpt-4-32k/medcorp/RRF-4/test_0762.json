    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and has been on metformin and lifestyle modifications for 3 months. However, his HbA1C is still high at 8.5% and his serum glucose is 240 mg/dL, indicating that his diabetes is not well controlled. According to the American Diabetes Association, if monotherapy at the maximum tolerated dose does not achieve or maintain the HbA1C target over 3 months, a second oral agent should be added. Basal-bolus insulin is usually reserved for patients with severe hyperglycemia (HbA1C >10%) or symptoms of hyperglycemia. Therefore, the best next step would be to add a second oral agent to his treatment regimen. Both sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones can be used as second-line agents. However, sulfonylureas are generally preferred due to their lower cost and longer clinical experience.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
