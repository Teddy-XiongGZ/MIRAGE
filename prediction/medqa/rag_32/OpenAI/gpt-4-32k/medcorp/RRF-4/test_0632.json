    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, especially when lying on her left side, and a diastolic murmur that is prominent when she lies on her left side, suggest a cardiac issue. The presence of a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum as shown by the echocardiogram further supports this. Rheumatic fever and innocent murmur are less likely given the patient's age and the presence of the atrial mass. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis typically presents with systemic emboli, which is not mentioned in the case. Atrial myxoma, a benign tumor of the heart, often presents with symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, and can be visualized as a mass in the atrium on echocardiogram, making it the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
