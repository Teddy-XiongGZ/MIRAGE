    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of fatigue, lightheadedness, bradycardia, hypotension, and dry mucous membranes suggests hypovolemia, likely due to dehydration. The ECG findings of a constant PR interval with every third P wave that is nonconducted is consistent with Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second-degree atrioventricular block. This type of block is often seen in patients with inferior wall myocardial infarction, but it can also be caused by medications or increased vagal tone. In this patient, the most likely cause of the heart block is the use of lisinopril, which can decrease heart rate and contractility. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to discontinue the lisinopril and provide intravenous fluids to correct the hypovolemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Cardiac pacing\"}"
