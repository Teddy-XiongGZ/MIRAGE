    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where a new screening test allows for earlier detection of a type of adrenal cancer. The study then compares the 5-year survival rates of screened and unscreened patients who decline treatment. The screened population shows statistically better outcomes. This could potentially introduce a type of bias known as lead-time bias, where the increased survival time observed in the screened group may be due to earlier detection rather than a true improvement in survival. This is because survival time is calculated from the time of diagnosis, and screening can make the diagnosis earlier. Therefore, to prevent this bias, the study should use mortality rates instead of survival rates in the analysis. Mortality rates provide a measure of the risk of dying from the disease and are not influenced by the time of diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
