    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, specifically in the second trimester. This is suggestive of a structural abnormality in the uterus that is preventing the normal progression of pregnancy. A hysterosalpingogram is a type of X-ray used to examine the uterus and fallopian tubes and can help identify structural abnormalities such as fibroids or polyps that could contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss. Karotyping would be useful if there was a suspicion of a genetic cause for the recurrent losses, but this is less likely given the specific timing of the losses in the second trimester. Prolactin and TSH levels could indicate endocrine causes of pregnancy loss, but these would typically cause early miscarriage rather than second trimester losses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
