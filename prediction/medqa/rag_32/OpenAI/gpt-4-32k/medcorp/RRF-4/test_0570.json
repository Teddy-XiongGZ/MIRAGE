    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's age, history of pain exacerbated by activity, and physical examination findings of tenderness and swelling at the tibial tuberosity are suggestive of Osgood-Schlatter disease. This is a common cause of knee pain in adolescents and is due to repetitive traction on the tibial tubercle by the patellar tendon, which leads to inflammation and avulsion of the tubercle. X-ray findings of anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity further support this diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is conservative, with rest, activity modification, and symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs such as ketorolac.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
