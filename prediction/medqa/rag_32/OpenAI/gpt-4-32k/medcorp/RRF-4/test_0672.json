    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The development of oocytes in a female fetus begins in utero. By the 20th week of gestation, the female fetus has developed 6 to 7 million oogonia. These oogonia begin meiosis but are arrested in prophase of meiosis I. This process continues until birth, and by the time of birth, the number of oogonia has decreased to approximately 1 to 2 million. These oogonia, now termed primary oocytes, remain arrested in prophase of meiosis I until puberty. Therefore, the baby's oocytes are arrested in prophase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
