    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a type of aphasia, a language disorder that results from damage to portions of the brain that are responsible for language. The patient's inability to repeat phrases, despite having fluent speech and good comprehension, is characteristic of conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia is most commonly caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a bundle of nerve fibers that connects Wernicke's area (involved in language comprehension, located in the superior temporal gyrus) and Broca's area (involved in speech production, located in the inferior frontal gyrus). Therefore, the arcuate fasciculus is the structure most likely responsible for this patient's syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Arcuate fasciculus\"}"
