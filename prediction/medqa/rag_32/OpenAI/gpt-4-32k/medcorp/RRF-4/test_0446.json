    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a class I anti-arrhythmic drug that is a sodium channel blocker, slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers, blocks potassium channels, prolongs action potential duration, and does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. It also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. The side effects of such a drug are not directly mentioned in the documents, but we can infer from the drug's properties. Anticholinergic effects can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention. Alpha-blocking activity can cause hypotension, dizziness, and headache. However, none of the options provided match these side effects. Therefore, we need to think about the side effects of sodium and potassium channel blockers. Sodium channel blockers can cause CNS effects like dizziness and ataxia, but these are not among the options. Potassium channel blockers can cause pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits, which matches with option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
