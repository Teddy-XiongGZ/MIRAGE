    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest that she has anorexia nervosa, which is characterized by self-imposed starvation leading to significant weight loss. This condition can lead to amenorrhea due to the body's response to starvation, which includes a decrease in the production of hormones such as estrogen. This is not typically associated with insulin resistance, which is more common in conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The patient's decreased adiposity would contribute to hypoestrogenemia, as adipose tissue plays a role in the production of estrogen. The patient's extensive weight loss is not necessarily indicative of hyperthyroidism, as it can be explained by her self-imposed starvation and excessive exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
