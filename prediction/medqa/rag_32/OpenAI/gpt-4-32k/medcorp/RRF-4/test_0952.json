    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been diagnosed with celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten. The mainstay of treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet, which the patient has been instructed to follow. However, the question asks for a temporary measure to control the severe diarrhea and bloating. Among the options, avoiding all dairy products and restriction of soy products are dietary modifications that may not have an immediate effect on the symptoms.
