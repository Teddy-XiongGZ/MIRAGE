    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with hypernatremia, which is defined as a serum sodium level >145 mEq/L. The most common cause of hypernatremia in hospitalized patients is water loss. In this patient, the high-volume pancreatic drainage is likely contributing to significant free water losses. The best next step in management is to replace the free water deficit. As the patient is obtunded and unable to drink water, the free water should be replaced intravenously. D5W is a reasonable choice as it is essentially free water after the dextrose is metabolized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 5% dextrose IV\"}"
