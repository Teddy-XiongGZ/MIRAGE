    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is diagnosed with HIV and is started on antiretroviral therapy. However, he develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so it is replaced with ritonavir. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV. One of the most common side effects of protease inhibitors, including ritonavir, is lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy is a condition characterized by abnormal distribution of fat in the body, and can manifest as lipoatrophy (loss of fat) or lipohypertrophy (gain of fat). Hepatotoxicity is a potential side effect of many medications, including some antiretrovirals, but it is not the most common side effect associated with ritonavir. Myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy are not commonly associated with ritonavir.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lipodystrophy\"}"
