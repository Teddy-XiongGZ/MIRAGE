    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of lowering the cut-off point from 5mm to 4mm in the tuberculin skin test. The cut-off point is the threshold at which the test result is considered positive. Lowering the cut-off point would mean that more people would test positive. This would increase the number of true positive and false positive results, while decreasing the number of false negatives. Therefore, the property that would increase is the negative predictive value, which is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly don't have the disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Negative predictive value\"}"
