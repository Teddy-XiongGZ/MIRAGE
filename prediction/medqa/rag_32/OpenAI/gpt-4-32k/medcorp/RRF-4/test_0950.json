    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of epithelium that lines both the thyroid gland and a part of the female reproductive tract. The thyroid gland is described as being lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. This description matches that of simple cuboidal epithelium. According to Document [21], simple cuboidal epithelium lines most organs of the digestive tract including the stomach, and intestines, and also lines the uterus. However, the uterus is not one of the answer choices. Looking at the answer choices, we need to find which part of the female reproductive tract is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. According to Document [30], this type of tissue can be observed in sweat glands, mammary glands, circumanal glands, and salivary glands. However, none of these are part of the female reproductive tract. Document [21] also mentions that simple cuboidal epithelium lines the ovaries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
