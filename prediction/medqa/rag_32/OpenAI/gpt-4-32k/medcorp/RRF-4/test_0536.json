    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute liver injury, as evidenced by the markedly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. ALT is more specific to the liver and is found primarily in the cytosol of hepatocytes, while AST is found in both the cytosol and mitochondria of hepatocytes, as well as in other tissues. The pattern of liver injury can provide clues to the underlying etiology. In this case, the patient's liver injury is likely due to ischemia resulting from his initial hypotensive episode. Ischemic hepatitis, or 'shock liver,' results from a decrease in hepatic blood flow, which in this patient was likely due to his diverticular bleeding and resultant hypotension. The centrilobular hepatocytes (those surrounding the central vein in the hepatic lobule) are the most susceptible to ischemic injury because they are the furthest from the hepatic arterial supply and therefore the last to receive oxygenated blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Centrilobular hepatocytes\"}"
