    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p-value is a statistical measure that helps scientists determine whether their hypotheses are correct. It is used in hypothesis testing to help you support or reject the null hypothesis. It represents the probability that the results of your test occurred at random. If p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (0.05), you reject the null hypothesis. In this case, the p-value is 0.052, which is slightly greater than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the difference in LDL reduction between the two statin groups is due to chance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
