    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of facial drooping, difficulty with dressing, and decreased muscle strength in the left upper and lower extremities suggest a stroke. Given the acute onset of these symptoms, it is crucial to quickly determine the type of stroke to guide treatment. A CT scan of the head is the most appropriate next step because it can quickly rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, which would contraindicate the use of thrombolytic therapy. An MRI of the brain, while also useful in diagnosing a stroke, takes longer to perform and may delay treatment. A lumbar puncture is not indicated in this case as there are no signs of meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Duplex ultrasonography of the neck could be useful in identifying carotid artery disease, but it would not change the immediate management of this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
