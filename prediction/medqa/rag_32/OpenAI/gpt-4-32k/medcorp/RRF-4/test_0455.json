    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden vision loss in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing suggest a lesion in the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The PCA supplies the occipital lobe, which contains the primary visual cortex. A lesion in the distribution of the PCA can cause contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing. The macula, responsible for central vision, is spared because of the dual blood supply from both the PCA and the middle cerebral artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Posterior cerebral artery\"}"
