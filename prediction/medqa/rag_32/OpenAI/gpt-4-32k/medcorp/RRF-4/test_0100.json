    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn has jaundice, which is characterized by yellowing of the skin and sclerae. This is caused by an accumulation of bilirubin, a byproduct of red blood cell (RBC) breakdown. The newborn's lab results show an elevated total bilirubin level with a predominance of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, which is consistent with increased RBC breakdown (hemolysis). The newborn also has an elevated reticulocyte count, which indicates that the bone marrow is producing more RBCs to compensate for the hemolysis. The mother is blood group O and Rh-negative, and she has a positive anti-Rh antibody titer. However, the newborn is also Rh-negative, so the mother's anti-Rh antibodies would not target the newborn's RBCs. The newborn is blood group B, while the mother is blood group O. People with blood group O have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Therefore, the mother's anti-B antibodies could target the newborn's group B RBCs, causing hemolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Anti-B antibodies\"}"
