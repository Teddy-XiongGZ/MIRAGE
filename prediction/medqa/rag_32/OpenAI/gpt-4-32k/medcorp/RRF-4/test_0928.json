    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening, systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Common manifestations include urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, wheezing, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The most common triggers are medications, foods, and insect stings. Initial management includes removal of the inciting agent, if possible, and immediate administration of intramuscular epinephrine. Intravenous fluids should be given for patients with hypotension, and airway management should be initiated for those with respiratory distress or impending airway obstruction from angioedema. If hypotension persists despite these measures, vasopressors should be administered. The patient in the vignette is taking labetalol, a nonselective beta-blocker that can inhibit the vasopressor effect of epinephrine. In such cases, glucagon can be used to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate and improve both inotropic and chronotropic cardiac function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Administer glucagon\"}"
