    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of increasing shortness of breath during exertion suggest a cardiac issue. The physical examination findings provide more specific clues. An early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. A midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border could suggest aortic stenosis, but this is less likely given the other findings. A late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex is suggestive of mitral stenosis, but this is also less likely given the other findings. The presence of an S3 heart sound and bounding pulses at the radial arteries further support the diagnosis of aortic regurgitation, which is characterized by a wide pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and increased stroke volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Aortic regurgitation\"}"
