    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include yellowing of the eyes, which is a sign of jaundice. This can be caused by a variety of conditions, but the fact that the patient has had a similar episode in the past suggests a chronic or recurring condition. The patient's recent episode of binge drinking could have exacerbated an underlying liver condition, leading to the current symptoms. However, the patient's history of 'intermittent fasting' and the fact that he is sexually active with both men and women do not seem to be directly related to his symptoms. Among the given options, 'Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase' and 'Defective bilirubin excretion' could both potentially lead to jaundice. However, 'Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase' is associated with Gilbert's syndrome, a common, harmless liver condition in which the liver doesn't properly process bilirubin. People with Gilbert's syndrome often experience occasional and mild jaundice, particularly during periods of exertion, stress or fasting. This seems to fit the patient's symptoms and history best.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
