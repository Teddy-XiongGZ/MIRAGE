    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sharp, pleuritic chest pain, which is a common symptom of pulmonary embolism. However, he has no other symptoms such as shortness of breath, tachypnea, or hemoptysis. His risk factors include a sedentary lifestyle due to his job as a long-haul truck driver, smoking, and a history of malignancy, although the latter is not active. Given these factors, his risk for pulmonary embolism is low. In such cases, the first step to rule out pulmonary embolism is usually a D-dimer test, which is a sensitive but not specific test. If the D-dimer level is normal, it can effectively rule out a pulmonary embolism. Other tests such as ECG, V/Q scan, or CT pulmonary angiogram are more specific but less sensitive and are usually reserved for patients with a higher pretest probability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
