    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in the question has a history of severe burns and presents with tarry black stools, hypotension, and tachycardia. Tarry black stools, also known as melena, are a sign of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to the loss of blood. Given the patient's history of severe burns, it is likely that the stress of the injury led to the development of stress ulcers, also known as Curling's ulcers, in the stomach or duodenum. These ulcers can bleed, leading to the presentation of melena. The development of these ulcers is thought to be due to decreased blood flow to the gastric mucosa, leading to ischemic injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Decreased gastric blood flow\"}"
