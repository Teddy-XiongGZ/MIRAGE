    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe chest pain, S3 heart sound, rales in the lower right and left lung lobes, and echocardiography findings of an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium suggest heart failure. The recent severe emotional stress (loss of her husband in a car accident) is a classic trigger for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy or 'broken heart syndrome'. This condition is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction, often in response to severe emotional stress. The other options are less likely: Atrial fibrillation would typically present with an irregularly irregular pulse, which is not mentioned in the case. Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy would not typically present acutely in response to emotional stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\"}"
