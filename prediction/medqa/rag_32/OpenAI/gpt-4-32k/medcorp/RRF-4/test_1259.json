    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient fell from his bicycle and has severe pain and swelling over the right clavicle, suggesting a clavicle fracture. The intact radial pulse and normal sensory examination in the right upper limb make vascular or nerve injury unlikely. The chest x-ray would likely confirm the clavicle fracture. The most appropriate next step in management would be to immobilize the shoulder to allow for healing. Tension banding is a surgical procedure and would not be the first step in management. An MRI would be more useful if a soft tissue injury was suspected. Arteriography would be used if a vascular injury was suspected, but the intact radial pulse makes this unlikely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
