    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of headaches, blurry vision, and erectile dysfunction, along with the finding of a temporal visual field deficit (bitemporal hemianopsia) and an intrasellar mass on MRI, are suggestive of a pituitary adenoma. These tumors often present with symptoms related to mass effect (such as headache and visual changes due to compression of the optic chiasm) and/or endocrine abnormalities. In this case, the patient's erectile dysfunction suggests a hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Among the answer choices, the most common type of hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma is a prolactinoma, which arises from lactotroph cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lactotrophs\"}"
