    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, difficulty feeding, and inability to sit upright, along with the physical findings of tongue protrusion, distended neck veins, crackles at lung bases, S3 gallop, and hepatomegaly, suggest a condition involving both cardiac and muscular systems. The patient's age and the chronicity of symptoms suggest a congenital or metabolic disorder. The enzyme defects listed in the choices are all associated with metabolic disorders. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency leads to McArdle disease, which typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood with exercise intolerance and muscle cramps, not matching this patient's presentation. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency leads to a condition characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and lethargy, but this patient's serum glucose is normal. Glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency leads to Cori disease, which presents with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and growth retardation, but again, this patient's serum glucose is normal. Lysosomal acid maltase deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, presents in infancy with hypotonia, macroglossia, and cardiomegaly, which matches this patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
