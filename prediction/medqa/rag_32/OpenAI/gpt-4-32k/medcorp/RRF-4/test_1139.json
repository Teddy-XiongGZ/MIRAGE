    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include rapid cognitive decline, myoclonus, ataxia, and visual hallucinations. These symptoms are characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a prion disease. Prions are infectious proteins that can cause disease by inducing abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins, usually found most abundantly in the brain. The most common form of prion disease that affects humans is CJD. Prions are resistant to inactivation by usual sterilization procedures including autoclaving, which is a process of sterilizing equipment using high pressure steam. Therefore, prions can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments. Prions do not contain genetic material and cannot survive independent from a host. They also do not have a cell wall containing peptidoglycan. Prion diseases do not lead to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
