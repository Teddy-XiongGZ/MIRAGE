    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's condition is described as having 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is calculated by adding the number of apnea events to the number of hypopnea events, then dividing by the number of hours of sleep. In this case, the AHI would be (12+30)/7 = 6, which is more than 5. Therefore, statement A is correct. The other statements are not directly related to the information given in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
