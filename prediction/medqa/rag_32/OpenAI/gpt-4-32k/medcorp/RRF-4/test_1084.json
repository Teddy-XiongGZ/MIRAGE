    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of noisy breathing, cyanosis of the lips, and intermittent respiratory distress that worsens with feeding and improves with crying are suggestive of a congenital anomaly of the upper airway. The most common of these is choanal atresia, which is characterized by a failure in the development of communication between the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx. This condition can be unilateral or bilateral. Bilateral choanal atresia presents in the neonatal period with intermittent respiratory distress that worsens with feeding and improves with crying. This is because neonates are obligate nasal breathers, and crying forces them to open their mouth and breathe. Unilateral choanal atresia often goes unnoticed and may present later in life with unilateral nasal obstruction and discharge. The diagnosis of choanal atresia can be confirmed by the inability to pass a catheter through the nasal cavity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
