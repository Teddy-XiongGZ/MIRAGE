    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant's presentation of pulmonary hypoplasia, low-set ears, retrognathia, and abnormal extremity development suggests a congenital syndrome. The most likely diagnosis in this case is Potter sequence, which is characterized by oligohydramnios leading to pulmonary hypoplasia, flat facies with low-set ears, and limb deformities. The most common cause of oligohydramnios and subsequently Potter sequence is renal agenesis. However, posterior urethral valves can also cause oligohydramnios by obstructing urinary outflow, leading to decreased amniotic fluid and the characteristic features of Potter sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Posterior urethral valves\"}"
