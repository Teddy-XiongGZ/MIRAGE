    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient with monoclonal gammopathy and peripheral neuropathy, with a bone marrow biopsy showing 6% monoclonal plasma cells. The question also mentions that these plasma cells have downregulated class I major histocompatibility molecules. This is a key point, as class I MHC molecules are recognized by T cells. However, the question specifies that the immune cells in question can lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. This rules out T cells and macrophages, which require activation. Neutrophils, while they can phagocytose and destroy cells, also typically require activation and are not specifically known for targeting cells with downregulated MHC molecules. Natural killer cells, on the other hand, are known for their ability to recognize and kill cells that have downregulated MHC class I molecules, and they do not require prior activation or opsonization. Therefore, the best answer is natural killer cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
