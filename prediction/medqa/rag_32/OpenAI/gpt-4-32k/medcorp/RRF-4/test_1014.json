    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's rectovaginal swab culture grew bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis. This is indicative of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization. GBS is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Vertical transmission can occur during labor and delivery. The most effective way to prevent neonatal GBS disease is through intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Ampicillin is one of the antibiotics commonly used for this purpose. Breastfeeding does not contribute to GBS transmission, so abstaining from it is not necessary. Administering intravenous immune globulin postpartum is not a standard practice for preventing GBS transmission. Amniocentesis at 37 weeks is not indicated as it does not prevent vertical transmission and carries its own risks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
