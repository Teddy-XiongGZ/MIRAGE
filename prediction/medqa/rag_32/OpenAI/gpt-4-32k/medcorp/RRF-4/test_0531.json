    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. The initial management of DKA involves fluid resuscitation, which has already been initiated with 0.9% NaCl. The next step in management is to start an insulin infusion to lower blood glucose levels. Insulin helps to suppress hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, thereby reducing ketone production. It's also important to monitor and replace electrolytes as needed during treatment, but the immediate next step after fluid resuscitation in DKA is typically to start insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Start IV insulin infusion\"}"
