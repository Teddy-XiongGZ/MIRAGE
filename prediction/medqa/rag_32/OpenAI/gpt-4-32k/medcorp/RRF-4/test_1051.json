    "The maintenance dose of a drug can be calculated using the formula: Maintenance dose = (Desired drug concentration * Clearance) / Bioavailability. First, we need to calculate the clearance of the drug. Clearance can be calculated using the formula: Clearance = (0.693 * Volume of Distribution) / Half-life. Given that the Volume of Distribution is 14.3 liters and the Half-life is 2 hours, the Clearance would be: Clearance = (0.693 * 14.3) / 2 = 4.97 liters/hour. Next, we can substitute the values into the maintenance dose formula: Maintenance dose = (15 mg/L * 4.97 L/hour) / 0.5 = 149.1 mg/hour. Since the question asks for the dose to be given every 8 hours, the maintenance dose would be: 149.1 mg/hour * 8 hours = 1192.8 mg. Therefore, the closest answer choice is C. 1200 milligrams. So, the final output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I calculated the clearance of the drug using the given volume of distribution and half-life. Then, I used this clearance value to calculate the maintenance dose using the desired drug concentration and bioavailability. Finally, I adjusted this dose for an 8-hour period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
