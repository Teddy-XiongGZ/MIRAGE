    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 42-year-old woman who is 10 weeks pregnant and has been experiencing some nausea and vomiting, which are common symptoms in early pregnancy. Her vital signs are within normal limits and her physical examination is unremarkable. At this stage in pregnancy, routine prenatal care typically involves regular follow-up appointments to monitor the progress of the pregnancy. Invasive procedures like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are usually reserved for specific indications such as suspected genetic or chromosomal abnormalities. Cell-free DNA testing is a non-invasive prenatal screening test that can be used to detect certain chromosomal abnormalities, but it is not a routine part of prenatal care and is typically offered to women who have an increased risk of having a baby with a chromosomal disorder. Given the patient's age, she may be at a higher risk for chromosomal abnormalities, but there is no mention of any specific concerns or risk factors in the case. Therefore, the next best step in management would be regular follow-up appointments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
