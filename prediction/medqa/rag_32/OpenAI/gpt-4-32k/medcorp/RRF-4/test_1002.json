    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a young man who has been experiencing dizziness and palpitations for 2 days. These symptoms started after he attended a bachelor party where he lost several drinking games. This suggests that he consumed a significant amount of alcohol, which can lead to various cardiac issues. However, without the ECG image, it's impossible to make a definitive diagnosis. Among the options, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are both arrhythmias that can be triggered by excessive alcohol consumption, known as 'holiday heart syndrome'. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes a distinct pattern on an ECG and can lead to sudden cardiac death, but there's no mention of a family history of sudden cardiac death. Sick sinus syndrome is typically seen in older adults and involves the malfunction of the heart's natural pacemaker, the sinus node. Given the patient's history and age, it's less likely. Therefore, without the ECG image, it's difficult to make a definitive diagnosis, but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia due to excessive alcohol consumption seems most likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or C. Ventricular tachycardia\"}"
