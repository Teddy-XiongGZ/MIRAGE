    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of eye pain and blurry vision, along with the image showing a corneal ulcer, suggest a diagnosis of keratitis. The patient's use of contact lenses is a risk factor for this condition. The two types of keratitis in the answer choices are Herpes simplex and Pseudomonas. Herpes simplex keratitis typically presents with a dendritic ulcer, which is not seen in the image. Pseudomonas keratitis is often associated with contact lens use and can progress rapidly, which aligns with the patient's 1-day history of progressive symptoms. Therefore, Pseudomonas keratitis is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
