    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heart failure cells, also known as hemosiderin-laden macrophages, are formed when red blood cells leak out of congested capillaries in conditions such as heart failure. These red blood cells are then engulfed by alveolar macrophages. The breakdown of these red blood cells within the macrophages leads to the release of hemosiderin, a form of stored iron. This process of engulfing and breaking down materials, including red blood cells, is carried out by lysosomes within the cell. Therefore, lysosomes play a significant role in the formation of heart failure cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
