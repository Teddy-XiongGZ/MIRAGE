    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include multiple falls, dizziness, wide-based gait, inability to stand without support, and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands. These symptoms suggest a problem with balance and coordination, which are functions of the cerebellum. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and exposure to industrial solvents at work could both contribute to damage to the cerebellum, leading to cerebellar degeneration. Korsakoff syndrome and Wernicke's encephalopathy are both associated with chronic alcohol abuse, but they primarily affect memory and mental status, which are not reported as problems in this case. Methanol poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms, but it typically affects vision, which is not mentioned in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
