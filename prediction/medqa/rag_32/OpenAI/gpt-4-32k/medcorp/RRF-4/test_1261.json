The bone marrow biopsy showing 34% myeloblasts with Auer rods that are myeloperoxidase positive confirms a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The treatment of AML depends on the subtype of the disease. The presence of Auer rods suggests a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML. APL is specifically treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), also known as retinoic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
