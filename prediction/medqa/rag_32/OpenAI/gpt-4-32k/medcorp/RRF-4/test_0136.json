    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's chest pain worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate. This suggests that the pain is related to digestion and not to the heart. Calcium carbonate is an antacid, which neutralizes stomach acid. If this improves the patient's pain, it suggests that the pain is due to acid reflux or heartburn, not a heart condition. This is supported by the fact that the patient's ECG is normal and he denies dyspnea on exertion, which are common symptoms of heart disease. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's pain is gastroesophageal junction incompetence, which can cause acid reflux.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
