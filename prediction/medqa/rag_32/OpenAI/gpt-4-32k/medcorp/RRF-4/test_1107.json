    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the changes in respiratory function that occur with aging. As people age, the chest wall becomes stiffer and less compliant, which is the opposite of choice C. The residual volume, which is the amount of air left in the lungs after a forced expiration, actually increases with age, not decreases, ruling out choice B. The A-a gradient, which is the difference between the alveolar concentration of oxygen and the arterial concentration of oxygen, can increase with age due to issues like ventilation-perfusion mismatch, so choice D is incorrect. This leaves us with choice A, increased lung compliance. As people age, the lung tissue loses its elasticity and becomes more compliant, or easier to inflate. However, because the chest wall is becoming stiffer at the same time, the overall compliance of the respiratory system doesn't change much.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
