    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is caused by the exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. These toxins are released into the bloodstream and cause widespread epidermal damage. The primary defense against these toxins is the production of neutralizing antibodies.
