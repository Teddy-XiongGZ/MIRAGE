    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history of exposure to rubella suggest a rubella infection. However, her serology shows that she has high-avidity rubella IgG antibodies, which indicates a past infection or immunization, not a recent or primary infection. The decrease in her rubella IgG titers from 1:128 to 1:64 could be due to normal waning of immunity over time. The absence of rubella IgM, which would indicate a recent infection, further supports that this is not a new infection. Therefore, the patient is likely immune to rubella and her fetus is not at risk. The next step would be to reassure her and recommend vaccination postpartum if her immunity wanes further.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
