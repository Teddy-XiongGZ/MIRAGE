This condition is characterized by a marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety, and is avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective treatment for specific phobias. CBT for specific phobias typically includes exposure therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to the feared object or situation in a controlled manner until the fear response is extinguished.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
