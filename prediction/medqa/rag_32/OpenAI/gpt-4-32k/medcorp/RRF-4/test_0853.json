    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of hyperthermia, altered mental status, and generalized muscle rigidity following administration of an antipsychotic medication is suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition most commonly caused by the use of antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol. The condition is characterized by the development of severe muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, and it can also cause autonomic dysregulation and altered mental status. The other options are less likely: Catatonic schizophrenia does not typically present with hyperthermia or follow the administration of an antipsychotic. Heat stroke could potentially cause similar symptoms, but it would not explain the patient's muscle rigidity. Oversedation could cause altered mental status, but it would not typically cause hyperthermia or muscle rigidity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
