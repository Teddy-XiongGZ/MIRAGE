    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of somnolence, ataxia, and nystagmus, along with the missing seizure medication, suggest that he may have accidentally ingested his grandson's seizure medication. Many seizure medications, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid, can cause these symptoms. The concern about the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) trending down suggests that the ingested substance may interact with warfarin, a medication that the patient is taking. Valproic acid is known to displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to an increased INR. However, in overdose situations, valproic acid can inhibit its own metabolism and lead to a decreased INR. Valproic acid is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Sodium bicarbonate is known to alkalinize the urine, which can increase the renal clearance of weak acids such as valproic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Sodium bicarbonate\"}"
