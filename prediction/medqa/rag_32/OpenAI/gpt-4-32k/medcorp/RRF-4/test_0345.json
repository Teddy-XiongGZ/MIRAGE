    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of generalized pruritus, raised erythematous plaques on the skin, clear liquid discharge from his nose, and sneezing that started after eating at a seafood restaurant suggest an allergic reaction, likely due to food allergy. Antihistamines are the first-line treatment for such reactions. Both diphenhydramine and fexofenadine are antihistamines, but diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that can cause sedation and anticholinergic side effects, including acute angle-closure glaucoma, which the patient had an episode of four months ago. Fexofenadine, on the other hand, is a second-generation antihistamine that is less sedating and has fewer anticholinergic side effects, making it a safer choice for this patient. Vitamin K is used to treat coagulation disorders and is not relevant here. Calamine lotion can help with itching, but it does not address the underlying allergic reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
