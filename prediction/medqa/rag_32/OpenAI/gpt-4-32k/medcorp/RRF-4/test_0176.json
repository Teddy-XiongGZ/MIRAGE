    "The specificity of a test is calculated as the proportion of true negative results (those without the disease who test negative) out of all the actual negative cases (those without the disease). In this case, the number of true negatives is the number of patients without Parkinson's disease who tested negative, which is 600 (total without PD) - 20 (those without PD who tested positive) = 580. The total number of actual negatives is the total number of patients without Parkinson's disease, which is 600. Therefore, the specificity is calculated as 580 / 600. So, the correct answer is D. 580 / (580 + 20). The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The specificity of a test is calculated as the proportion of true negative results out of all the actual negative cases.
