    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of petechiae, ecchymosis, and nose bleeding suggest a bleeding disorder. The normal platelet count and coagulation tests rule out thrombocytopenia and coagulation factor deficiencies. The large platelets seen on the blood smear and the normal platelet aggregation test with ristocetin suggest a platelet function disorder. Bernard-Soulier disease is characterized by large platelets and a defect in platelet adhesion, which can lead to an increased bleeding time. Von Willebrand disease and Glanzmann\u2019s thrombasthenia typically present with normal or small platelets, and scurvy is associated with vitamin C deficiency and would not cause large platelets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bernard-Soulier disease\"}"
