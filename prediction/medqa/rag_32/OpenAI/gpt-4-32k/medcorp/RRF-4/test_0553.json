    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an aldosterone receptor antagonist that has minimal side effects, particularly impotence and gynecomastia. From the documents, it is clear that both spironolactone and eplerenone are aldosterone receptor antagonists. However, spironolactone is a nonselective aldosterone antagonist and has side effects such as gynecomastia and impotence due to its binding to progesterone and androgen receptors. On the other hand, eplerenone is a selective aldosterone antagonist with minimal affinity for progesterone and androgenic receptors, thus it has fewer reports of adverse sexual effects. Therefore, eplerenone would be the best choice for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
