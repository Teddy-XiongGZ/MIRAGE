    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of frontal bossing, shortened upper and lower extremities, normal axial skeleton, and normal intelligence is suggestive of achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is a form of short-limb dwarfism that is caused by an activating mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This mutation leads to an overactive receptor, which inhibits chondrocyte proliferation and function in the growth plate, disrupting endochondral ossification. Endochondral ossification is the process by which long bones grow in length. Therefore, the most likely disrupted process in this patient's condition is endochondral ossification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
