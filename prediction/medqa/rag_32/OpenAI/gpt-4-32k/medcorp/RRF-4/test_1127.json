    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and the finding of gram-negative cocci in pairs in the cerebrospinal fluid are indicative of Neisseria meningitidis, which causes meningococcal meningitis. The initial step in the pathogenesis of N. meningitidis infection involves the attachment of the bacteria to the nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, which is mediated by type IV pili. These adhesive pili are hair-like appendages on the bacterial surface that mediate attachment to host cells, which is the first step in the pathogenesis of many bacterial infections. Therefore, adhesive pili is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
