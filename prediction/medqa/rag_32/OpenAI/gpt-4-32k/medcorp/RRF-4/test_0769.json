Essential tremor is often familial and typically presents as a bilateral, high-frequency tremor during voluntary movement that decreases with rest. It can be exacerbated by emotional stress or stimulants such as caffeine. First-line treatment options for essential tremor include the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol and the anticonvulsant primidone. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, can be used for short-term relief of acute symptoms of essential tremor, but is not typically used as first-line treatment due to the risk of dependence. Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic medication used in the treatment of Parkinson disease, not essential tremor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Propranolol\"}"
