    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms of lethargy, decreased feeding, and easy bruising are concerning for a bleeding disorder. Given the history of minimal prenatal or postnatal care and home birth, it is likely that the child did not receive the standard prophylactic vitamin K injection after birth. Vitamin K is necessary for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver. Newborns are at risk for vitamin K deficiency due to low vitamin K content in breast milk, minimal body stores, and lack of colonic bacteria to synthesize vitamin K. This can lead to vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), previously known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. VKDB can present early (within 24 hours of birth), classically (1-7 days), or late (2-12 weeks). Late VKDB is more common in exclusively breastfed infants who did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis. It often presents with intracranial hemorrhage, which can manifest as irritability or lethargy, as in this patient. Other common sites of bleeding include the skin and gastrointestinal tract.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
