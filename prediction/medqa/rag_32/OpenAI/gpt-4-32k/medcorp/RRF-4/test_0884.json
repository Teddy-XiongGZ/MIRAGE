    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ribosome is responsible for protein synthesis. According to Document [0], the destination of synthesized ribosomes for protein translation is the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER). Document [6] also mentions that when a ribosome begins to synthesize proteins that are needed in some organelles, the ribosome making this protein can become 'membrane-bound' in a region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called the 'rough ER'. The newly produced polypeptide chains are inserted directly into the ER by the ribosome undertaking vectorial synthesis and are then transported to their destinations, through the secretory pathway. This suggests that the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the location essential for protein-secreting cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
