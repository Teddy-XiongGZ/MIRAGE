    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of breathlessness and cough, along with the physical examination finding of inspiratory crackles over the lung bases, suggest a lung condition. The patient's history of amiodarone use is also significant, as this medication is known to cause pulmonary toxicity, which can manifest as interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is a restrictive lung disease, which is characterized on spirometry by a decrease in both forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), but with a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio. This is because both FEV1 and FVC are reduced, but FEV1 is not disproportionately reduced as it is in obstructive lung diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
