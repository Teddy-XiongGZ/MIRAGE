    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with gout, which is often precipitated by alcohol use and is characterized by severe pain, swelling, and erythema of the first MTP joint. After resolution of the acute gout attack, patients are often started on a medication to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. Allopurinol is a common drug used for this purpose. Allopurinol works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of uric acid, thereby reducing uric acid levels and preventing gout attacks. However, a known side effect of allopurinol is bone marrow suppression, which can lead to pancytopenia, as seen in this patient on follow-up.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
