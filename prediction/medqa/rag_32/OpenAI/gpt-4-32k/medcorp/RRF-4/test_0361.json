    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's mother has Graves' disease and was treated with propylthiouracil during pregnancy. The baby is showing signs of hyperthyroidism, such as irritability, increased bowel movements, tachycardia, and a neck mass, which is likely a goiter. This suggests that the baby has neonatal Graves' disease, which can occur when maternal thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins cross the placenta. The mother's history of intravenous drug use raises the possibility of neonatal abstinence syndrome, but the absence of other typical signs such as sneezing, yawning, and poor feeding makes this less likely. The most appropriate treatment for neonatal Graves' disease is antithyroid drugs, such as methimazole, and beta-blockers, such as propranolol, to control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
