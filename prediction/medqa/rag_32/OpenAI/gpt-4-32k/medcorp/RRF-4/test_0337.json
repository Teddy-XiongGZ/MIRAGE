    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASDs are typically asymptomatic during childhood and become symptomatic in adulthood with exertional dyspnea being the most common symptom. The murmur of ASD is due to increased flow across the pulmonic valve and not due to the shunt itself, which is usually silent. The murmur is typically midsystolic and best heard over the left upper sternal border. Fixed splitting of S2 is the classic finding in ASD and is due to the prolonged right ventricular ejection time caused by the left-to-right shunt. During pregnancy, blood volume and cardiac output increase, leading to increased right ventricular preload and an increase in the left-to-right shunt. This can lead to right heart failure and the onset or worsening of symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increase in blood volume\"}"
