    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of intravenous drug use, fever, and new murmur are highly suggestive of infective endocarditis. The presence of retinal hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth spots) further supports this diagnosis. The tricuspid valve is most commonly affected in endocarditis among intravenous drug users. Blood cultures should be obtained immediately, but empiric antibiotic therapy should not be delayed while awaiting culture results because it can reduce the risk of embolic events. The choice of empiric antibiotics depends on the local prevalence of organisms and resistance patterns. In this patient, who is an intravenous drug user, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) is the most likely pathogen, and Streptococci and other organisms are also possible. Therefore, empiric therapy should include a regimen with MRSA coverage, such as vancomycin or daptomycin, in addition to ceftriaxone for Streptococci coverage until culture results are available.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
