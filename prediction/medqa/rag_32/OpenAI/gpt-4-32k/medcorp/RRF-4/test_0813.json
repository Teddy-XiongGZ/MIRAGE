    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest any secondary causes of hypertension such as primary hyperaldosteronism, hypothyroidism, or aortic stenosis. Primary hyperaldosteronism typically presents with hypokalemia, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Hypothyroidism usually presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance, which are also not mentioned. Aortic stenosis would typically present with a systolic ejection murmur, not an early systolic murmur. Stiffening of the aorta is a common cause of isolated systolic hypertension, particularly in older adults. This occurs due to age-related changes in the vascular system, including loss of elasticity in the aorta and other large arteries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
