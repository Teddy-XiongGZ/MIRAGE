    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The standard error is a measure of the statistical accuracy of an estimate, equal to the standard deviation of the theoretical distribution of a large population of such estimates. In this case, the standard error is used to measure the variability or dispersion of the sample mean. A larger standard error indicates a greater dispersion in the individual measurements in the sample. This could be due to a smaller sample size, as the standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. Therefore, the larger standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group could be due to a smaller sample size in this group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
