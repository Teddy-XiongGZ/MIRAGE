    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue. This description is consistent with a Nabothian cyst, which is a mucus-filled cyst on the surface of the cervix. They are most often caused when stratified squamous epithelium of the ectocervix (portion of the cervix extending into the vagina) grows over the simple columnar epithelium of the endocervix (portion of the cervix facing the uterine cavity), causing retention of cervical mucus in the nabothian glands. Nabothian cysts are a common finding on routine pelvic examination and are considered a normal variant. They are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment unless they are large or symptomatic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. No further intervention\"}"
