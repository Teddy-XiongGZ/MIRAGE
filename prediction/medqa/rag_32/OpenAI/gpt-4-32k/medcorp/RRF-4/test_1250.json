    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient with HIV who is not responding to her current antiretroviral therapy, so her treatment is switched to a drug that prevents viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. This is a key characteristic of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Among the options, Efavirenz is the only NNRTI. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor, Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor, and Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) which requires intracellular phosphorylation to be active.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
