    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which are shockable rhythms. The initial management of these rhythms includes immediate defibrillation. If defibrillation is unsuccessful, intravenous epinephrine should be administered, followed by another attempt at defibrillation. If the arrhythmia persists after the first dose of epinephrine, the antiarrhythmic amiodarone should be administered. Therefore, given that the patient has already received epinephrine and remains in a shockable rhythm, the next step in management should be the administration of amiodarone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Amiodarone\"}"
