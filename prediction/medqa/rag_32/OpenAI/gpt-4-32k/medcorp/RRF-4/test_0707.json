    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea. In such a state, the body tries to conserve as much water and sodium as possible to prevent further fluid loss. The majority of sodium reabsorption in the kidneys occurs in the proximal tubule, where about 65% of the filtered load is reabsorbed. This process is not affected by hormones and occurs regardless of the body's hydration status. Therefore, even in a state of dehydration, the proximal tubule would still be the site of most sodium reabsorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Proximal tubule\"}"
