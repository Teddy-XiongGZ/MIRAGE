    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, which means there is a risk of Rh incompatibility. This can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in subsequent pregnancies if the mother becomes sensitized to the Rh antigen. To prevent this, Rh-negative mothers are given anti-D IgG (Rho(D) immune globulin) during pregnancy and after delivery if the baby is Rh-positive. This prevents the mother's immune system from recognizing the Rh antigen and becoming sensitized to it. The woman is not at risk for ABO incompatibility because she is blood group A and the father is blood group B, so there is no need for anti-A or anti-B IgG. IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta, so anti-D IgM would not be effective in preventing HDN.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
