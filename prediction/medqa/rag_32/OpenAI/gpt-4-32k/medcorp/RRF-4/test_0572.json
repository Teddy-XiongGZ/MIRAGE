    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of working outdoors in Nevada, a sunny state, and the appearance of the rash on his face suggest that he may have rosacea, a common skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels in the face. It may flare up for a period of weeks to months and then diminish for a while. Rosacea can be mistaken for acne, other skin problems or natural ruddiness. The first-line treatment for rosacea includes topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, or ivermectin. Oral tetracycline is used for more severe cases or when the condition doesn't respond to topical treatments. Oral clonidine is used to treat high blood pressure and certain other medical conditions, but it is not typically used to treat skin conditions. Topical benzoyl peroxide is commonly used to treat acne, not rosacea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Topical metronidazole\"}"
