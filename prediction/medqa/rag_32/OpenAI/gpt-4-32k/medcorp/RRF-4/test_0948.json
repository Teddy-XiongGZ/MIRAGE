    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, and he recently had a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). His current symptoms of jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema suggest heart failure. The question asks for the medication that will provide the greatest mortality benefit. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are both commonly used in the management of heart failure and after myocardial infarction. However, among the options, metoprolol succinate, a beta-blocker, and lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, are the two drugs specifically indicated for reducing mortality in heart failure. Between these two, ACE inhibitors have been shown to provide a greater mortality benefit in heart failure patients compared to beta-blockers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
