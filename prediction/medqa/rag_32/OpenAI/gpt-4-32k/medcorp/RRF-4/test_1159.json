Given the recent appendectomy for an abscess, it is likely that the infection is a complication of the surgery. The question asks for a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, which narrows down the options to Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. However, Clostridium perfringens is not typically associated with postoperative infections, while Bacteroides fragilis is a common cause of intra-abdominal infections and abscesses, particularly in the postoperative setting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
