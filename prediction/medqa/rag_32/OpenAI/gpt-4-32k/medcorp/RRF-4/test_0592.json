    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of intravenous drug use and is positive for hepatitis C RNA, indicating a chronic hepatitis C infection. The standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C is a combination of interferon-\u03b1 and another drug. The question asks about the mechanism of the second drug. The second drug used in combination with interferon-\u03b1 for the treatment of hepatitis C is usually ribavirin. Ribavirin is a guanosine analog that inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of guanosine nucleotides. By inhibiting this enzyme, ribavirin depletes the intracellular pool of guanosine triphosphate, which is necessary for the synthesis of viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
