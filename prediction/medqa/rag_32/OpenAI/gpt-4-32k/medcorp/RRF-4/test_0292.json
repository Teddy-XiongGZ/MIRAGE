    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium, which is likely an atrial myxoma based on the description. Atrial myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors and can lead to various complications depending on their size, mobility, and location. They can obstruct blood flow, leading to symptoms mimicking mitral stenosis or heart failure. They can also embolize, leading to systemic or pulmonary emboli. Given the size and location of the tumor in this patient, the most likely risk is embolization, which could lead to acute arterial occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
