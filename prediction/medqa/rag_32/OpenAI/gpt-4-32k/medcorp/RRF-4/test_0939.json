SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect any part of the body, but often harms the heart, joints, skin, lungs, blood vessels, liver, kidneys, and nervous system. The disease is characterized by periods of illness and remissions. It is nine times more common in women than in men, especially in women in child-bearing years ages 15 to 35, and is also more common in those of non-European descent. The exact cause of SLE is unknown, but several factors have been associated with the disease, including genetics, environment, and hormones. In SLE, the immune system produces autoantibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue. These autoantibodies cause inflammation, pain, and damage in various parts of the body. In terms of laboratory findings, SLE is often associated with a decreased lymphocyte count due to the autoimmune nature of the disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
