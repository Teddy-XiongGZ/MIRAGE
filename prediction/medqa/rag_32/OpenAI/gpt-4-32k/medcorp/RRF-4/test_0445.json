    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has swelling in her right leg without pain, erythema, or pitting edema. This could be a sign of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially considering her recent surgery, which is a risk factor for DVT. Homan's sign is not a reliable test for DVT. The most appropriate next step would be to confirm the diagnosis with imaging. Compression ultrasonography is the first-line imaging study for suspected DVT. CT pulmonary angiography would be more appropriate if there was a high suspicion for a pulmonary embolism, which this patient does not have symptoms of. D-dimer level can be used to rule out DVT in patients with a low pretest probability, but given this patient's recent surgery, her pretest probability is not low. Blood cultures would be more appropriate if there was a suspicion for infection, but this patient's presentation does not strongly suggest an infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
