    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is characterized by heartburn and regurgitation due to the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus. The patient was initially on cimetidine, which is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist that works by reducing the production of stomach acid. However, his symptoms have worsened, indicating that a stronger medication is needed. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are often used in such cases. PPIs work by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme (proton pump) in the stomach's parietal cells, which is responsible for the final step in the production of gastric acid. This results in a more pronounced and longer-lasting reduction in stomach acid production compared to H2 receptor antagonists.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells\"}"
