    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-year-old boy who has been experiencing bedwetting at night. He has no history of urinary incontinence during the day, urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy. His physical examination and laboratory investigations are normal. This suggests that the boy has primary nocturnal enuresis, a common condition in children that often resolves with time. The first line of treatment for this condition is reassurance and behavioral modifications, such as the use of an enuresis alarm. This device wakes the child when it detects moisture, helping the child associate the sensation of a full bladder with waking up and going to the bathroom. Other treatments, such as medications, are usually considered if behavioral interventions are not successful.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
