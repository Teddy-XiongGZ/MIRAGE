    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) is a protein that inhibits neutrophil elastase, an enzyme that can degrade lung tissue. In individuals with A1AT deficiency, there is an imbalance between protease and antiprotease activity in the lungs, leading to lung damage and conditions like emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoking can exacerbate this condition by increasing the inflammatory reaction in the airways and directly inactivating A1AT, further tipping the balance in favor of elastase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Elastase\"}"
