    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include leg pain during play, a difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs, a delay in the pulse between the brachial and femoral arteries, a loud S1 and S2, and an S4. Auscultation reveals an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area, and a chest X-ray shows rib notching. These symptoms are indicative of a condition that affects blood flow from the heart to the lower body. Document [17] describes aortic regurgitation, which can present with a wide pulse pressure and a low pitched early diastolic murmur, but this does not match the patient's symptoms. Document [3] describes coarctation of the aorta in older children, which can present with leg discomfort during exercise, a difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower extremities, and a murmur in the left interscapular area of the back. This matches the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is coarctation of the aorta.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
