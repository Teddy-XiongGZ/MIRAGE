The most common triggers are medications, foods, and insect stings. In this case, the patient's anaphylaxis was likely triggered by the blood transfusion, which can cause a type II hypersensitivity reaction. This reaction occurs when IgM or IgG antibodies bind to foreign cells, leading to their destruction. In the case of a blood transfusion, the patient's preformed anti-A, B, or O antibodies can bind to the transfused red blood cells and cause their destruction, leading to a transfusion reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
