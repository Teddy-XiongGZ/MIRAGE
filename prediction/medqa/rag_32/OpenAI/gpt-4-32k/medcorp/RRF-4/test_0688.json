Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis that develops in individuals with high levels of uric acid in the blood. The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate confirms the diagnosis of gout. The underlying cause of gout can be due to overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and smoking can contribute to increased uric acid levels. Alcohol, particularly beer, is high in purines, substances that are metabolized into uric acid in the body. However, the most common cause of hyperuricemia and gout is not overproduction of uric acid, but decreased renal excretion of uric acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
