    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a penetrating chest wound and unstable vital signs, indicating a severe injury. The echocardiography reveals a full-thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall, which is a life-threatening condition. Immediate intervention is required to control the bleeding and repair the injury. A cardiac transplant (Choice A) is not a feasible or appropriate immediate response to this acute situation. Watchful waiting (Choice B) is not appropriate given the severity of the injury and the patient's unstable condition. Needle thoracostomy (Choice D) is typically used for tension pneumothorax, not for cardiac injuries. Therefore, the most appropriate surgical approach would be to repair the injury using sutures, as described in Choice C. This approach is supported by several case reports in the provided documents, where similar injuries were successfully managed with sutures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
