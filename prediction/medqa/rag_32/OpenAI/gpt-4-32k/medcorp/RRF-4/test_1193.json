    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 47/mm3, which is significantly below the normal range of \u2265 500/mm3. This indicates severe immunosuppression. In patients with HIV and CD4 counts <200/mm3, prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended. In patients with CD4 counts <50/mm3, prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex with azithromycin is recommended. The patient's CD4 count is 47/mm3, so he falls into this category. Therefore, the patient should be started on both trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin\"}"
