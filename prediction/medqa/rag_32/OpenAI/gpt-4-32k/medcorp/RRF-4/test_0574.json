    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient with symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours. The loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes is associated with increased permeability to proteins, leading to proteinuria. Among the given options, selective albuminuria would be the most indicative of this condition. WBC casts in the urine are more indicative of a urinary tract infection or interstitial nephritis. Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine are associated with gout, not nephrotic syndrome. Bence-Jones proteinuria is associated with multiple myeloma, not nephrotic syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
