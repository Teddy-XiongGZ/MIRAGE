    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ejection fraction is a measure of the heart's efficiency and is calculated as the stroke volume divided by the end-diastolic volume. Stroke volume is the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume. However, the question does not provide enough information to calculate the ejection fraction as the end-diastolic volume is not given.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
