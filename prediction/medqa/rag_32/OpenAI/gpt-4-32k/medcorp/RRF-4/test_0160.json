    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the function of the spleen and how it relates to the patient's susceptibility to certain infections. The spleen plays a crucial role in filtering the blood and removing old or damaged red blood cells. It also plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly against encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The spleen is divided into two main functional areas: the white pulp (1) and the red pulp (2). The white pulp is involved in the immune response, producing lymphocytes and antibodies. The red pulp is involved in filtering the blood, removing old or damaged red blood cells. Therefore, dysfunction in both areas (1 and 2) would predispose the patient to the aforementioned infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1 and 2\"}"
