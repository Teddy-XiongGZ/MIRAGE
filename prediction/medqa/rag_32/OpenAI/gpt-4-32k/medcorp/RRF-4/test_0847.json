    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor. It works by reducing the production of stomach acid by blocking the enzyme in the wall of the stomach that produces acid. This is not related to parasympathetic inhibition or inhibition of the 50S ribosomal subunit. It also does not block H2 receptors, but rather inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This means it inhibits the final step in gastric acid production, which is a form of primary active transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
