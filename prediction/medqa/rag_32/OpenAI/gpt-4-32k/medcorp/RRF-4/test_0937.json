    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is suggestive of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, which is characterized by pruritus and jaundice in the second half of pregnancy. It is associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including preterm birth, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, and fetal distress. The condition is more common in women with a personal or family history of the disease, those carrying multiple gestations, and those with a history of cholestasis while taking oral contraceptives. The patient's age and nulliparity are not risk factors for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. A history of preeclampsia in a sibling is a risk factor for preeclampsia, not intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Therefore, the patient's history in the previous pregnancy is the risk factor for her current condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
