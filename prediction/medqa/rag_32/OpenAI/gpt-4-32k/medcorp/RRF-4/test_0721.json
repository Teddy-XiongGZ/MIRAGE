    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest a condition called hydrocephalus, which is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. This can occur due to an obstruction in the flow of CSF, overproduction of CSF, or problems with absorption. The MRI shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle, which suggests that the obstruction is occurring at a location where CSF exits this ventricle. The CSF flows from the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro). Therefore, an obstruction at this location would cause a buildup of CSF in the left lateral ventricle, leading to its dilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Interventricular foramen\"}"
