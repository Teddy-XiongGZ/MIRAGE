    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of fever, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness is suggestive of meningitis. The CSF analysis shows a mildly elevated cell count, which is indicative of an inflammatory process in the meninges. The glucose level is normal, which makes bacterial meningitis less likely, as bacteria would consume glucose in the CSF. The normal protein level also makes bacterial meningitis less likely, as bacterial infections usually cause a significant increase in protein levels. The most likely diagnosis in this case is viral meningitis, which is most commonly caused by the herpes simplex virus. Therefore, the best treatment would be acyclovir, which is an antiviral medication effective against herpes simplex virus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
