    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ACGME has set standards for resident work hours to ensure both the quality of medical education and the safety of patients. According to the documents, the ACGME limits the workweek to 80 hours, averaged over 4 weeks. This includes both internal and external moonlighting. The resident in question is currently working 60 hours per week in his residency program and an additional 10 hours per week moonlighting, totaling 70 hours per week. This is under the 80-hour limit set by the ACGME. Therefore, he could technically work up to an additional 10 hours per week while still adhering to ACGME guidelines.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
