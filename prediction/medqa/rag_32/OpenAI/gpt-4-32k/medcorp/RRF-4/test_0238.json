    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between the time period chosen for the study and the incidence and prevalence rates of SLE. Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that occur in a population during a specific time period, while prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a specific point in time. If the time period for the study is shorter, there would be fewer new cases, and therefore the incidence would be lower. On the other hand, the prevalence would be overestimated in shorter time periods because it includes all cases, not just new ones. Therefore, the statement that the prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated is true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
