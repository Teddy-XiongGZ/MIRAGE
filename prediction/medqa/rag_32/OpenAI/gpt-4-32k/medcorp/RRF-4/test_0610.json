    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is RhD negative and her previous child was RhD positive, which means she is at risk of developing anti-D antibodies during her current pregnancy. However, her anti-D antibody screen is currently negative, indicating that she has not yet developed these antibodies. The best next step in management is to repeat the antibody screening at 28 weeks to check if she has developed anti-D antibodies. If the screen is still negative, she should receive prophylactic anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks to prevent sensitization for the rest of the pregnancy. After delivery, if the newborn is RhD positive, she should receive another dose of anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent sensitization from any fetal blood cells that may have entered her circulation during delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
