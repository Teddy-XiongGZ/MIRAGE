    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the new experimental drug increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation. Incretins are a group of metabolic hormones that stimulate a decrease in blood glucose levels. In the provided documents, it is mentioned that DPP-4 inhibitors prevent the degradation of incretins, thereby increasing their levels. This mechanism is similar to the one described for the new experimental drug. Among the provided options, Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, as mentioned in Document 5 and Document 25. Therefore, Sitagliptin has a mechanism of action most similar to the new experimental drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
