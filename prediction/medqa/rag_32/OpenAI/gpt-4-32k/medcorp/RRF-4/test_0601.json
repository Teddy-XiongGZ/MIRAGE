    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the event that occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter release is a process that is triggered by the influx of calcium ions into the presynaptic neuron. This is a well-known mechanism in neuroscience. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing calcium ions to enter the neuron. The influx of calcium then triggers the fusion of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, leading to the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. None of the other options (activation of G protein-coupled receptors, accumulation of cAMP, opening of ligand-gated ion channels) directly precede neurotransmitter release.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
