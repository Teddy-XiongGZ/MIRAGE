    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and painful ejaculation are suggestive of a prostatic issue. The presence of white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion indicates inflammation of the prostate. However, the negative culture results rule out a bacterial cause, such as chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli. Benign prostatic hyperplasia usually presents with obstructive symptoms, which this patient does not have. Interstitial cystitis is a possibility, but it is more common in women and usually presents with bladder pain and urgency, which this patient does not report. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
