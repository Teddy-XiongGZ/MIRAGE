    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's stone was composed of calcium oxalate. According to Document [27], a diet rich in calcium is useful to prevent kidney stones. Therefore, decreasing calcium intake (Choice A) is not the correct answer. Document [27] also suggests that a restriction of sodium intake is useful in limiting urinary calcium excretion, which may be helpful for the prevention of nephrolithiasis. Therefore, decreasing sodium intake (Choice B) could be a beneficial intervention for this patient. Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds (Choice C) is not mentioned in the documents as a preventive measure for kidney stones. Lastly, urine acidification with cranberry juice (Choice D) is not mentioned in the documents as a preventive measure for kidney stones, and it could potentially increase the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation as a more acidic urine pH can promote the precipitation of calcium oxalate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
