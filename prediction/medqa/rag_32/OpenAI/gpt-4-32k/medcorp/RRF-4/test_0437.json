    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a woman with a lump in her breast that was found to be invasive ductal carcinoma on biopsy. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer. Overexpression of the HER2 gene is often seen in this type of cancer. BCR-ABL is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, not breast cancer. BRCA-2 mutations can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, but they are not typically overexpressed in the cancer cells. BCL-2 is an anti-apoptotic gene that can be overexpressed in some cancers, but it is not specifically associated with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
