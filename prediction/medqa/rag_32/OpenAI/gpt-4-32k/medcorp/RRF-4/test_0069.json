The CT scan shows a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase, which is a typical feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, HCC can be diagnosed noninvasively in cirrhotic patients with a liver mass >1 cm that shows arterial phase hyperenhancement and 'washout' on delayed phase imaging. However, in this case, there is no hypodense attenuation seen on the venous or delayed phase, which means the imaging does not meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of HCC. Therefore, a liver biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
