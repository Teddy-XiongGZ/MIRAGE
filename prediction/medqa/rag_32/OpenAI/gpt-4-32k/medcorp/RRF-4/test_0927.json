    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of sudden severe pain in the great toe, along with the history of severe joint pain in the knee, and the presence of high serum uric acid levels, are indicative of gout. Gout is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints due to hyperuricemia. The long-term management of gout involves reducing serum uric acid levels. This can be achieved by either increasing the renal excretion of uric acid or by decreasing its production. The most commonly used drugs for decreasing uric acid production are xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which block the enzyme involved in the final steps of uric acid formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase\"}"
