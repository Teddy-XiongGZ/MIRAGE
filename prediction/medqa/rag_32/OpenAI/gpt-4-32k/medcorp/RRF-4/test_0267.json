    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that it is carried on the X chromosome. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. If a male has the disease, it means he has the affected gene on his X chromosome. When he has children, he will pass on either his X or his Y chromosome. If he passes on the X chromosome, the child will be a female and will be a carrier of the disease, because she receives one X chromosome from her mother (which is unaffected) and one X chromosome from her father (which carries the disease). Therefore, all daughters of a man with hemophilia A are carriers of the disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 100%\"}"
