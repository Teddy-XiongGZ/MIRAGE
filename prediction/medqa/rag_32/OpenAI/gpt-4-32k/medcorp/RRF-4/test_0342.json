    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is consistent with tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and increases intrathoracic pressure. This can lead to decreased venous return to the heart, causing hypotension and potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse. The classic findings of tension pneumothorax include hypotension, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation away from the affected side, all of which are present in this patient. Immediate decompression with needle thoracostomy is the treatment of choice to prevent cardiovascular collapse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
