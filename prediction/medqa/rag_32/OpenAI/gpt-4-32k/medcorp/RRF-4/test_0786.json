    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of abnormal coagulation tests and the current presentation of a swollen, erythematous knee after a fall suggest a bleeding disorder. The lab results show a normal bleeding time and prothrombin time, but an elevated partial thromboplastin time. This indicates a defect in the intrinsic or common pathway of coagulation. Bradykinin formation is decreased, which suggests a defect in the contact activation pathway, which includes Factor XII. Therefore, the most likely defective factor in this patient is Factor XII.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Factor XII\"}"
