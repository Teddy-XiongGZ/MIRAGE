    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn boy was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. He was evaluated for tachypnea six hours after birth. His respiratory rate was 75/min and physical examination showed increased work of breathing. These symptoms are consistent with transient tachypnea of the newborn, a condition that usually occurs within the first two hours of birth in full term and late term newborn infants, as mentioned in Document [0]. The boy was started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, which likely is nitric oxide, a potent pulmonary vasodilator used to treat newborns with persistent pulmonary hypertension. However, three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes, which is a sign of cyanosis. Cyanosis is caused by an increased concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood, which can occur when hemoglobin is oxidized from the ferrous state (Fe2+) to the ferric state (Fe3+), forming methemoglobin. Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen, leading to functional anemia and cyanosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
