    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of yellowish discoloration of his skin and generalized pruritus, along with the physical examination findings of jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus, indicate that he has jaundice. Jaundice is caused by an increase in bilirubin levels in the body. The urinalysis findings of an elevated concentration of bilirubin and a low concentration of urobilinogen suggest that the jaundice is due to a problem with the excretion of bilirubin into the bile, rather than an increase in the production of bilirubin (which would be suggested by an increase in urobilinogen). This is because bilirubin is normally excreted into the bile by the liver, and then converted into urobilinogen by bacteria in the intestine. If there is a problem with the excretion of bilirubin into the bile, then less bilirubin will reach the intestine and be converted into urobilinogen. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's findings is defective hepatic bile excretion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
