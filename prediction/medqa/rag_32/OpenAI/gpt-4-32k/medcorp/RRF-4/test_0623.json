    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study design described involves identifying a group of individuals with a specific condition (interstitial lung disease) and a group without the condition. The investigators then look back in time to assess exposure to a specific risk factor (the fire retardant chemical). This is characteristic of a case-control study, where 'cases' are individuals with the disease and 'controls' are those without. The exposure status is then compared between these two groups. This is not a case series because there is a comparison group (those without interstitial lung disease). It's not a retrospective cohort study because the individuals are selected based on their disease status, not their exposure status. Finally, it's not a randomized controlled trial because there is no intervention being tested and the participants are not randomly assigned to exposure groups.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
