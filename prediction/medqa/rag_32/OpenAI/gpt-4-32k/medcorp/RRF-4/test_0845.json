    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which tissue transplant would most likely promote healing in athletes with cartilaginous injury. The options are perichondrium, proteoglycans, osteoblasts, and mature chondrocytes. Perichondrium is a membrane that covers cartilage, proteoglycans are proteins that are heavily glycosylated and are a major component of the extracellular matrix, osteoblasts are cells that form new bone, and mature chondrocytes are cells found in healthy cartilage. The documents suggest that autologous chondrocyte transplantation or implantation has been used successfully to treat cartilage lesions and injuries. This involves taking chondrocytes from the patient's own body and implanting them into the area of injury to promote healing. Therefore, the transplantation of mature chondrocytes would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
