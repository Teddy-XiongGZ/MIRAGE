    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the urinary concentration of sodium decreases and potassium increases. This suggests that the compound is acting on cells that have a role in sodium and potassium regulation. The principal cells in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct are responsible for this regulation. Therefore, the compound is likely acting on the principal cells. Now, we need to identify the compound. Aldosterone typically increases sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, which would increase urinary potassium but decrease urinary sodium. This matches the effects observed in the question. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, so it would have the opposite effect, increasing sodium and decreasing potassium in the urine. Therefore, the compound is likely aldosterone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Principal cells; aldosterone\"}"
