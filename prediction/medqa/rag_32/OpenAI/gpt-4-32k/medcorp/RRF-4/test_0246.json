The next step in management should be to confirm the diagnosis. According to the modified Duke criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, two separate positive blood cultures of a typical microorganism (such as Staphylococcus aureus) are required. Therefore, repeating the blood cultures would be the most appropriate next step. The timing of the repeat cultures is not specified in the criteria, but they are typically drawn 12-24 hours after the initial set.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
