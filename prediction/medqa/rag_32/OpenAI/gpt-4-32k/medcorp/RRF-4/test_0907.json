    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of retrosternal pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations that occur with exertion and resolve with rest are suggestive of angina pectoris, a symptom of coronary artery disease. The fact that these episodes are increasing in frequency indicates that her condition may be worsening. Given her history of hypertension and diabetes, she is at an increased risk for coronary artery disease. Despite her ECG and cardiac markers being normal, these tests can sometimes be normal in patients with angina, especially if they are done when the patient is at rest and not experiencing symptoms. Therefore, further testing is needed to evaluate for possible coronary artery disease. A myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress would be an appropriate next step, as it can help identify areas of the heart that may not be getting enough blood flow during times of stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
