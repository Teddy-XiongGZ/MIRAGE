    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has active bleeding from scalp and trunk lacerations due to a motor vehicle accident. This would lead to a decrease in blood volume, which would be sensed by baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus. Normally, these baroreceptors send a constant stream of signals to the brain, and a decrease in firing rate due to decreased stretch from lower blood volume is interpreted by the brain as hypotension. The body would respond by increasing sympathetic outflow and decreasing parasympathetic outflow. This would lead to vasoconstriction to increase blood pressure, not vasodilation. The sympathetic nervous system would also increase heart rate by increasing the release of norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node, the heart's natural pacemaker. Acetylcholine, released by the parasympathetic nervous system, would decrease heart rate, but we would expect parasympathetic activity to decrease in this situation. Atrial natriuretic peptide is released in response to increased blood volume and would lead to vasodilation and decreased blood pressure, which is the opposite of what we would expect in this situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
