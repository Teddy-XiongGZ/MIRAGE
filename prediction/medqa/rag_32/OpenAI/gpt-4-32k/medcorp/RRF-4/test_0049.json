    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs. The alveoli are lined by two types of cells: type I and type II pneumocytes. Type I pneumocytes are involved in the process of gas exchange, while type II pneumocytes secrete surfactant, which reduces surface tension and prevents the alveoli from collapsing. When damage occurs to the alveoli, type II pneumocytes proliferate and differentiate into type I pneumocytes to replace the damaged cells and restore the alveolar lining. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that mentions the proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells, which are type II pneumocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
