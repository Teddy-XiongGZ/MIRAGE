    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a simple way of classifying the extent of heart failure. It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regard to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and/or angina pain. Class I is for patients with no limitation of physical activity. Class II is for patients with slight limitation of physical activity. Class III is for patients with marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV is for patients who are unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. In this case, the patient is unable to perform simple tasks without discomfort, which indicates a marked limitation of physical activity. Therefore, she falls into the NYHA Class III category.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
