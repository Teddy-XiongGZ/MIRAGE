    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of personality changes, irritability, aggression, impulsivity, and jerky movements of the limbs and trunk, along with a family history of dementia, are suggestive of Huntington's disease. This is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. The disease is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal form of the huntingtin protein. This protein accumulates in neurons, causing cell death particularly in the striatum, a part of the brain involved in controlling movement. Therefore, the most likely change on MRI would be atrophy of the striatum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Atrophy of the striatum\"}"
