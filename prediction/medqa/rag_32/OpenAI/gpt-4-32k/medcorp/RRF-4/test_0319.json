    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of mood fluctuations, a recent episode of minimal sleep and high energy, and a history of multiple month-long episodes of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty, all point towards a mood disorder. The fact that these episodes are interspersed with periods of normal mood and the presence of at least one episode of elevated mood (hypomania) and one episode of depressed mood lasting at least two weeks, makes bipolar II disorder the most likely diagnosis. Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by at least two years of numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms, but the symptoms do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a depressive mood that lasts for at least two years, and patients may have periods of normal mood, but these periods last no longer than two months. Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by a mood disorder and schizophrenia symptoms, but the patient does not have any symptoms of schizophrenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
