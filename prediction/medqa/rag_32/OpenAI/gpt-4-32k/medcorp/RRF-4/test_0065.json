    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of lung cancer and the nature of his back pain, which is worse at night, raises suspicion for metastatic disease. Lung cancer is known to commonly metastasize to the bones, including the spine. The presence of point tenderness along the lumbosacral area further supports this suspicion. A bulging disc or narrowing of the lumbar disc space would likely cause radicular symptoms, which the patient does not report. Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine are not typically associated with lung cancer. Therefore, the most likely imaging finding would be lytic lesions of the lumbar spine, which are characteristic of bone metastases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
