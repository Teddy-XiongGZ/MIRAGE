    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and started on a 4-drug regimen. He became sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reported significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removed pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and added antiretroviral therapy. After 3 weeks, the patient presented with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is increased, CD4+ T cell count is increased, and HIV RNA is decreased. These findings suggest that the patient's symptoms are not due to a failure of the antitubercular therapy or antiretroviral therapy, but rather due to an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is a paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected individuals. It occurs as a result of the rapid restoration of pathogen-specific immune responses. In this case, the patient's tuberculosis appears to have worsened after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, suggesting a diagnosis of tuberculosis-associated IRIS. The most appropriate initial step in treatment is to continue both antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
