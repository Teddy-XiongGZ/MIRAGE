    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath, along with the physical examination finding of a harsh pansystolic murmur over the left sternal border, suggest a congenital heart defect. The murmur becoming louder when the patient squats indicates that it is likely a left-to-right shunt, as squatting increases systemic vascular resistance and thus increases the shunt. The location of the murmur at the 2nd-3rd intercostal space on the left sternal border is consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSDs are caused by a defect in the formation of the interventricular septum, which is derived from the endocardial cushion. Therefore, the endocardial cushion is the structure that gives rise to the defective structure causing this patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
