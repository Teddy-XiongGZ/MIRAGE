    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a child with a large, necrotic tumor on the left kidney, with histological examination showing primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. These findings are characteristic of a Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, which is a malignant renal tumor of childhood that typically presents as an asymptomatic abdominal mass. Wilms tumor arises from metanephric blastema, a component of the intermediate mesoderm that gives rise to the kidneys. Therefore, the tissue is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as the adrenal medulla, which also originates from the intermediate mesoderm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Adrenal medulla\"}"
