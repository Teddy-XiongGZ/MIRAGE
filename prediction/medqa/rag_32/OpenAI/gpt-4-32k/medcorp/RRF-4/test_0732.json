    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of intravenous drug use, fever, and severe neck pain with signs of inflammation on MRI are suggestive of vertebral osteomyelitis. This condition is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), especially in patients with a history of intravenous drug use. Therefore, empiric antibiotic therapy should cover MRSA and typically includes vancomycin. However, because the patient's history of drug use also puts him at risk for infections with gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an antipseudomonal agent such as ciprofloxacin should also be included in the empiric regimen. Lumbar puncture is not indicated because there are no signs of meningitis. Oral indomethacin would not be appropriate because this is likely an infectious process, not a simple inflammatory one. Bone scintigraphy could be used for diagnosis, but in this case, the diagnosis has already been confirmed with MRI and bone biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
