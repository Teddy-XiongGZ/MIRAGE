    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of vertigo, vomiting, hearing loss, and a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane suggest a diagnosis of acute otitis media with complications, possibly labyrinthitis or mastoiditis. The elevated white blood cell count and neutrophil percentage also suggest a bacterial infection. The most common pathogens in acute otitis media are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefepime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, but it is usually reserved for severe or hospital-acquired infections. Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin that also has broad coverage, but it is typically used for severe infections like meningitis. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin that primarily covers gram-positive bacteria and is not typically used for otitis media. Amoxicillin, a penicillin antibiotic, is the first-line treatment for otitis media as it covers the most common pathogens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
