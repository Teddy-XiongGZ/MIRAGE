    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's age and the presence of a painless testicular mass suggest a testicular germ cell tumor. The biopsy findings of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells, are characteristic of Schiller-Duval bodies, which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors. The elevated AFP levels further support this diagnosis, as yolk sac tumors often secrete AFP. The normal hCG levels make choriocarcinoma less likely. Seminomas and teratomas do not typically present with elevated AFP levels or Schiller-Duval bodies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Yolk sac tumor\"}"
