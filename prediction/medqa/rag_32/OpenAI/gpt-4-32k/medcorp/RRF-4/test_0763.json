    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe memory loss, confusion, confabulation, and horizontal nystagmus, along with his history of chronic alcoholism, suggest a diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiamine is a cofactor for several key enzymes in the body, including the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA in the citric acid cycle. Therefore, the reaction that the deficient vitamin mediates in this case is Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
