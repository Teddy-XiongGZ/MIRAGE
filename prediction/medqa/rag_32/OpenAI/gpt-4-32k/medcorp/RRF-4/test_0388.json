    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 8-week-old male who is breastfeeding every 2-3 hours and has episodes of regurgitation through his nose and mouth after some feeds. He is mildly upset during these episodes but settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The mother has tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. The patient's growth percentiles are within normal range, although there has been a slight decrease. The physical exam is normal. These findings are consistent with physiological gastroesophageal reflux, which is common in infants and usually resolves by 12-18 months of age. The best next step in management is to provide reassurance and counseling on positioning during feeds and after feeds to minimize reflux.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
