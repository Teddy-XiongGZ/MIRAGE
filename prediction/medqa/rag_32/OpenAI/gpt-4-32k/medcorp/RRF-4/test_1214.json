    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of right lower abdominal pain, generalized fatigue, and decreasing urinary output, along with the physical examination finding of tenderness at the graft site, suggest a complication related to the recent kidney transplant. The biopsy result of tubulitis, which is inflammation of the renal tubules, is a key feature of acute cellular rejection. This type of rejection is mediated by recipient T cells that infiltrate the graft and cause tissue injury. The negative C4d staining helps to rule out antibody-mediated rejection, which would be suggested by positive staining. Therefore, the patient's findings are most likely due to recipient T cells in the graft.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
