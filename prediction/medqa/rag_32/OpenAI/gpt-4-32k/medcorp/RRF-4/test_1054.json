    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of pain and weakness in the right shoulder, especially after physical exertion, suggest a musculoskeletal injury. The physical exam findings of weakness in external rotation and sudden dropping of the arm when lowered from an overhead position are indicative of a rotator cuff injury. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. The supraspinatus muscle is most commonly injured, often due to its position and the forces it withstands during overhead activities. However, the patient's specific weakness in external rotation suggests involvement of the infraspinatus or teres minor, as these muscles primarily function in external rotation of the shoulder. The deltoid muscle is primarily responsible for arm abduction, but the patient's strength was noted to be 1/5 for abduction, which suggests that the injury is not primarily in the deltoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Infraspinatus\"}"
