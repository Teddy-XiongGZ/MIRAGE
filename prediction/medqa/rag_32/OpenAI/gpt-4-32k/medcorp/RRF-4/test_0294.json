    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a biopsy sample from the mainstem bronchus showing uniform squamous cells in layers. Normally, the bronchial epithelium is lined by pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium, not squamous cells. The presence of squamous cells in the bronchus indicates a change in the normal cell type, which is a process known as metaplasia. Metaplasia is a reversible change in which one adult cell type (epithelial or mesenchymal) is replaced by another adult cell type. It often occurs in response to chronic irritation and inflammation and allows for a more robust cell type to defend the tissue. Therefore, the histologic finding in this patient is best described as metaplasia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
