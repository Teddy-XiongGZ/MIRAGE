Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. In pregnant women, the recommended treatment for Lyme disease is amoxicillin. Tetracycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of discoloration of the developing teeth and potential bone growth retardation in the fetus.
