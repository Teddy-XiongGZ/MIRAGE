    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history of pesticide exposure suggest poisoning by sodium fluoroacetate, which forms fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms.

Therefore, if aconitase is inhibited, citrate will accumulate in the cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Citrate\"}"
