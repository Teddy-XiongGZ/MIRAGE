    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision, which are more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze. These symptoms suggest a neurological issue. The patient's history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, ischemic heart disease, and previous ischemic stroke also point towards a possible neurological condition. The examination of extraocular movements shows an issue with eye movement, which is controlled by cranial nerves and brain structures involved in gaze. The medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) is a pair of tracts that allows for coordinated movement of the eyes. Lesions in the MLF can cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia, a condition characterized by the inability to move the eye towards the nose, but preserved ability to move the eye away from the nose. This matches the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Medial longitudinal fasciculus\"}"
