    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a young woman with severe headache associated with chewing. The pain is located over the sides of her head and is worsened when she opens and closes her mouth. This suggests that the pain is related to the movement of the jaw. Migraine headaches are typically throbbing and often associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound, which are not mentioned in this case. Temporal arteritis typically occurs in older adults and is associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and muscle pain. Tension headaches are typically described as a band-like pain around the head, not specifically associated with chewing. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is temporomandibular joint dysfunction, which can cause pain in the jaw, particularly with movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
