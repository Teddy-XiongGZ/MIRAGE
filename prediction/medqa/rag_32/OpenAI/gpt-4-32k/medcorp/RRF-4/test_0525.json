    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fatigue and dizziness, along with his laboratory findings of lymphocytosis (50% lymphocytes), anemia (hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 120,000/mm^3), suggest a hematologic disorder. The presence of moderate hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy further supports this. The flow cytometry test showing CD20+ cells indicates a B-cell disorder. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is characterized by an increased number of mature lymphocytes (usually B cells that are CD20+), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. A characteristic finding in CLL is the presence of smudge cells on peripheral blood smear.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Presence of smudge cells\"}"
