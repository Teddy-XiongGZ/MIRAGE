    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of alcoholism, splenomegaly, and a positive fluid wave on physical examination suggest the presence of portal hypertension. The endoscopic findings of bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus are consistent with esophageal varices, which are a common complication of portal hypertension. The goal of treatment in this case is to reduce portal pressure. Phentolamine and prazosin are alpha-adrenergic blockers, and nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker; none of these medications are typically used to reduce portal pressure. Nadolol, on the other hand, is a non-selective beta blocker that can reduce portal pressure by decreasing cardiac output and causing splanchnic vasoconstriction. Therefore, nadolol would be the appropriate pharmacologic agent to use in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
