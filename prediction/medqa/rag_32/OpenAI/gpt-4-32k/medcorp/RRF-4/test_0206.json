    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The LOD (logarithm of odds) score is a statistical estimate that geneticists use to determine whether two loci (the position of genes on a chromosome) are likely to lie near each other on a chromosome and are therefore likely to be inherited together. A LOD score of 3 or more is generally taken to indicate that the two loci are close together, or linked. Therefore, a LOD score greater than 3 would suggest a high probability of the \u0394F508 mutation and the novel mutation being closely linked.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. LOD Score > 3\"}"
