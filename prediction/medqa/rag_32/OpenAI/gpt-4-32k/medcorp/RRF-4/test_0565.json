The presence of mature lymphocytes that rupture easily (smudge cells) on blood smear and flow cytometry findings of lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23 are characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The treatment of CLL depends on the stage of the disease and the patient's symptoms. Asymptomatic early-stage CLL is typically managed with observation and monitoring for disease progression.
