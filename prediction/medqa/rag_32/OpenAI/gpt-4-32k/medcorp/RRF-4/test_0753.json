    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's prematurity, respiratory distress, and characteristic chest x-ray findings suggest a diagnosis of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is caused by surfactant deficiency, which results in atelectasis, reduced lung compliance, and impaired gas exchange. The chest x-ray in RDS typically shows diffuse bilateral atelectasis, resulting in a ground-glass appearance with air bronchograms. The definitive diagnosis of RDS is made by lung biopsy, which shows hyaline membranes lining the alveoli.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy\"}"
