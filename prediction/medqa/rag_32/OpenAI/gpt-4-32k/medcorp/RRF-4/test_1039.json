    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, early morning awakenings, and discomfort in the legs that is relieved by movement are consistent with restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS is a common sensorimotor disorder that often disrupts sleep. The pathophysiology of RLS is related to dopaminergic dysfunction and iron metabolism. The patient's normal iron studies rule out iron deficiency, a common secondary cause of RLS. The first-line treatment for RLS is dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is pramipexole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pramipexole\"}"
