    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of nocturnal cough relieved by sitting upright, crackles over the lung bases, and tender hepatomegaly are suggestive of congestive heart failure. The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide and enlarged left atrium on echocardiogram further support this diagnosis. The patient's ejection fraction is preserved, indicating that he has heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Sacubitril, in combination with valsartan (sacubitril/valsartan), is a novel drug used in the treatment of heart failure. Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of beneficial vasodilatory peptides, which can lead to arterial and venous dilation and reduction of fluid volume, preload, and afterload. This mechanism complements the action of valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, which also leads to vasodilation and reduction of fluid volume. Therefore, sacubitril/valsartan is a good choice for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
