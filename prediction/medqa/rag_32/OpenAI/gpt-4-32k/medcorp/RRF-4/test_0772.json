    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and the positive scotch tape test suggest a diagnosis of pinworm infection. The first-line treatment for pinworm infection is usually albendazole or mebendazole. However, the patient has a documented allergy to albendazole. Therefore, an alternative medication needs to be considered. Ivermectin is used for conditions such as scabies and river blindness, not for pinworm infection.
