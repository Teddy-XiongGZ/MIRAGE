    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region, along with the physical examination findings of lower abdominal tenderness with a distended urinary bladder, suggest urinary retention. This is further confirmed by the ultrasound examination showing an overdistended urinary bladder. The patient's medical history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus could have led to diabetic neuropathy, which can cause bladder dysfunction.

Therefore, the next step in managing this patient should be bladder catheterization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
