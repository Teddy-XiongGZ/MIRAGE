    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old boy who has undergone surgery for severe internal bleeding due to trauma from a motor vehicle accident. After surgery, he is observed to have target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. These findings suggest that the patient may be at risk for infection, which is a common complication after surgery. Therefore, it is likely that the patient was started on a prophylactic antibiotic regimen to prevent infection. Looking at the options, 30S and 50S ribosome inhibitors, cell wall cross-linking inhibitors, and DNA gyrase inhibitors are all classes of antibiotics. 30S ribosome inhibitors include drugs like aminoglycosides and tetracyclines. 50S ribosome inhibitors include drugs like macrolides, lincosamides, and chloramphenicol. Cell wall cross-linking inhibitors include drugs like penicillins and cephalosporins. DNA gyrase inhibitors include drugs like fluoroquinolones. In pediatric patients, penicillins and cephalosporins are commonly used because they have a broad spectrum of activity and are generally safe. Therefore, the most likely drug prescribed in this case would be a cell wall cross-linking inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
