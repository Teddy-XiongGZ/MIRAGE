    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include lack of menarche, normal breast development, scant axillary hair, a firm, nontender left inguinal mass, and a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. This suggests that the patient has a female phenotype but lacks internal female reproductive organs. This is consistent with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a condition where a genetic male (XY) is resistant to male hormones (androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. The other options do not fit the patient's presentation. 5-\u03b1 reductase deficiency would present with ambiguous genitalia, which is not the case here. Sex chromosome mosaicism and monosomy would not typically present with the absence of internal female reproductive organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
