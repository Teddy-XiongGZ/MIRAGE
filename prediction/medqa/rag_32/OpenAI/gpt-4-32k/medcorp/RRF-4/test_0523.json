    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon and rectum. The symptoms described by the patient are consistent with this condition. To confirm the diagnosis, we need to look for specific findings. Involvement of the terminal ileum and noncaseating granulomas are more characteristic of Crohn's disease, another type of inflammatory bowel disease, so these options can be ruled out. Transmural inflammation is also more typical of Crohn's disease, as ulcerative colitis usually only involves the mucosa and submucosa of the bowel. Continuous mucosal damage, on the other hand, is a hallmark of ulcerative colitis, as the inflammation in this condition is continuous and starts from the rectum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
