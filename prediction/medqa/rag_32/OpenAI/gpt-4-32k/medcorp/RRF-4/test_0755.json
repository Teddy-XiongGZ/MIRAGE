    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a pregnant woman who recently traveled and is now presenting with shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain that worsens with inspiration, and decreased air movement in the right lung. These symptoms suggest a possible pulmonary embolism, a common and potentially fatal condition that can occur during pregnancy due to hypercoagulability. An ECG or chest radiography could be useful in ruling out other conditions, but they are not the most sensitive or specific tests for pulmonary embolism. A V/Q scan is typically avoided in pregnant patients due to the risk of radiation exposure to the fetus. A CT pulmonary angiogram is the most accurate test for diagnosing a pulmonary embolism and can be performed safely during pregnancy with appropriate shielding to protect the fetus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
