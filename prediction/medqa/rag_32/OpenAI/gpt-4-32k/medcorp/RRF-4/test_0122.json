    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash, along with her travel history to Brazil, are suggestive of a mosquito-borne illness. Dengue virus, Rubella virus, Toxoplasmosis, and Zika virus can all cause these symptoms. However, the finding of fetal microcephaly on ultrasound is a key clue. Microcephaly is not typically associated with Dengue virus or Toxoplasmosis. Rubella virus can cause microcephaly, but the patient's history of receiving all recommended childhood vaccinations makes this less likely, as Rubella is typically prevented by the MMR vaccine. Zika virus, on the other hand, has been specifically linked to microcephaly in infants when the mother is infected during pregnancy. Therefore, Zika virus is the most likely etiologic agent in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Zika virus\"}"
