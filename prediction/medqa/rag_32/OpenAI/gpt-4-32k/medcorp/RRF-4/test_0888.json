    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. The p-value of 0.03 indicates that there is a 3% chance that the observed association between prior cesarean birth and increased risk of placenta accreta occurred by chance, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis in this case would be that there is no association between prior cesarean birth and increased risk of placenta accreta. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the p-value in this context is that there is a 3% chance that the observed association occurred by chance, assuming there is no true association (i.e., the null hypothesis is true).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
