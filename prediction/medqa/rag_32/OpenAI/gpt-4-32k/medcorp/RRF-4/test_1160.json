These symptoms are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis, a type of arthritis that affects some people who have psoriasis. The fact that her father has a similar condition also supports this diagnosis, as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis both have a genetic component. Gout typically presents with acute, severe pain and swelling in one joint, often the big toe, which does not match this patient's symptoms. Reactive arthritis is usually triggered by an infection in another part of the body, and there is no mention of a recent infection in the patient's history. Dermatomyositis typically presents with a distinctive skin rash and muscle weakness, which are not reported in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
