    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life is suggestive of a bowel obstruction. The prenatal history of polyhydramnios (AFI of 28 cm) is also consistent with this diagnosis, as polyhydramnios can occur when there is decreased fetal swallowing due to gastrointestinal obstruction. Duodenal atresia, pyloric stenosis, and meconium ileus can all present with these findings. However, duodenal atresia and pyloric stenosis would not typically present with failure to pass meconium. Meconium ileus, on the other hand, is classically associated with this finding. Meconium ileus is often the earliest manifestation of cystic fibrosis and is caused by abnormally thick and sticky meconium that forms a concretion within the intestine, causing obstruction. Although the patient's siblings are healthy and there is no family history of cystic fibrosis, the disease can still present in this patient as it is an autosomal recessive disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
