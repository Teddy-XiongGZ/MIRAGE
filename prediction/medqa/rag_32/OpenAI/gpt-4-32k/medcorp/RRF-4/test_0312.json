    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of fatigue, back pain, hypercalcemia, and renal failure is suggestive of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells that produce a large amount of a single (monoclonal) immunoglobulin. The immunoglobulin can deposit in the kidneys, leading to renal failure. The light chains of the immunoglobulin can precipitate within the renal tubules, leading to the formation of eosinophilic casts, as seen in this patient. On peripheral blood smear, the immunoglobulins can cause the red blood cells to stick together in a linear fashion, a phenomenon known as rouleaux formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
