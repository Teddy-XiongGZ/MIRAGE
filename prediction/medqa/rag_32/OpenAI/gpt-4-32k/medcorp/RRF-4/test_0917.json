    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis are consistent with hypoglycemia, which is confirmed by a serum glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL. The patient's hypoglycemia resolves with a dextrose infusion, but he has a recurrent episode overnight. During this episode, his serum insulin concentration is significantly elevated at 108 mIU/L, while his C-peptide concentration is low at 0.3 ng/mL. Insulin and C-peptide are co-secreted in equimolar amounts from the pancreas, so in most forms of hypoglycemia due to endogenous hyperinsulinism (eg, insulinoma), both insulin and C-peptide levels are elevated. However, this patient's elevated insulin level and low C-peptide level suggest exogenous insulin administration. Given the history of the mother with type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is likely that she is administering her own insulin to the patient, causing his recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. This is consistent with a diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on another (also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy), where a caregiver induces or fabricates signs or symptoms in another person under their care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
