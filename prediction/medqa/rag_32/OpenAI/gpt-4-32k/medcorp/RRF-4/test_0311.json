    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of blood in stools and anemia, along with the finding of a polypoid mass in the ascending colon, suggest a colorectal neoplasm. The most common pathway involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer is the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, which involves the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. One of the key steps in this sequence is the mutation of the APC gene, which leads to impaired degradation of \u03b2-catenin. This results in the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of various oncogenes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
