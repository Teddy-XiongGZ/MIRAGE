    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of weakness and polyuria, along with her laboratory findings of hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), are suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. The imaging findings of subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis further support this diagnosis. Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a parathyroid adenoma, which is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland. Parathyroid carcinoma is a much less common cause. Decreased calcitriol concentration and phosphate retention are not typically associated with primary hyperparathyroidism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
