    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a chronic cough, fatigue, weight loss, and hemoptysis. These symptoms, along with the finding of a nodule with irregular borders in the lung apex on chest x-ray, are suggestive of a malignancy. The patient's history of alcohol use and lack of travel history make sarcoidosis less likely. Carcinoid tumors are typically located in the bronchi and are often associated with symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, which the patient does not have. Between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, the former is more likely to be centrally located and associated with smoking, while the latter is more common in non-smokers and can be located peripherally, as in this case. Therefore, adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
