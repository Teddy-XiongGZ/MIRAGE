    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cohort study is a type of observational study that follows a group of people (a cohort) over time. In this case, the authors followed a group of patients who underwent cerclage wiring for femur fractures. However, the editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead. A case series is a descriptive study that follows a group of patients who have a similar diagnosis or who are undergoing the same procedure over a certain period of time. The main difference between a cohort study and a case series is that a cohort study compares outcomes between two or more groups, while a case series does not have a comparison group. In this case, the authors did not compare the outcomes of the patients who underwent cerclage wiring with a control group of patients who did not undergo this procedure. Therefore, the study is more accurately described as a case series. The number of patients in the study does not determine whether it is a cohort study or a case series. Ascertainment bias and lack of risk calculation are not relevant to the distinction between a cohort study and a case series.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
