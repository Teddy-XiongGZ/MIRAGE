    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of bilateral wrist and knee pain, morning stiffness, and non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints are indicative of a chronic joint condition. Ankylosing spondylitis typically presents with lower back pain and stiffness, which the patient does not report, so this can be ruled out. Gout usually presents with acute, severe joint pain and swelling, often in the big toe, which also does not match the patient's symptoms. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue, but the patient does not report these symptoms. Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, is a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects the hands, knees, and hips. It often presents with joint pain and stiffness, and can cause bony enlargements in the distal interphalangeal joints, known as Heberden's nodes, which matches the patient's presentation. Therefore, osteoarthritis is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
