The laboratory findings of microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume of 70 um^3) with high serum iron and ferritin levels are consistent with anemia of chronic disease, also known as anemia of inflammation. This condition is common in individuals with chronic illnesses, including alcoholism. In anemia of chronic disease, iron is sequestered within storage sites and not available for erythropoiesis, leading to microcytic anemia. However, unlike iron deficiency anemia, serum iron and ferritin levels are high. The peripheral smear in anemia of chronic disease may show erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
