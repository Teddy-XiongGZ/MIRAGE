    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of large, tense, pruritic bullae and the biopsy findings of IgG antibodies and linear immunofluorescence at the epidermal basement membrane are characteristic of bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease where antibodies are directed against hemidesmosomes, which are cell junctions that connect the basal cells of the epidermis to the underlying basement membrane. Therefore, the antibodies in this patient's condition are most likely binding to hemidesmosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hemidesmosomes\"}"
