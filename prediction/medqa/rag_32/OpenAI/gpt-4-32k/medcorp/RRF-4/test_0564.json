    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is currently on citalopram for his generalized anxiety disorder and has been experiencing sexual side effects, which are common with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram. Lowering the dose of citalopram (option A) may not alleviate these side effects and could risk the return of his anxiety symptoms. Switching to another SSRI like fluoxetine (option C) is unlikely to resolve the sexual side effects, as these are common to all SSRIs. Selegiline (option D) is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and is not typically first-line treatment for anxiety due to its potential for serious side effects and dietary restrictions. Bupropion (option B) is an atypical antidepressant that does not usually cause sexual side effects and can be added to SSRI treatment to help alleviate these side effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
