    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and irregularly irregular heart rhythm suggest atrial fibrillation. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that is often used to control the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. It works by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which increases intracellular calcium and enhances vagal tone. This leads to a decrease in the conduction of electrical impulses through the atrioventricular node, slowing the ventricular rate. Therefore, the effect of digoxin in this patient is best explained by vagal stimulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
