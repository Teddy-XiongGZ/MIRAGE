    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, severe right flank pain and the ultrasound findings of a large simple cyst on the right ovary with no flow detected in the right ovarian vein are suggestive of ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary twists around its ligamentous supports, disrupting its blood supply. The ovarian ligament and the infundibulopelvic ligament (suspensory ligament) are the two main ligaments that support the ovary. The ovarian ligament extends from the uterus to the ovary. The infundibulopelvic ligament, on the other hand, extends from the lateral aspect of the uterus to the ovary and contains the ovarian vessels. In ovarian torsion, the ovary typically twists around both the infundibulopelvic ligament and the ovarian ligament, as stated in Document [2]. Therefore, the infundibulopelvic ligament is most likely to have been involved in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Infundibulopelvic ligament\"}"
