    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a boy with asthma that worsens with exposure to pollen, indicating an allergic component to his asthma. The experimental therapy being considered targets a mediator that promotes class switching of antibodies. This is a key feature of allergic reactions, where the immune system produces IgE antibodies in response to allergens. The cytokine that promotes class switching to IgE is Interleukin-4 (IL-4). Therefore, the mediator being targeted in this experimental therapy is likely IL-4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. IL-4\"}"
