    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of slurred speech and arm weakness that resolved completely are suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than one hour, and without evidence of acute infarction. The patient's risk factors including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and vascular claudication further support this diagnosis. An initial head CT scan was performed and showed no acute changes. The next best step in management would be to perform a diffusion-weighted MRI, which is the most sensitive test for detecting acute ischemic stroke, as it can detect ischemic changes within minutes of symptom onset. A CT angiogram would be useful for evaluating the patient's cerebral vasculature, but it is not the first-line imaging modality in this scenario. An echocardiogram could be useful for identifying a cardiac source of emboli, but it is not the immediate next step. Heparin is not typically used in the acute management of TIA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
