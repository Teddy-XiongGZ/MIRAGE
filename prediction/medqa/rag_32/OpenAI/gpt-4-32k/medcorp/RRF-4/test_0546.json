    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has shortness of breath 12 hours after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer. The chest x-ray shows an elevated left hemidiaphragm, which is a common postoperative finding and is most often due to atelectasis. Atelectasis in the postoperative setting is usually due to shallow breathing that results in poor clearance of bronchial secretions and subsequent airway plugging. The patient's history of smoking and recent surgery both increase his risk for atelectasis. The other options are less likely: Asthma exacerbation would likely present with wheezing, which is not mentioned in the stem. Pneumonitis would typically present with additional symptoms such as cough or fever. Pulmonary embolism could present with shortness of breath, but the patient's normal vital signs and lack of leg swelling or tenderness make this less likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
