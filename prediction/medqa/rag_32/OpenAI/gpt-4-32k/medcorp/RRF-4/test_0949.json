    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of long-term smoking, symptoms of productive cough and shortness of breath, physical examination findings of wheezes and coarse crackles, and chest x-ray findings of increased lung lucency and diaphragmatic flattening are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The initial pharmacotherapy for COPD includes a short-acting bronchodilator such as albuterol for immediate relief of symptoms. If symptoms persist, a long-acting anticholinergic such as tiotropium can be added. Systemic corticosteroids like prednisone are generally reserved for acute exacerbations. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used in the management of asthma and is not typically used in COPD. Theophylline is a bronchodilator that is rarely used due to its narrow therapeutic index and significant side effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Prednisone and albuterol\"}"
