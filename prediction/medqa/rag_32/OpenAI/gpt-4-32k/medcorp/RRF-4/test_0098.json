    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident and is complaining of significant neck pain. This could indicate a potential cervical spine injury. The first step in managing potential cervical spine injuries is to immobilize the neck to prevent further damage. This is typically done using a cervical collar. The patient's vital signs are stable and he denies any neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness or tingling in his extremities, which makes immediate administration of IV methylprednisolone or overnight observation less likely. A lateral cervical film could be useful for further evaluation, but it should be done after the neck is immobilized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cervical immobilization\"}"
