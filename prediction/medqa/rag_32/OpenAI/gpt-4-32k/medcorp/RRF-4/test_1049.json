    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B is cultivated in a culture with lysed bacteria from an infectious isolate. After this cultivation, some animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. This suggests that the noninfectious bacteria have acquired genetic material from the lysed infectious bacteria, enabling them to cause infection. This process is known as transformation, which is a form of horizontal gene transfer where bacteria take up foreign genetic material from their surroundings. Conjugation involves direct contact between two bacterial cells and transfer of genetic material, which is not described in the scenario. Reassortment is a process that occurs in viruses, not bacteria. Recombination involves exchange of genetic material between two similar or identical molecules of DNA, which is also not described in the scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
