    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug that is often used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on bronchial smooth muscle, which results in bronchodilation. The action of acetylcholine is mediated through the muscarinic receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors. When acetylcholine binds to these receptors, it activates the phosphoinositol system, leading to bronchoconstriction. Therefore, by blocking the action of acetylcholine, ipratropium bromide inhibits the phosphoinositol system, leading to bronchodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
