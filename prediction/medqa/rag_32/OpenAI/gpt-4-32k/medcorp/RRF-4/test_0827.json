    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and visual field defects suggest a pituitary adenoma, likely a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas can cause amenorrhea by inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn reduces the release of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, leading to a decrease in estrogen production and thus amenorrhea. The other options do not fit with the patient's presentation. Intrauterine scar tissue accumulation (Asherman syndrome) typically presents with amenorrhea following a history of uterine surgery, which this patient does not have. Nondisjunction of chromosomes can lead to conditions like Turner syndrome, but this patient's normal puberty and menstrual history prior to the amenorrhea do not fit with that diagnosis. Nutritional imbalance can cause amenorrhea, but is typically seen in patients with significant weight loss, eating disorders, or malnutrition, none of which are mentioned in the patient's history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
