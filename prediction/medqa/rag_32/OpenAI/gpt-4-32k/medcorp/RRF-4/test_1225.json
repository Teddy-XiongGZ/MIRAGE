    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is also low, suggesting that the anemia is microcytic. The most common cause of microcytic anemia in infants is iron deficiency, which is often due to inadequate dietary intake. The patient's total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is high, which is another indicator of iron deficiency, as the body increases TIBC when it needs more iron. The serum iron level is within the normal range, but it is on the lower end. The patient's serum lead level is normal, ruling out lead poisoning as a cause of the anemia. Given these findings, the patient likely has iron deficiency anemia due to inadequate dietary intake of iron. Therefore, the patient should be treated with both iron supplementation and a proper diet that includes iron-rich foods.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Proper diet and iron supplementation\"}"
