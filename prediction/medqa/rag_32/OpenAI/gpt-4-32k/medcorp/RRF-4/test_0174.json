    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a scenario where asymptomatic patients diagnosed with GBM through screening MRI had a longer average survival time than those diagnosed after symptom onset. This could be due to lead-time bias, which occurs when early detection of a disease (in this case through screening MRI) appears to increase survival time, not because the patient's prognosis has improved, but simply because the disease was identified earlier. This bias can give a false impression of improved survival.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lead-time bias\"}"
