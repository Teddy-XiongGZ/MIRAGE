    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can lead to serious complications in the fetus, including hydrops fetalis and fetal death, as mentioned in Document [2]. This is due to the virus causing severe anemia in the fetus. Document [4] also mentions that fetal complications occur more frequently when maternal infection occurs before 20 weeks of gestation. However, the statement that fetal loss occurs in more than 40% of primary infections is not accurate, as Document [11] mentions that vertical transmission of parvovirus B19 occurs more readily during the second trimester, and fetal loss rates of 8% to 17% have been reported. The neonate being born with a typical slapped-cheek rash is also not accurate, as this is a symptom seen in children and adults with the infection, not neonates. Aplastic crisis is a complication seen in individuals with chronic hemolytic anemia, not neonates, as mentioned in Document [21].\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
