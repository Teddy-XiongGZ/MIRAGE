    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include sudden onset of speech changes, where his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words, and weakness of the right arm. This suggests a neurological issue. Given that the brain controls the opposite side of the body, the weakness in the right arm suggests a problem in the left hemisphere of the brain. The speech issues suggest a problem in an area of the brain responsible for language, which is typically located in the left hemisphere for right-handed individuals. The left frontal lobe contains Broca's area, which is responsible for speech production. Damage to this area can result in Broca's aphasia, characterized by non-fluent, effortful speech and difficulty in forming words, but with preserved comprehension. This matches the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Left frontal lobe\"}"
