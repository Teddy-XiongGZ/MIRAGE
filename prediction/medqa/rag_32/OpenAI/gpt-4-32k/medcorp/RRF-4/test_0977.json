    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes the lesions as brown, greasy, and appearing on the forehead. Melanoma is usually a dark, irregularly shaped lesion that can appear anywhere on the body, so it's less likely. Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by dark, velvety patches in body folds and creases, which doesn't match the description. Erythema nodosum presents as painful, red, tender lumps usually located in the front of the legs below the knees, which also doesn't match. Seborrheic keratosis, however, is characterized by brown, black or light tan growths on the face, chest, shoulders or back. The growths have a waxy, scaly, slightly elevated appearance, which matches the description in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
