    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the dosage of amoxicillin that should be administered twice daily to maintain a steady state plasma concentration of 2 mg/L. The plasma clearance of the drug is given as 15.0 L/h and the oral bioavailability is 75%. The formula for calculating the maintenance dose is MD = Cp * CL / F, where MD is the maintenance dose, Cp is the target plasma concentration, CL is the clearance of the drug, and F is the bioavailability. Substituting the given values into the formula gives MD = 2 mg/L * 15.0 L/h / 0.75 = 40 mg/h. Since the drug is administered twice daily, the dosage for each dosing interval should be 40 mg/h * 12 h = 480 mg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
