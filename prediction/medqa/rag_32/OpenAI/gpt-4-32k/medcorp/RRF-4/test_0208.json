    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that DN501 has the same mechanism of action as darunavir. Therefore, I need to find the mechanism of action of darunavir. According to Document [8], darunavir is a nonpeptidic inhibitor of protease (PR) that lodges itself in the active site of PR through a number of hydrogen bonds. This suggests that darunavir inhibits viral assembly, as protease is an enzyme that HIV needs to assemble new virus particles. Therefore, DN501, having the same mechanism of action, should also inhibit viral assembly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
