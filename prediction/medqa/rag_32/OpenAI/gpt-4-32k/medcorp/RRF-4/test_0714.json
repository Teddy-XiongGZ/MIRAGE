    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of sudden, severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the back are characteristic of aortic dissection. This is further supported by his history of a heart murmur and physical features such as being tall and having joint hypermobility, which may suggest a connective tissue disorder like Marfan syndrome that predisposes to aortic dissection. In aortic dissection, the intimal layer of the aorta tears, and blood enters the media, creating a false lumen. This can lead to a variety of murmurs depending on the involvement of the aortic valve or other vessels. However, the murmur that is most commonly associated with aortic dissection is a diastolic murmur due to aortic regurgitation when the dissection involves the ascending aorta and causes distortion of the aortic valve. None of the options provided exactly match this description. However, the option that is closest and could potentially be seen in aortic dissection is a systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space, which could occur if the dissection extends to the aortic root and causes turbulent flow across the aortic valve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
