    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of syncope and exercise-induced shortness of breath suggest a cardiovascular issue. The physical examination findings of a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway, and the palpation of the carotid artery showing 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole, are characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Aortic stenosis usually presents with a systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the carotids, not the left lower sternal border. Cardiac tamponade would present with hypotension and jugular venous distention, which are not mentioned in the case. Third-degree heart block would present with bradycardia and potentially variable intensity of the first heart sound, which are also not mentioned in the case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\"}"
