    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best method to detect the genetic material of HIV in a potentially infected child. ELISA and Rapid HIV antibody tests are used to detect antibodies against HIV, not the genetic material of the virus itself. Southern blot is a method used to detect specific DNA sequences in DNA samples, but it is not typically used in clinical settings for HIV detection due to its complexity and time-consuming nature. On the other hand, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a widely used method to amplify and thus detect specific DNA sequences, including the genetic material of HIV. This makes PCR the best choice among the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
