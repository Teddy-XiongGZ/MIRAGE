    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cross-bridge cycle in muscle contraction involves several steps. First, the myosin head binds to actin, forming a cross-bridge. Then, the myosin head undergoes a power stroke, pulling the actin filament and generating force. During this power stroke, inorganic phosphate (Pi) is released. After the power stroke, ADP is released from the myosin head, and a new ATP molecule binds, causing the myosin head to detach from actin and re-cock, ready for another cycle. If a drug inhibits the release of phosphate, it would most likely block the power stroke, as this is the step associated with phosphate release.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
