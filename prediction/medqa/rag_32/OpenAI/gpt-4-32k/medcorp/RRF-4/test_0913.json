    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and chest radiograph findings are suggestive of pneumonia. The study she is participating in has identified a protein in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient\u2019s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. This process is suggestive of the immune response to an infection, which involves the production of antibodies that can bind to specific antigens on the surface of pathogens. The production of these antibodies involves a process called VDJ recombination, which allows for the generation of a diverse repertoire of antibodies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
