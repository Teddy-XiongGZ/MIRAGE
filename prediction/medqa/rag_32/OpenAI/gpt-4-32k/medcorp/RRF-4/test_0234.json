    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of a progressively growing mass in his axilla, recurrent episodes of low-grade fever, weight loss, and nontender, right axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy are suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The biopsy results showing granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei are indicative of Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient's hypercalcemia in the setting of low PTH levels suggests a PTH-independent mechanism. Among the options, the production of PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) by malignant cells is a known cause of PTH-independent hypercalcemia. PTHrP shares homology with PTH and can bind to the same receptor, leading to increased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and increased bone resorption, thereby causing hypercalcemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
