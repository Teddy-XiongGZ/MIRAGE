    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has phenylketonuria (PKU) and her phenylalanine levels are significantly elevated. PKU is a metabolic disorder that, if not properly managed, can lead to severe neurological complications. In pregnant women with PKU, high phenylalanine levels can also lead to serious complications in the fetus, including microcephaly, congenital heart defects, and developmental delays. This is known as maternal PKU syndrome. To prevent these complications, women with PKU who wish to become pregnant are advised to lower their blood phenylalanine levels before they become pregnant and maintain these levels throughout the pregnancy. This is typically achieved by adhering to a strict, low-phenylalanine diet. Therefore, the most appropriate response to this patient would be to advise her to start a phenylalanine-restricted diet at least 3 months prior to conception to lower her phenylalanine levels to a safe range.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
