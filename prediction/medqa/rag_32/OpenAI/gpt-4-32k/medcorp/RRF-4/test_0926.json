    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is concerning for a pulmonary embolism (PE), given his recent surgery, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. PE is a common complication following surgery, especially in patients with additional risk factors such as this patient's diabetes. A complete blood count and type and screen would not be immediately helpful in this situation, and there is no indication for transfusion at this time, so option A can be ruled out. While a deep wound culture and antibiotics might be indicated if there was concern for a wound infection, the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a PE than a systemic infection, so option C can be ruled out. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be elevated in many conditions including infection and malignancy, but it is not specific for PE, and oxycodone would not address the likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, so option D can be ruled out. Therefore, the best next step would be to perform a CT angiography of the chest to look for a PE, and to give the patient supplemental oxygen to help alleviate his hypoxia, as in option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
