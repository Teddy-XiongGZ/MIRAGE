    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a condition called Prinzmetal angina, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of chest pain that usually occur at rest, often at night. The pain is caused by coronary artery spasm, which is not related to exertion or physical activity. The fact that the pain resolves spontaneously and is not associated with any common preceding event also supports this diagnosis. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is not recommended for Prinzmetal angina because it can exacerbate coronary spasm. Aspirin and heparin are used for conditions involving clot formation, which is not the case here. Isosorbide dinitrate, a nitrate, is used in the treatment of Prinzmetal angina because it can help relax and widen blood vessels, preventing the spasms that cause the chest pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
