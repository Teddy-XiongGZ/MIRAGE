    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's new-onset irritability, agitation, and visual hallucinations are suggestive of delirium, a common condition in hospitalized elderly patients. Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by fluctuating mental status, inattention, and either altered level of consciousness or disorganized thinking. It is often precipitated by medications, infections, metabolic derangements, or unfamiliar environments. The first step in management is to identify and address the underlying cause. Nonpharmacologic interventions are the mainstay of treatment and include frequent reorientation, involvement of family, ensuring use of hearing aids/glasses, and maintaining a quiet and well-lit environment with visible clocks and calendars. Pharmacologic treatment is reserved for patients who are a danger to themselves or others and should be used for the shortest duration possible. Antipsychotics (eg, olanzapine, haloperidol) are the preferred agents. Benzodiazepines can worsen delirium and should be avoided unless delirium is due to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine) have strong anticholinergic properties and can also worsen delirium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
