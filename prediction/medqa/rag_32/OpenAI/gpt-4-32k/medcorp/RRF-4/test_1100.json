    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 2-day-old infant with symptoms of meningitis, including vomiting, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, nuchal rigidity, and bulging fontanelles. The fact that the cultures grew out gram-positive bacteria and the patient responded to treatment with penicillin G suggests that the causative organism is likely a gram-positive bacterium that is sensitive to penicillin. The most common causes of neonatal meningitis are Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Of these, only Group B Streptococcus and Listeria monocytogenes are gram-positive. Listeria monocytogenes is known for its characteristic tumbling motility at room temperature (22 degrees Celsius). Therefore, the most likely organism causing this patient's symptoms is Listeria monocytogenes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
