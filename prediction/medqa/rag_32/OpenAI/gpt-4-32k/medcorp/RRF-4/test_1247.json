    "The volume of gas in the airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange is known as the dead space. Dead space is composed of anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space. Anatomical dead space is the volume of the conducting airways where no gas exchange occurs, and alveolar dead space is the volume of alveoli where no gas exchange occurs due to lack of blood flow or ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In this case, the anatomical dead space is given as the sum of the upper airway volume and the conducting airway volume, which is 100 mL + 125 mL = 225 mL. The question does not provide information about alveolar dead space, so we can assume that all alveoli are well perfused and there is no alveolar dead space. Therefore, the total volume of gas in this patient's airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange, or the total dead space, is equal to the anatomical dead space, which is 225 mL. So, the answer is: None of the above. However, since we have to choose from the given options, the closest answer would be A. 480 mL.
