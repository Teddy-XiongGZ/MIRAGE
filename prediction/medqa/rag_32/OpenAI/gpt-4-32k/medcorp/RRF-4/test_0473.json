    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of painful mouth/gums, vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa, inability to eat or drink due to pain, irritability, and muscle aches, along with the physical examination findings of vesicular lesions on the tongue, gingiva, and lips, some of which have ruptured and ulcerated, and palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy, are indicative of a viral infection. CMV and HIV can cause oral lesions, but they are not typically associated with the acute presentation seen in this patient. HSV-2 is primarily associated with genital lesions. HSV-1, on the other hand, is known to cause oral lesions and can present with the symptoms seen in this patient, making it the most likely causative organism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. HSV-1\"}"
