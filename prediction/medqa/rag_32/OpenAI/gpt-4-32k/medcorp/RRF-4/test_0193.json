    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a factor secreted by Th1 cells that can stimulate phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages, activate macrophages to produce mediators such as NO, and lead to the formation of a tubercle during a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. From the documents, it is clear that IFN-gamma is a cytokine produced by Th1 cells that activates macrophages to increase their intracellular killing power and destroy bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Document 3). Document 5 also mentions that IFN-gamma activates macrophages so that they become more powerful in killing intracellular organisms and allows the macrophages to overcome the inhibition of phagolysosome maturation caused by mycobacteria. Therefore, IFN-gamma is the factor secreted by Th1 cells that is responsible for these actions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
