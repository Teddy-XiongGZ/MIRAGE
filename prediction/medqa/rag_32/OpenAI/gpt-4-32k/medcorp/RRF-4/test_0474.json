    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a situation where a patient's advance directive conflicts with the wishes of a family member. The patient's advance directive clearly states that he does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. This is a legally binding document that expresses the patient's wishes for medical treatment when they are unable to communicate them themselves. The patient's wife's emotional plea, while understandable, does not override the patient's stated wishes. The patient's adult son's opinion is not mentioned, but it would not change the legal standing of the advance directive. Consulting a judge or the hospital ethics committee would not be necessary in this case, as the patient's wishes are clearly stated in the advance directive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
