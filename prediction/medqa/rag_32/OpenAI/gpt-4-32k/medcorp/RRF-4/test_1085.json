    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria that began shortly after eating a peanut butter sandwich suggest an allergic reaction, likely anaphylaxis given the severity of her symptoms. The treatment for anaphylaxis is epinephrine. Epinephrine acts on adrenergic receptors, causing increased heart rate and contractility, bronchodilation, and vasoconstriction. In terms of its effects on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential, epinephrine would increase the influx of calcium ions during phase 4, which is the spontaneous depolarization phase that leads to the threshold potential and triggers the next action potential.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
