    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a young woman presenting with right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated, which is a positive Rovsing's sign. This sign is indicative of appendicitis. The next best step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis with imaging. An abdominal radiograph is not the best choice as it is not sensitive or specific for appendicitis. A \u00df-hCG test is used to rule out pregnancy before performing imaging with ionizing radiation or to diagnose ectopic pregnancy, but the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of ectopic pregnancy. A stool occult blood test is used to detect gastrointestinal bleeding, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms. Therefore, a CT scan, which is highly sensitive and specific for appendicitis, would be the most appropriate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
