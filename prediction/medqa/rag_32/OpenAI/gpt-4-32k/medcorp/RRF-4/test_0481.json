    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hemoglobin A1c test measures the average blood sugar level over the past 2 to 3 months. It's used to diagnose type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. It's also used to monitor people already diagnosed with diabetes and to see how well they're managing their condition. If the cut-off for diagnosing diabetes is increased from 6.5% to 7.0%, fewer people would be diagnosed with diabetes. This means that some people who actually have diabetes would not be diagnosed, leading to an increase in false negative results. False negatives occur when a test result indicates that a person does not have a condition when they actually do.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
