    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of morning stiffness, back pain, and joint pain that improves with movement are suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis. The involvement of the spine and peripheral joints, along with a family history of joint issues, raises suspicion for a seronegative spondyloarthropathy such as ankylosing spondylitis. The warmth and swelling of the wrist and PIP joints suggest active synovitis. Given these findings, the next best step would be to evaluate for systemic inflammation and autoantibodies associated with inflammatory arthritis. Serum calcium and PTH would be more relevant in a patient with symptoms suggestive of hyperparathyroidism, which this patient does not have. Calcium and Vitamin D prescription would be more appropriate for a patient with osteoporosis or osteopenia, but this patient's symptoms are more suggestive of inflammatory arthritis. Serum ferritin would be more relevant in a patient with symptoms suggestive of hemochromatosis or as a marker of inflammation, but it would not be the first test to order in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
