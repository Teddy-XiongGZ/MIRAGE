    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, specifically uterine prolapse. This is supported by her history of multiple vaginal deliveries, which is a risk factor for pelvic organ prolapse, and her physical examination findings of cervical descent. The treatment options for pelvic organ prolapse include conservative management, pessary use, and surgery. Given that the patient is symptomatic but does not have severe prolapse (the cervix descends to the plane of the hymen but not beyond), a pessary would be a reasonable first-line treatment. A support pessary is typically used for uterine prolapse, while a space-filling pessary is more commonly used for a cystocele or rectocele. Posterior colporrhaphy is a surgical treatment for rectocele, not uterine prolapse. Sacral colpopexy is a surgical treatment for uterine or vaginal vault prolapse, but is typically reserved for severe cases or those that fail conservative management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
