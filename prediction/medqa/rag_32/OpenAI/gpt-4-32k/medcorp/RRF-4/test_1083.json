    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of recent increased physical activity, localized pain, and radiographic findings are suggestive of a stress fracture. Stress fractures are common overuse injuries that occur when repetitive submaximal forces lead to bone resorption that exceeds the rate of bone formation. They are common in military recruits, runners, and dancers. Pain is initially present only during or after activity but may progress to pain at rest as the condition worsens. On examination, there is often point tenderness at the fracture site. Radiographs may be normal early in the disease course but later show periosteal reaction and callus formation. Management includes rest and analgesics. The patient should be advised to limit weight bearing on the affected extremity and to gradually return to physical activity once the pain has resolved. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is rest and acetaminophen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
