    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old girl who has not had a menstrual period. She has secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development but has sparse pubic hair. The presence of bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses and a blind-ended vaginal pouch, along with the absence of a uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography, suggest a disorder of sexual development. Given her 46,XY karyotype, this is likely a form of Swyer syndrome or complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). In both conditions, individuals are phenotypically female but genetically male (46,XY). In Swyer syndrome, individuals have nonfunctional gonadal streaks instead of ovaries, which can increase the risk of gonadoblastoma. In CAIS, individuals have testes that are usually located in the inguinal canal, which can also increase the risk of gonadal tumors. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is gonadectomy to prevent the development of gonadal tumors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
