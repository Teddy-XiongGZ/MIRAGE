    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of constipation and fatigue could be side effects of his medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The options provided are all targets of different classes of antihypertensive drugs. Angiotensin-II receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme are targets of angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors, respectively. These drugs are not typically associated with constipation. The Na+/Cl- cotransporter and Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters are targets of thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics, respectively. Thiazide diuretics can cause electrolyte imbalances, which could potentially lead to constipation. Therefore, the Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule is the most likely target of the medication causing the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
