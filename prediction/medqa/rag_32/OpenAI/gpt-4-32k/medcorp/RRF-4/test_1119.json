    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's pain is localized to the anteromedial proximal tibia, which is the site of the pes anserine bursa. The pes anserine bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac located on the inner side of the knee, about 2-3 inches below the joint. It reduces friction between the tendons and the tibia. Inflammation of this bursa leads to pes anserine bursitis, which is often seen in overweight middle-aged women and is associated with activities that involve repeatedly climbing stairs or rising from a chair. The patient's negative valgus stress test makes an MCL sprain unlikely. A medial meniscus tear would typically present with joint effusion and a positive McMurray test, which the patient does not have. A stress fracture of the proximal tibia would typically present with a history of increased physical activity or trauma, and radiographic evidence of a fracture, neither of which are present in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
