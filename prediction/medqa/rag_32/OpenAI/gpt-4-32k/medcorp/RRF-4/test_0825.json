    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a young female with a round, mobile, and tender mass in her breast that seems to fluctuate with her menstrual cycle. This is suggestive of a fibroadenoma or possibly a cyst, both of which are benign conditions. Fibroadenomas can decrease in size or disappear over time, especially after menopause. However, the patient is only 16 years old, so menopause is not a factor in this case. Oral contraceptives can sometimes help with the symptoms of fibrocystic breast changes, but there's no guarantee that they will decrease the size of a fibroadenoma. This condition does not increase the patient's risk of breast cancer in the future. Rapid growth of the mass to greater than 5 cm would be unusual for a fibroadenoma and might suggest a different diagnosis, but even then, radiation and chemotherapy would not typically be the first-line treatments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
