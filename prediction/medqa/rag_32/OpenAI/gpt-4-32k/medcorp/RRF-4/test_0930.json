    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a known alcoholic who was admitted to the hospital after a fall. He was started on IV fluids and his condition suddenly worsened, with symptoms including difficulty moving his arms and legs, chewing, swallowing, moving his face, and speaking. These symptoms suggest a neurological issue. The question asks about an electrolyte imbalance that was corrected too aggressively. In the context of alcoholism, hyponatremia is a common electrolyte imbalance.

This condition can cause severe neurological symptoms, including difficulty moving and speaking, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
