    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of tachycardia, hypotension, dilated pupils, dry skin, and urinary retention is suggestive of an anticholinergic toxidrome, which is consistent with nortriptyline overdose. Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant, which can cause anticholinergic effects and cardiotoxicity, manifesting as tachycardia and QRS complex widening on ECG. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case would be sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate is used in tricyclic antidepressant overdose to combat the cardiotoxic effects by alkalinizing the serum, which helps to stabilize the myocardial sodium channels and decrease drug binding. Naloxone is used for opioid overdose, cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome, and ammonium chloride for metabolic alkalosis, none of which are indicated in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sodium bicarbonate\"}"
