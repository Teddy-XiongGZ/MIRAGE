    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has ingested multiple medications, each of which can cause different symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Aspirin overdose can cause a primary respiratory alkalosis due to direct stimulation of the respiratory centers in the medulla. However, it can also cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis due to accumulation of organic acids (eg, lactic, ketoacids). Metoprolol, a \u03b2-blocker, can cause bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm. Acetaminophen in toxic doses can cause fulminant hepatic failure. Levothyroxine overdose can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism (eg, tachycardia, hyperthermia). Finally, lorazepam can cause CNS depression. Given the child's presentation with vomiting and altered mental status, aspirin and lorazepam are the most likely culprits. Aspirin toxicity would be expected to cause a primary respiratory alkalosis and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The expected arterial blood gas for aspirin toxicity would therefore show low PCO2 and low HCO3-, which is seen in choice C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
