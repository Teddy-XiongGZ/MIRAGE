    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of itchy, watery eyes and sneezing, which occur seasonally, are suggestive of allergic conjunctivitis. This condition is an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to environmental allergens such as pollen, dust mites, or animal dander. Symptoms include itching, tearing, conjunctival injection, and clear discharge, all of which are present in this patient. Erythromycin ointment (choice A) is an antibiotic and would be appropriate for bacterial conjunctivitis, which this patient does not have. Warm compresses (choice C) can help with the symptoms of viral conjunctivitis or a stye, but would not address the underlying allergic reaction in this patient. Fluorometholone eye drops (choice D) are a type of corticosteroid and could help reduce inflammation, but are not first-line treatment for allergic conjunctivitis due to the risk of side effects. Ketotifen eye drops (choice B) are a type of antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer, and are a first-line treatment for allergic conjunctivitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
