    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of amenorrhea, irregular menstrual cycles, and a high BMI suggest a hormonal imbalance. Her mother's history of PCOS and her father's diabetes also point towards a hormonal issue. The patient's hormone levels are mostly normal, except for a low progesterone level, which indicates a lack of ovulation. The patient's use of risperidone, a medication known to cause menstrual irregularities, could also be contributing to her symptoms. However, the negative pregnancy test and normal physical examination rule out pregnancy and physical abnormalities such as uterine fibroids or Mullerian duct defects. The patient's concern about her weight could suggest an eating disorder, but there is no direct evidence of purging behavior. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms is anovulation, possibly due to PCOS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
