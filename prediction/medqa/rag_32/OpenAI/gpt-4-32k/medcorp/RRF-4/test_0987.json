    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of developmental delay, fair complexion, and musty odor suggests a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or its cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. This deficiency leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine, which can be toxic to the central nervous system and cause intellectual disability. The disease can be detected by newborn screening tests, which are routinely performed in many countries, including the United States. If PKU is detected early, affected infants can be treated with a phenylalanine-restricted diet to prevent the neurologic symptoms of the disease. Therefore, the answer is dietary restriction of phenylalanine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
