    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of ringing in the ear and sensorineural hearing loss suggest ototoxicity, a known side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. The documents mention cisplatin and carboplatin as chemotherapy drugs that can cause ototoxicity. According to Document [18], carboplatin can be used in patients with hearing impairment, suggesting that it's less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. Cisplatin, on the other hand, is mentioned in several documents (e.g., Document [31], Document [27]) as causing ototoxicity. The mechanism of action of cisplatin, as per Document [18], involves the generation of free radicals, which leads to DNA cross-linking and cell death.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Generation of free radicals\"}"
