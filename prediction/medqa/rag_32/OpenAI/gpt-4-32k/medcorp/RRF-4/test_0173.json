    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metyrapone is a drug used in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. It works by inhibiting the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase, which is involved in the final step of cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands. This inhibition leads to a decrease in cortisol production. In response to low cortisol levels, the pituitary gland increases the production of ACTH to stimulate the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol. Therefore, after the administration of metyrapone, an increase in serum ACTH would be expected. The other options do not align with the expected physiological response to metyrapone administration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
