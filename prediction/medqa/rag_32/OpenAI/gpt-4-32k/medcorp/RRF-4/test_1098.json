    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina, an enlarged uterus, and the absence of fetal parts on ultrasound are indicative of a molar pregnancy. Molar pregnancies are characterized by abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue in the uterus and can be complete or partial. In a complete molar pregnancy, the ovum is fertilized by a single sperm that duplicates its own chromosomes, resulting in a 46XX genotype. In a partial molar pregnancy, the ovum is fertilized by two sperms, resulting in a triploid genotype, typically 69XXY. Given the absence of fetal parts on ultrasound, this suggests a complete molar pregnancy, which would have a 46XX genotype.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 46XX\"}"
