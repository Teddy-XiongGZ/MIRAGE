    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rigidity observed in the body of the deceased is a post-mortem change known as rigor mortis. Rigor mortis is a natural process that occurs in the body after death, where the muscles of the body become stiff. This happens due to the cessation of cellular respiration, which leads to a depletion of ATP in the muscle cells. ATP is required for the relaxation of muscle fibers after contraction. In the absence of ATP, the actin and myosin filaments within the muscle fibers remain locked in a contracted state, leading to muscle stiffness or rigor mortis. Therefore, the process responsible for the rigidity observed is the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling, which is the process that allows for muscle relaxation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling\"}"
