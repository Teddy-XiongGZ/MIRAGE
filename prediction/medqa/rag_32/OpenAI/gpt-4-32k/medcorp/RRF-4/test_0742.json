    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cardiac complications that the infant of a mother with type 1 diabetes mellitus is at high risk for. Document [19] mentions that once pregnancy is established, glucose control should be managed more aggressively than in the nonpregnant state. This is because poor glucose control can lead to complications in the fetus. Document [24] discusses a case of a woman with type 2 diabetes who had poor glucose control during her pregnancy. Her baby developed macrosomia, which is a condition where the baby is significantly larger than average. This can lead to a number of complications, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the answer is likely to be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the question asks for a specific type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition that can occur in infants and usually resolves on its own. This seems to be the most likely answer as it aligns with the information from the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
