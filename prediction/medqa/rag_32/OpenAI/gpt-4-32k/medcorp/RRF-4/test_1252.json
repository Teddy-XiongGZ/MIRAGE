    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's elevated liver function tests, or transaminitis, could be due to one of his current medications. Metformin is primarily excreted by the kidneys and does not typically cause liver damage. Glyburide is metabolized by the liver, but it is not commonly associated with liver damage. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension, is also not typically associated with liver damage. However, simvastatin, a statin used for managing high cholesterol, is known to potentially cause liver damage or elevated liver enzymes. Therefore, simvastatin could be contributing to the patient's transaminitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
