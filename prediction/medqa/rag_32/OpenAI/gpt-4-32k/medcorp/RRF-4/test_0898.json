People with this disorder are not asocial or indifferent to relationships, but rather, they desire companionship but are hindered by their intense fear of rejection. This is different from schizoid personality disorder, where individuals genuinely prefer to be alone and do not desire or enjoy close relationships. Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a disregard for and violation of the rights of others, which is not seen in this patient. Agoraphobia involves fear of situations where escape might be difficult, such as being in open or enclosed places or being in a crowd, which is also not seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
