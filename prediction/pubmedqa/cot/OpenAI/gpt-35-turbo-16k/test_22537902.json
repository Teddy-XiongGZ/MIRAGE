    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether global management at the same center improves results for colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases, we need to consider the potential benefits of centralized care. Centralized care can lead to better coordination among different specialists involved in the treatment, more efficient communication, and standardized treatment protocols. This can result in improved outcomes and reduced complications. On the other hand, there may be potential drawbacks such as longer travel distances for patients and limited access to specialized care in remote areas. To make a definitive conclusion, we need to consider the available evidence and research studies on this topic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
