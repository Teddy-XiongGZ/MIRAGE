    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Arch form refers to the shape and alignment of the dental arches. Sagittal molar relationship refers to the relationship between the upper and lower molars in the front-to-back direction. Bolton tooth-size discrepancy refers to the difference in size between the upper and lower teeth. To determine if arch form is influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy, we need to consider the relationship between these factors. If the sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy affects the alignment or shape of the dental arches, then arch form would be influenced by these factors. If there is no direct relationship between these factors and arch form, then arch form would not be influenced by them. Based on this reasoning, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
