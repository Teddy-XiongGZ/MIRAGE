    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if oral endotracheal intubation efficacy is impaired in the helicopter environment, we need to consider the factors that could potentially affect the procedure. Some factors to consider include the vibrations and noise in the helicopter, limited space and mobility, and potential difficulties in maintaining proper positioning and visualization. Additionally, the time constraints and urgency of the situation in a helicopter may also impact the efficacy of the procedure. Based on these considerations, it is likely that oral endotracheal intubation efficacy is impaired in the helicopter environment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
