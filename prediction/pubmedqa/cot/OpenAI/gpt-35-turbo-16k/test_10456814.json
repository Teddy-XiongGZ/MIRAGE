    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether desflurane alters left ventricular function during aortic surgery, we need to review the available evidence. This can be done by conducting a literature search and reviewing relevant studies. The studies should ideally be randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews/meta-analyses that specifically investigate the effects of desflurane on left ventricular function during aortic surgery. By analyzing the findings of these studies, we can come to a conclusion regarding the impact of desflurane on left ventricular function during aortic surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
