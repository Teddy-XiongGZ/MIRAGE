    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Evaluate the mechanism of injury. If the blunt trauma is significant, such as a high-speed motor vehicle accident or a fall from a significant height, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is usually necessary to rule out internal injuries.\\nStep 2: Consider the patient's level of intoxication. If the patient is severely intoxicated and unable to provide reliable information about their symptoms or if they have a decreased level of consciousness, CT of the abdomen may be necessary to assess for internal injuries that may not be apparent on physical examination.\\nStep 3: Assess the patient's clinical presentation. If the patient has signs or symptoms of abdominal injury, such as abdominal pain, tenderness, or distension, CT of the abdomen is usually necessary to evaluate for internal injuries.\\nBased on these steps, the answer is B. no. CT of the abdomen is not always necessary in intoxicated patients with blunt trauma, but it should be considered based on the mechanism of injury, level of intoxication, and clinical presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
