    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy is different for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive techniques, we need to consider the available evidence. We can start by reviewing studies that have investigated this topic. We should look for studies that compare the rates of prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy between fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived through assisted reproductive techniques and those conceived naturally. By examining the results of these studies, we can determine if there is a difference in the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy for these two groups. Once we have reviewed the evidence, we can provide a definitive answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
