    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder patients runs true over time, we need to consider the nature of bipolar disorder and the stability of symptoms. Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of mania and depression. Manic episodes involve elevated mood, increased energy, and impulsive behavior, while mixed episodes involve symptoms of both mania and depression. If the manic/mixed episode distinction is consistent over time, we would expect individuals with bipolar disorder to consistently experience either manic or mixed episodes throughout their lifetime. On the other hand, if the distinction does not hold true over time, individuals may experience a mix of manic and mixed episodes at different points in their illness. To determine the answer, we need to consider research studies and clinical observations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
