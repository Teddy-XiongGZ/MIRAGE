    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if urinary biomarkers assessment is a non-invasive approach to tubular lesions of the solitary kidney, we need to consider the nature of urinary biomarkers and the invasiveness of the assessment. Urinary biomarkers are substances that can be detected in the urine and provide information about the health or disease status of the kidneys. Tubular lesions of the solitary kidney refer to abnormalities or damage to the tubules, which are structures in the kidney responsible for filtering and reabsorbing substances. If urinary biomarkers can accurately reflect the presence or severity of tubular lesions without the need for invasive procedures such as kidney biopsy, then urinary biomarkers assessment can be considered a non-invasive approach. However, if urinary biomarkers assessment requires invasive procedures or does not provide accurate information about tubular lesions, then it would not be considered non-invasive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
