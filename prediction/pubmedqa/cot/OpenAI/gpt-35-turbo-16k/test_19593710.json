    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is a safety feature in vehicles that helps to prevent skidding and loss of control. It works by automatically applying brakes to individual wheels and reducing engine power when it detects that the vehicle is not responding to the driver's steering inputs. This can help to improve vehicle stability and control, especially in emergency situations or when driving on slippery surfaces. Therefore, ESC has the potential to change the way we drive by enhancing safety and reducing the risk of accidents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
