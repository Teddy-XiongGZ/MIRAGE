    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antenatal corticosteroids are given to pregnant women at risk of preterm birth to help accelerate fetal lung maturation and reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. The optimal timing for administration is between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation. After the administration of antenatal corticosteroids, the effect typically lasts for about 7 days. If a woman goes into labor within this timeframe, the corticosteroids would have had enough time to exert their beneficial effects on the fetal lungs. However, if labor is delayed beyond this timeframe, the corticosteroids may have worn off and may not provide the same level of benefit. Therefore, continuing the pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration may not offer the same rescue opportunity as when labor occurs within the optimal timeframe. Based on this reasoning, the answer would be B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
