    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis, the decision to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube depends on several factors. First, the severity of the cholangitis should be considered. If the cholangitis is severe and there is a high risk of post-procedure complications, it may be necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube to ensure adequate drainage of the bile duct. Second, the presence of any residual stones or strictures in the bile duct should be assessed. If there are concerns about incomplete clearance or the development of post-procedure complications, a nasobiliary drainage tube may be necessary. Finally, the overall clinical condition of the patient should be taken into account. If the patient is stable and there are no immediate concerns, it may not be necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely. Based on these considerations, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
