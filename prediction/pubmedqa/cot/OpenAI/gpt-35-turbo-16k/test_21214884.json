    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of viruses that can infect the skin and mucous membranes. Step 2: 'High-risk' HPVs are known to cause cervical cancer and other types of cancer. Step 3: Breast milk is produced by the mammary glands and is primarily composed of nutrients and antibodies. Step 4: To determine if 'high-risk' HPVs can be detected in human breast milk, we need to consider if the virus can infect the mammary glands and if it can be transmitted to breast milk. Step 5: Studies have shown that 'high-risk' HPVs can infect the mammary glands, but the presence of the virus in breast milk is still a topic of debate. Step 6: Some studies have reported the detection of 'high-risk' HPVs in breast milk samples, while others have not. Step 7: Overall, the evidence is inconclusive and more research is needed to determine if 'high-risk' HPVs can be consistently detected in human breast milk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
