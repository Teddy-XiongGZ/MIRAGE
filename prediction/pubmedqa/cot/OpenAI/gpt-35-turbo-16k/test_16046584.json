    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is a treatment option for menopausal symptoms. Irregular endometrial bleeding can occur as a side effect of MHT. Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells are a type of immune cell found in the uterus. They play a role in regulating the menstrual cycle and implantation of the embryo. Given this information, it is possible that uNK cells could be involved in the development of irregular endometrial bleeding during MHT. However, further research is needed to determine the exact role of uNK cells in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
