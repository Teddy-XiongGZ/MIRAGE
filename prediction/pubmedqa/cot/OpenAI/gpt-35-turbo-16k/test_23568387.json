    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty, we need to consider the differences between the two procedures. Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty involves replacing only two compartments of the knee joint, while total knee arthroplasty involves replacing all three compartments. One potential advantage of bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is that it preserves more of the patient's natural knee anatomy, which may result in better muscle strength and physical performance. However, total knee arthroplasty provides more comprehensive joint replacement and may be more effective in relieving pain and improving function. To determine the answer to the question, we need to consider the available evidence from clinical studies comparing the two procedures. This evidence should include measures of knee muscle strength and physical performance in patients who have undergone each procedure. Based on the current evidence, the answer to the question is: \", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
