    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MR arthrography of the shoulder is a diagnostic imaging technique used to evaluate the structures within the shoulder joint. It involves injecting a contrast agent into the joint to enhance visualization. Local anesthesia may be used to numb the area and reduce discomfort during the injection. However, the need for local anesthesia depends on the patient's pain tolerance and the preference of the radiologist performing the procedure. Some patients may be able to tolerate the injection without anesthesia, while others may require it. Therefore, the answer to whether local anesthesia is needed for MR arthrography of the shoulder is subjective and may vary from case to case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
