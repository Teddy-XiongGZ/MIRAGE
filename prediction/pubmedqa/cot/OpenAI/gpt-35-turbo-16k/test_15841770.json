    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In order to determine if inhaled steroids differ from cromones in terms of hospital admission rates for asthma in children, we need to compare the effectiveness of these two medications in preventing hospital admissions. First, we need to understand that inhaled steroids are a type of medication that reduce inflammation in the airways, while cromones are another type of medication that stabilize mast cells and prevent the release of inflammatory substances. Both medications are commonly used in the treatment of asthma. To answer the question, we can review the available evidence from clinical studies comparing the two medications in terms of hospital admission rates for asthma in children. Based on this evidence, we can then determine if there is a difference between the two medications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
