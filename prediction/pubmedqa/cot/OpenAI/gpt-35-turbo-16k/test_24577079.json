    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether strategy training reduces age-related deficits in working memory, we need to consider the available evidence. First, we need to understand what strategy training is and how it relates to working memory. Strategy training involves teaching individuals specific techniques or strategies to improve their cognitive abilities, such as memory. Working memory refers to the ability to hold and manipulate information in the mind over short periods of time. Next, we need to review the research studies that have investigated the effects of strategy training on age-related deficits in working memory. These studies typically compare a group of older adults who receive strategy training with a control group of older adults who do not receive any training. The participants' working memory abilities are then assessed before and after the training period. Based on the available evidence, the answer to the question is: C. maybe. Some studies have shown that strategy training can lead to improvements in working memory performance in older adults, suggesting that it may help reduce age-related deficits. However, other studies have found mixed results or no significant effects of strategy training on working memory in older adults. Therefore, while there is some evidence to suggest that strategy training may be beneficial, it is not conclusive and more research is needed to fully understand its effects on age-related deficits in working memory.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
