    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CT imaging can provide valuable information about the presence and extent of hydrocephalus, which is the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. However, it may not be able to directly predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus. CT scans can show the dilatation of the ventricles and the presence of any obstructive lesions, such as tumors or cysts, which can cause CSF block. However, the specific level of blockage may require further evaluation, such as through the use of other imaging modalities or invasive procedures like lumbar puncture or intracranial pressure monitoring. Therefore, the answer to the question is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
