    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In neonatal testicular torsion, the blood supply to the testicle is compromised, leading to ischemia and potential loss of the testicle. The treatment for testicular torsion is immediate surgical exploration and detorsion of the affected testicle. However, the contralateral testicle may also be affected, either due to a concurrent torsion or due to compromised blood flow from the torsion on the affected side. In such cases, it is recommended to perform a contralateral exploration to assess the viability of the testicle. If the contralateral testicle is found to be torsed or ischemic, it should be detorsed or orchiopexy should be performed to prevent further damage. Therefore, the treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion is not 'less is more', but rather a thorough evaluation and appropriate intervention is necessary. Hence, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
