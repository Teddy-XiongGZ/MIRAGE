    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Esophageal varices are dilated veins in the esophagus that can occur in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Step 2: Non-invasive diagnosis refers to a diagnostic method that does not require invasive procedures such as endoscopy. Step 3: Duplex Doppler ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses sound waves to visualize blood flow. Step 4: In patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis, the liver is still functioning relatively well. Step 5: Given that duplex Doppler ultrasonography can visualize blood flow and detect abnormalities, it is possible that it can be used for non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis. Step 6: Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
