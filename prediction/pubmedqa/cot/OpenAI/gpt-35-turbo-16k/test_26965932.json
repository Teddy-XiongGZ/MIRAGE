    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether bare-metal stent implantation is still justifiable in high bleeding risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, we need to consider the benefits and risks of using bare-metal stents in this patient population. 1. First, we need to understand the rationale for using bare-metal stents. Bare-metal stents are metal scaffolds that are used to keep the coronary artery open after angioplasty. They do not release any medication and are associated with a lower risk of stent thrombosis compared to drug-eluting stents. 2. Next, we need to consider the bleeding risk in high bleeding risk patients. High bleeding risk patients are those who have a higher likelihood of bleeding complications due to factors such as older age, history of bleeding, or use of anticoagulant medications. 3. We also need to consider the alternative option of using drug-eluting stents. Drug-eluting stents release medication that helps prevent restenosis, but they are associated with a higher risk of stent thrombosis compared to bare-metal stents. 4. Finally, we need to weigh the benefits and risks of using bare-metal stents in high bleeding risk patients. If the bleeding risk outweighs the potential benefits of using bare-metal stents, then it may not be justifiable to use them in this patient population. Based on these considerations, the answer to the question is: C. maybe. It depends on the individual patient's bleeding risk and the potential benefits and risks of using bare-metal stents in their specific case.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
