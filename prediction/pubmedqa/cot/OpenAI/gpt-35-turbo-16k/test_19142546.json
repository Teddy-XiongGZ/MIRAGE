    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion changes after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis, we need to consider the effects of the surgery on the heart. Fibrous tissue resection involves removing the fibrous tissue that has accumulated in the endomyocardium. This procedure aims to improve the function of the heart by restoring normal myocardial motion. Therefore, it is likely that quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion will change after fibrous tissue resection. The removal of fibrous tissue should allow for improved contraction and movement of the left ventricular walls. Based on this reasoning, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
