To determine if the lifetime prevalence of impetigo, molluscum, and herpes infection is increased in children with atopic dermatitis, we need to review the available evidence. Several studies have investigated this association. We should look for systematic reviews or meta-analyses that have compiled the results of multiple studies to provide a more reliable answer. Once we have reviewed the evidence, we can determine if the lifetime prevalence of these infections is increased in children with atopic dermatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
