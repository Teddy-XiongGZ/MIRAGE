    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether topical ropivacaine reduces post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients, we need to review the available evidence. We can start by conducting a literature search to identify relevant studies. Once we have identified the studies, we can assess their quality and examine the results. If there are multiple high-quality studies that consistently show a reduction in post-tonsillectomy morbidity with the use of topical ropivacaine, then the answer would be 'yes'. If the studies do not show a clear benefit or if there is conflicting evidence, the answer would be 'maybe'. If the studies consistently show no reduction in post-tonsillectomy morbidity with the use of topical ropivacaine, then the answer would be 'no'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
