    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider several factors. First, we need to understand what the 'test and treat' policy of the World Health Organization (WHO) entails. This policy recommends that all individuals who test positive for HIV should be immediately initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART), regardless of their CD4 count or clinical stage. Next, we need to consider the current healthcare infrastructure and resources available in sub-Saharan Africa. This region has a high burden of HIV/AIDS and may already be facing challenges in providing adequate healthcare services. Additionally, we need to assess the capacity of healthcare systems in sub-Saharan Africa to handle the potential increase in demand for ART and manage the adverse effects associated with it. Finally, we need to consider any ongoing efforts or initiatives in place to strengthen healthcare systems in the region. Based on these considerations, we can determine whether sub-Saharan Africa can cope with the new 'test and treat' policy of the WHO.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
