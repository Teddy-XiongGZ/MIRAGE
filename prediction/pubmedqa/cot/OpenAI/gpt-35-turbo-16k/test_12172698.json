    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism is a common symptom that occurs when an individual abruptly stops or reduces their alcohol consumption. Beta-endorphins are natural opioids produced by the body that play a role in regulating mood and reducing anxiety. During chronic alcohol use, the body's production of beta-endorphins may be suppressed. When alcohol consumption is suddenly stopped, there is a decrease in the levels of beta-endorphins, which can contribute to the development of anxiety. Therefore, based on this understanding, it is likely that withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism is based on beta-endorphin deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
