    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, some U.S. states have higher/lower injury mortality rates than others. To determine this, we can analyze injury mortality data for different states and compare the rates. We can look at factors such as the number of deaths due to injuries, the population size of each state, and calculate the injury mortality rate per 100,000 population. By comparing these rates across states, we can identify which states have higher or lower injury mortality rates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
