    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In cases of renal cell carcinoma, a pelvic CT scan is not typically necessary. Renal cell carcinoma primarily affects the kidneys, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is usually sufficient to evaluate the extent of the disease. The primary goal of imaging in renal cell carcinoma is to assess the size, location, and spread of the tumor within the kidney and to evaluate for any metastasis. A pelvic CT scan may be considered if there are specific indications such as suspected metastasis to the pelvic region or if there are symptoms or findings that suggest involvement of the pelvic organs. However, in the absence of these indications, a pelvic CT scan is not routinely performed in cases of renal cell carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
