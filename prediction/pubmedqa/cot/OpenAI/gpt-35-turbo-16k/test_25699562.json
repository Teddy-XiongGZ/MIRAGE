    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the Transmissible Liability Index (TLI) assessed in late childhood predicts suicidal symptoms at young adulthood, we need to review relevant research studies. First, we need to search for studies that have investigated the relationship between TLI assessed in late childhood and suicidal symptoms at young adulthood. We should look for studies that have followed participants from late childhood to young adulthood and have assessed both TLI and suicidal symptoms. Once we have identified relevant studies, we can examine their findings to determine if there is a consistent pattern of TLI predicting suicidal symptoms. Based on this information, we can then choose the most appropriate answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
