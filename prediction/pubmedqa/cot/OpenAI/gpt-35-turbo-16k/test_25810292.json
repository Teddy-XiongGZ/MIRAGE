    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery, we need to consider the available evidence and research studies. We should look for studies that have investigated the outcomes and success rates of this procedure in multiple centers and with a large number of patients. Additionally, we should consider the expertise and experience of the surgeons performing the procedure, as this can impact reproducibility and applicability. Finally, we should also consider any potential limitations or complications associated with the procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
