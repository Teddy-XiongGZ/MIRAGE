    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether nurses are better than a simple objective score in predicting admission at triage, we need to consider the following factors: 1. The accuracy of nurses in predicting admission at triage: We need to assess whether nurses have a higher accuracy rate compared to a simple objective score in correctly identifying patients who require admission. 2. The reliability of a simple objective score: We need to evaluate the reliability and validity of the simple objective score in predicting admission at triage. If the score has been proven to be accurate and consistent in previous studies, it may be a reliable tool. 3. Comparative analysis: We need to compare the accuracy and reliability of nurses' predictions with the simple objective score. This can be done by conducting a study where both methods are used simultaneously and the outcomes are compared. Based on these considerations, we can determine whether nurses are better than a simple objective score in predicting admission at triage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
