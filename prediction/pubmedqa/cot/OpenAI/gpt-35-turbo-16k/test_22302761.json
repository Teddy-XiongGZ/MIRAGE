    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model, we need to consider the following steps:\\n\\n1. Review existing literature: We should first review any existing studies or research articles that have investigated the use of fractional lasers for enhancing transdermal absorption of lidocaine in animal models. This will help us understand if there is any evidence supporting the use of fractional lasers for this purpose.\\n\\n2. Consider the mechanism of action: Fractional lasers work by creating microscopic channels in the skin, which can potentially enhance the absorption of topical medications. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic commonly used for pain relief. It is possible that the use of fractional lasers could enhance the transdermal absorption of lidocaine.\\n\\n3. Evaluate animal model studies: If there are animal model studies available, we should evaluate their findings. Animal models can provide valuable insights into the effects of fractional lasers on transdermal absorption of lidocaine.\\n\\nBased on these steps, the answer choice is: A. yes\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
