    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what audit is and how it is used to identify maternal mortality in different settings. Audit is a systematic review of medical records and other relevant data to assess the quality of care provided and identify areas for improvement. It involves reviewing cases of maternal deaths and analyzing the factors contributing to these deaths. The question asks whether the use of audit to identify maternal mortality is just a difference between the rich and the poor. To answer this, we need to consider whether the use of audit is influenced by socioeconomic factors such as wealth. In many low-income settings, there may be limited resources and infrastructure for conducting audits. This could result in underreporting or inadequate identification of maternal deaths. On the other hand, in high-income settings, there may be better resources and infrastructure for conducting audits, leading to more accurate identification of maternal deaths. Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is: C. maybe. The use of audit to identify maternal mortality may be influenced by socioeconomic factors, but it is not solely determined by the difference between the rich and the poor. Other factors such as healthcare systems, data collection methods, and cultural practices may also play a role.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
