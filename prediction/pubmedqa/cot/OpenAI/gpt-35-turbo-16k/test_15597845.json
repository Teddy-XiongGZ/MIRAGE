    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol is able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutics in the treatment of human ovarian cancer, we need to consider the available evidence. First, we need to review studies or clinical trials that have investigated the use of 2-methoxyestradiol in combination with chemotherapeutics for ovarian cancer. We should look for evidence of reduced dosages of chemotherapeutics when used in combination with 2-methoxyestradiol. If there are studies or trials that demonstrate a reduction in dosages without compromising the efficacy of the treatment, then the answer would be yes. If there is no evidence or conflicting evidence, the answer would be no. If there is limited or inconclusive evidence, the answer would be maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
