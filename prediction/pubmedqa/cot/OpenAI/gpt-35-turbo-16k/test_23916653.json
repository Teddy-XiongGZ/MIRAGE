    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Orthostatic myoclonus refers to a condition characterized by involuntary muscle contractions or jerks that occur when a person assumes an upright position. These myoclonic jerks can lead to unsteadiness and difficulty maintaining balance. To determine if orthostatic myoclonus is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness, we need to consider the available evidence and research on this condition. We should look for studies or clinical reports that discuss the prevalence and recognition of orthostatic myoclonus in individuals with unsteadiness. By reviewing the literature, we can determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the claim that orthostatic myoclonus is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
