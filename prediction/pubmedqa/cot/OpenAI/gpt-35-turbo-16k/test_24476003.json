    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nasogastric decompression is a procedure in which a tube is inserted through the nose and into the stomach to remove excess air and fluid. The purpose of nasogastric decompression is to relieve gastric distension and prevent complications such as vomiting and aspiration. In the context of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove a portion of the stomach to reduce its size, the use of nasogastric decompression is not universally agreed upon. Some studies suggest that nasogastric decompression may be beneficial in preventing leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy by reducing gastric pressure and preventing distension. However, other studies have found no significant difference in leak rates with or without nasogastric decompression. Given the conflicting evidence, the answer to the question is uncertain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
