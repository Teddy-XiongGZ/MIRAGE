    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if risk calculators accurately predict surgical site occurrences, we need to consider the evidence and research available. First, we should review studies that have evaluated the accuracy of risk calculators in predicting surgical site occurrences. This will involve looking at the methodology, sample size, and statistical analysis used in these studies. Additionally, we should consider any limitations or biases that may be present in the research. Based on the available evidence, we can then make an informed decision on whether risk calculators accurately predict surgical site occurrences.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
