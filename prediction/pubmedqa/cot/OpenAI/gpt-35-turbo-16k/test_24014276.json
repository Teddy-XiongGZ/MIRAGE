    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether an optimistic outlook predicts better survival at advanced ages, we need to consider the available evidence. First, we can look at studies that have investigated the relationship between optimism and survival. These studies typically involve following a group of individuals over a period of time and assessing their level of optimism and subsequent survival outcomes. Second, we can examine the potential mechanisms through which optimism may influence survival. For example, optimism has been associated with healthier behaviors, better coping strategies, and stronger social support networks, all of which could contribute to improved survival. Finally, we can consider any conflicting evidence or limitations in the research. Based on this step-by-step analysis, we can then choose the most appropriate answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
