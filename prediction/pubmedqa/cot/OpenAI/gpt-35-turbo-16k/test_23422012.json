    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vancomycin MIC creep refers to the phenomenon where the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin needed to inhibit the growth of bacteria gradually increases over time. To determine if vancomycin MIC creep is a worldwide phenomenon, we need to consider the available evidence. This can be done by reviewing studies and data from different regions and countries.
