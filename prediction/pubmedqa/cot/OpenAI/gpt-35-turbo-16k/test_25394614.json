    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether the timing of initial surfactant treatment makes a difference in rates of chronic lung disease or mortality in premature infants, we need to review the available evidence. This can be done by conducting a systematic review of relevant studies. The review should include randomized controlled trials that compare different timing of surfactant treatment in premature infants and assess the outcomes of chronic lung disease and mortality. By analyzing the results of these studies, we can determine if there is a significant difference in rates of chronic lung disease or mortality based on the timing of initial surfactant treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
