    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if flexible instruments can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, we need to consider the following factors: 1. Flexibility of the instruments: Flexible instruments are designed to navigate through tight spaces and angles, which may be necessary to create the desired tunnel length at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion. 2. Surgical technique: The surgeon's skill and experience in using flexible instruments will play a crucial role in achieving the desired tunnel length. 3. Patient anatomy: The anatomy of the patient's knee, including the size and shape of the femoral condyles, can affect the ability to create adequate tunnel lengths. 4. Surgical outcomes: Previous studies or clinical evidence that have evaluated the use of flexible instruments in ACL reconstruction can provide insights into their effectiveness in creating adequate tunnel lengths at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
