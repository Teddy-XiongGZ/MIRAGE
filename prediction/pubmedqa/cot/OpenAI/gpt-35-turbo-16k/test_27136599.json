    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In gynaecological debulking surgery, rectal anastomosis involves connecting two ends of the rectum after removing a portion of it. The purpose of a diverting stoma is to divert the fecal stream away from the anastomosis site, reducing the risk of complications such as anastomotic leak. Without a diverting stoma, there is a higher risk of anastomotic leak. Therefore, it is generally not safe to perform rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
