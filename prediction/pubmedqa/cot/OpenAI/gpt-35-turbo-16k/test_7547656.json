    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine impairs uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, we need to consider the effects of epinephrine on blood vessels and the potential impact on uterine blood flow. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it causes blood vessels to constrict. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to certain areas of the body. In the case of pregnant ewes, uterine blood flow is crucial for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the developing fetus. If epinephrine constricts the blood vessels supplying the uterus, it could potentially impair uterine blood flow. Therefore, the answer to the question is likely either 'yes' or 'maybe'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
