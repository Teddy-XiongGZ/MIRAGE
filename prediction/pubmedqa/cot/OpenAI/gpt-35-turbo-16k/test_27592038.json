    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if multi-modal cervical physical therapy improves tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus, we need to consider the available evidence. First, we need to understand what cervicogenic somatic tinnitus is. Cervicogenic somatic tinnitus is a type of tinnitus that is caused by dysfunction in the cervical spine. Next, we need to look at studies that have investigated the effects of multi-modal cervical physical therapy on tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus. By reviewing the available literature, we can determine if there is evidence to support the use of multi-modal cervical physical therapy for improving tinnitus in these patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
