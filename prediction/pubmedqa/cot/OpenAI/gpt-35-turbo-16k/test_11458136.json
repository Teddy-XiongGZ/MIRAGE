    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Managed care refers to a system of healthcare delivery that aims to control costs and improve quality by coordinating and managing the care of patients. It typically involves the use of a network of healthcare providers who agree to provide services to patients at pre-negotiated rates. Low income persons often face barriers to accessing healthcare, including lack of insurance coverage and limited financial resources.
