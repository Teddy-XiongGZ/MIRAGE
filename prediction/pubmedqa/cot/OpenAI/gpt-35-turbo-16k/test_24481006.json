    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. Cavitation refers to the formation of a cavity or hole in a tooth or bone. 2. Proximal surfaces refer to the surfaces of teeth that are adjacent to each other. 3. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a type of imaging technique that provides detailed 3D images of the teeth and surrounding structures. 4. Cavitation in proximal surfaces can indicate the presence of dental caries or other pathological conditions. 5. Reporting cavitation in CBCT examination can help in diagnosing and planning appropriate treatment for the patient. 6. Therefore, the answer is A. yes, cavitation in proximal surfaces should be reported in cone beam computed tomography examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
