    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma refers to a type of liver cancer that is characterized by the cancer cells resembling normal liver cells. The term 'well differentiated' indicates that the cancer cells are similar in appearance to normal liver cells. Clinically, 'early cancer' typically refers to cancer that is detected at an early stage, before it has spread to other parts of the body. Therefore, the prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma can be considered as early cancer if it is detected at an early stage and has not spread.

Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
