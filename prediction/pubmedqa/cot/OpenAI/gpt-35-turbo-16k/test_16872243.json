    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the roles of decisional algorithms and global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs. Decisional algorithms are computer-based algorithms that use predefined rules and criteria to assess the causality of an adverse drug reaction (ADR). Global introspection, on the other hand, involves a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medical history, clinical presentation, and other relevant factors to determine the likelihood of the ADR being caused by the drug. 1. Decisional algorithms: These algorithms are designed to provide a standardized and objective approach to causality assessment. They use predefined criteria such as the temporal relationship between drug administration and the onset of the ADR, the presence of alternative explanations, and the drug's known pharmacological properties to determine the likelihood of causality. Decisional algorithms can be useful in quickly assessing large volumes of spontaneously reported ADRs and identifying potential signals for further investigation. 2. Global introspection: This approach involves a more comprehensive evaluation of the individual patient and their specific circumstances. It takes into account factors such as the patient's medical history, concomitant medications, underlying diseases, and other relevant clinical information. Global introspection allows for a more nuanced and individualized assessment of causality, taking into consideration the unique characteristics of each patient. Based on this understanding, it is unlikely that decisional algorithms can completely replace global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs. While decisional algorithms can provide a standardized and efficient approach, they may not capture all the relevant clinical information and nuances that can influence causality assessment. Global introspection allows for a more holistic evaluation and consideration of individual patient factors, which is important in accurately assessing causality. Therefore, the answer to the question is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
