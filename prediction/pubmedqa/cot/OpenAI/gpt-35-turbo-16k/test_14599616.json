    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lymphedema is a condition characterized by swelling in the arms or legs due to a blockage in the lymphatic system. Early detection of lymphedema is important for timely intervention and management. To determine if a practicing surgeon can reliably detect early lymphedema, we need to consider their training and expertise in recognizing the signs and symptoms of this condition. Surgeons receive extensive training in anatomy and physiology, including the lymphatic system. They also have experience in performing surgeries that may involve the lymph nodes. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a practicing surgeon would have the knowledge and skills to detect early lymphedema reliably.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
