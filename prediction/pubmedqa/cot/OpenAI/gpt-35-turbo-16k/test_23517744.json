    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if a solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia, we need to consider the physiological changes that occur in a solitary kidney. Ischemia refers to a lack of blood supply to an organ or tissue, which can lead to tissue damage. In a solitary kidney, there is only one functioning kidney, which means that it has to compensate for the loss of the other kidney's function. This compensation can lead to hypertrophy (enlargement) of the solitary kidney. Hypertrophy can increase the blood supply to the kidney, which may provide some level of protection against ischemia. However, it is important to note that the presence of a solitary kidney does not guarantee complete resistance to ischemia. Other factors such as underlying health conditions, blood flow, and duration of ischemia can also influence the kidney's response to ischemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
