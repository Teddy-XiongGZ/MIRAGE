    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents, we need to consider the purpose of oblique views and their potential benefits. Oblique views are additional radiographic views that are taken at an angle to the standard views. They are often used to provide a different perspective and improve visualization of certain structures. In the case of spondylolysis, oblique views can help to better visualize the pars interarticularis, which is the most common site of injury in spondylolysis. By obtaining oblique views, it may be possible to detect spondylolysis that may not be visible on standard views. Therefore, oblique views may add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
