    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if surrogates of injury severity influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum, we need to consider the available evidence. This would involve reviewing relevant studies or literature that have investigated this relationship. By examining the findings of these studies, we can determine if there is a clear association between injury severity surrogates and the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in acetabular fractures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
