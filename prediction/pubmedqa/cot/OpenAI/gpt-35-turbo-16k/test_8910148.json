    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if marginally acceptable hearts in brain-dead patients are suitable for transplantation, we need to assess the left ventricular function using transesophageal echocardiography. This imaging technique provides detailed information about the structure and function of the heart. By evaluating the left ventricular function, we can determine if the heart is capable of pumping blood effectively. If the left ventricular function is within an acceptable range, it suggests that the heart is suitable for transplantation. If the left ventricular function is significantly impaired, it may indicate that the heart is not suitable for transplantation. Therefore, the answer to the question depends on the results of the transesophageal echocardiographic assessment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
