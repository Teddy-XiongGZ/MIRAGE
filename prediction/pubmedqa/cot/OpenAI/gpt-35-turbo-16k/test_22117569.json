First, we need to assess the availability of resources and infrastructure in the community palliative care setting. This includes the presence of trained healthcare professionals who can facilitate advance care planning discussions and documentation. Second, we need to consider the willingness and readiness of patients and their families to engage in advance care planning. This can be influenced by cultural, religious, and personal beliefs. Third, we need to evaluate the effectiveness of the advance care planning model in improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.
