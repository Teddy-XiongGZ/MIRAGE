    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Confined placental mosaicism refers to the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in the placenta but not in the fetus. IVF pregnancies are known to have a slightly higher risk of certain adverse perinatal outcomes compared to natural pregnancies. To determine if confined placental mosaicism accounts for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies, we need to consider the available evidence. Several studies have investigated this association, and the current evidence suggests that confined placental mosaicism alone does not significantly increase the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies. However, it is important to note that other factors, such as maternal age, underlying medical conditions, and the specific chromosomal abnormalities present in the placenta, can still contribute to adverse outcomes. Therefore, the answer to the question is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
