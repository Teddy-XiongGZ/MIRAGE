    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. Uveal melanoma is a type of cancer that affects the eye. 2. c-Kit is a protein that plays a role in cell growth and survival. 3. The question is asking whether c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells could be a potential therapeutic target. 4. To determine this, we need to consider if targeting c-Kit could potentially inhibit the growth of uveal melanoma cells. 5. Studies have shown that c-Kit mutations are present in a subset of uveal melanoma cases. 6. Inhibition of c-Kit signaling has been shown to have anti-tumor effects in other types of cancer. 7. Therefore, it is possible that targeting c-Kit could be a potential therapeutic strategy for uveal melanoma. 8. Based on this information, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
