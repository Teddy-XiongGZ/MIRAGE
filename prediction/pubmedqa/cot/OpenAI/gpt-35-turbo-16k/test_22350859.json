    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages are designed to inform and educate smokers about the health risks associated with smoking. These labels typically include graphic images and text that highlight the harmful effects of smoking, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and other smoking-related illnesses. The goal of these warning labels is to discourage smoking and encourage smokers to quit. In terms of addressing smoking-related health disparities, it is important to consider the factors that contribute to these disparities. Smoking-related health disparities can be influenced by various factors such as socioeconomic status, education level, access to healthcare, and cultural beliefs. While pictorial warning labels can be effective in raising awareness about the health risks of smoking, they may not directly address the underlying factors that contribute to smoking-related health disparities. These labels alone may not be sufficient to overcome the complex social, economic, and cultural factors that contribute to disparities in smoking rates and related health outcomes. Therefore, the answer to the question 'Can pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages address smoking-related health disparities?' is C. maybe. Pictorial warning labels can play a role in raising awareness and encouraging behavior change, but they may not be the sole solution to addressing smoking-related health disparities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
