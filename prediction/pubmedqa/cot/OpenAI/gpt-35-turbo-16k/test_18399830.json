    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy, we need to compare the invasiveness of the two procedures. 1. Robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: This procedure involves the use of a robotic system to assist the surgeon in performing a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. It is a minimally invasive procedure that uses small incisions and a camera to remove the prostate gland. 2. Retropubic radical prostatectomy: This procedure involves making a larger incision in the lower abdomen to access and remove the prostate gland. It is a more invasive procedure compared to laparoscopic surgery. Based on this information, we can conclude that robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
