    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) is a measure of the maximum amount of oxygen that an individual can utilize during exercise. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) is the highest rate at which oxygen can be taken up and utilized by the body during intense exercise. In healthy individuals, VO2peak and VO2max are generally considered to be equivalent. However, in individuals with spina bifida who are ambulatory, there may be limitations in their ability to reach their true maximum oxygen uptake due to factors such as muscle weakness or impaired cardiovascular function. Therefore, it is possible that peak oxygen uptake may not accurately reflect maximum oxygen uptake in children with spina bifida who are ambulatory.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
