    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During kidney allograft preservation, it is important to monitor the temperature. The reason for this is that maintaining the organ at an appropriate temperature is crucial for its viability and function. If the temperature is too low, it can lead to hypothermia and damage to the organ. On the other hand, if the temperature is too high, it can cause hyperthermia and also harm the organ. Therefore, monitoring the temperature during kidney allograft preservation is necessary to ensure optimal conditions for the organ's preservation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
