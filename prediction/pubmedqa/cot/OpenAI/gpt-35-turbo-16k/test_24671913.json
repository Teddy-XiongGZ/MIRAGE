    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The SYNTAX score is a tool used to assess the complexity of coronary artery disease. It takes into account the number, location, and severity of coronary artery lesions. ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment, often with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this context, the SYNTAX score may be used to guide decision-making regarding the extent of revascularization. To determine if the SYNTAX score predicts in-hospital outcomes in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, we need to review relevant studies or evidence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
