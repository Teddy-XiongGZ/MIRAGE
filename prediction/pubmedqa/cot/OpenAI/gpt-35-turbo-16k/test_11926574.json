    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if hepatitis G virus and TT virus are involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease, we need to consider the current scientific evidence. First, we need to understand that cryptogenic chronic liver disease refers to liver disease of unknown cause. Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is a bloodborne virus that can cause chronic hepatitis, but its role in cryptogenic chronic liver disease is not well-established. TT virus (TTV) is a nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that has been detected in the blood of patients with liver disease, but its clinical significance is still unclear. Given the limited evidence, it is difficult to definitively say whether HGV and TTV are involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
