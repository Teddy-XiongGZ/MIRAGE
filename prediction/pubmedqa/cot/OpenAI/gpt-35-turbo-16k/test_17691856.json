    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether midwives' competence is affected by working in a rural location, we need to consider several factors. Firstly, rural locations often have limited resources and access to specialized medical facilities, which may impact the training and continuing education opportunities available to midwives. This could potentially affect their competence. Secondly, rural areas may have a smaller population and lower patient volume, which could result in less exposure to a variety of cases and potentially impact the midwives' skills and experience. Lastly, rural communities may have unique healthcare needs and cultural considerations that midwives need to be familiar with in order to provide effective care. Considering these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that midwives' competence may be affected by working in a rural location.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
