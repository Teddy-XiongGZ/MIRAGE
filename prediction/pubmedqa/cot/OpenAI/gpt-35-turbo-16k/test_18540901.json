    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a common respiratory disorder in newborns, characterized by rapid breathing shortly after birth. It is typically caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. The beta-adrenergic receptors (ADRB) are involved in regulating lung fluid clearance. Polymorphisms in the ADRB encoding genes could potentially affect the function of these receptors and therefore contribute to the development of TTN. To determine if there is a role for polymorphisms in the ADRB encoding genes in TTN, further research and studies would be needed. Therefore, the answer is maybe (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
