    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if there is an improvement in the bactericidal activity of the antiseptic solutions in the presence of interfering substances, we need to consider the NF EN 13727 European Standard. This standard specifies the test method for evaluating the bactericidal activity of antiseptic solutions. If the standard has been updated to include the evaluation of bactericidal activity in the presence of interfering substances, then there may be an improvement. If the standard has not been updated or does not include this evaluation, then there may not be an improvement. Therefore, we need to check if the NF EN 13727 European Standard has been updated to include the evaluation of bactericidal activity in the presence of interfering substances.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
