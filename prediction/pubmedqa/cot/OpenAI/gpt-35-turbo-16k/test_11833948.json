    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether a delay in transfer to a rehabilitation unit for older people affects outcome after fracture of the proximal femur, we need to consider the potential impact of such a delay. Delay in transfer may lead to prolonged immobilization, which can increase the risk of complications such as pressure ulcers, pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis. Additionally, delayed transfer may result in delayed initiation of rehabilitation, which can impact functional recovery and overall outcome. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a delay in transfer to a rehabilitation unit for older people would affect the outcome after fracture of the proximal femur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
