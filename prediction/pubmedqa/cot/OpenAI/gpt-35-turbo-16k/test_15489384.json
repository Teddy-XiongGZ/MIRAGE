    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reducing spasticity refers to decreasing the involuntary muscle contractions that are characteristic of spasticity. To determine if reducing spasticity translates into functional benefit, we need to consider the relationship between spasticity and functional impairment. Spasticity can cause muscle stiffness, decreased range of motion, and difficulty with movement, which can impact a person's ability to perform daily activities. Therefore, if reducing spasticity leads to improved muscle flexibility, increased range of motion, and enhanced movement, it is likely to result in functional benefit. However, it is important to note that functional benefit may also depend on other factors such as the underlying condition causing spasticity and the individual's overall health and rehabilitation program.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
