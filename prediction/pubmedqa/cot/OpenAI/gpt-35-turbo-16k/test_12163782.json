    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. Major trauma can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response.\\n2. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the inflammatory response.\\n3. Increased neutrophil migratory activity can contribute to tissue damage and inflammation.\\n4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe inflammatory lung condition that can occur as a result of SIRS.\\n5. Neutrophil activation and migration into the lungs can contribute to the development of ARDS.\\nBased on these steps, it is likely that increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma is a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
