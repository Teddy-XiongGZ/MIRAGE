    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether a novel surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint can improve access and reduce complications, we need to consider the evidence and research available. First, we can review any published studies or clinical trials that have investigated this surgical approach. We can look for data on the success rates, outcomes, and complications associated with the novel approach compared to traditional approaches. Additionally, we can consider the theoretical advantages of the novel approach, such as improved visualization or reduced tissue trauma. By evaluating the available evidence and considering the potential benefits and risks, we can determine whether the novel surgical approach is likely to improve access and reduce complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
