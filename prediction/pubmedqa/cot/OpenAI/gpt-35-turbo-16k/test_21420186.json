    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. ADMA (asymmetric dimethylarginine) is a biomarker that is associated with endothelial dysfunction. 2. The question asks whether ADMA levels in young adults born preterm can predict early endothelial dysfunction. 3. To answer this question, we need to consider if there is any evidence linking ADMA levels in young adults born preterm with early endothelial dysfunction. 4. Research studies have shown that preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of endothelial dysfunction. 5. ADMA levels have been found to be elevated in individuals with endothelial dysfunction. 6. Therefore, it is possible that ADMA levels in young adults born preterm could predict early endothelial dysfunction. 7. Based on the available evidence, the answer is 'A. yes'.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
