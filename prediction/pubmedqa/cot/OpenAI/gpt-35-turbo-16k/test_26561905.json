    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns, we need to consider the following factors:\\n\\n1. Access to oncology expertise: Teleoncology models of care involve the use of telecommunication technology to connect patients in rural towns with oncology specialists located in urban areas. This allows for remote consultations and discussions about treatment plans. If there is sufficient access to oncology expertise through teleoncology, it may enable safe delivery of chemotherapy.\\n\\n2. Availability of necessary infrastructure: Teleoncology requires reliable internet connectivity and appropriate telecommunication equipment. If the rural towns have the necessary infrastructure in place, it can support the safe delivery of chemotherapy through teleoncology models of care.\\n\\n3. Local healthcare support: While teleoncology can facilitate remote consultations, it is important to consider the availability of local healthcare support in rural towns. This includes nurses or healthcare professionals who can administer chemotherapy and monitor patients during treatment. If there is adequate local healthcare support, it can contribute to the safe delivery of chemotherapy through teleoncology.\\n\\nBased on these factors, the answer to the question can be determined.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
