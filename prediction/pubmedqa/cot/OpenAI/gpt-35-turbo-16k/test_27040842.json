    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Septoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to correct a deviated septum, which is the displacement of the bone and cartilage that divides the nasal cavity into two nostrils. Compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate refers to the enlargement of the middle turbinate, which can occur as a compensatory response to a deviated septum. Septoplasty aims to correct the deviated septum and improve nasal airflow. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that septoplasty may potentially change the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate. However, to provide a definite answer, further research or clinical evidence is required.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
