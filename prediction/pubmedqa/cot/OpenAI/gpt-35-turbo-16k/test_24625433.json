    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether high flow nasal cannulae are noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants, we need to consider the characteristics of both devices. High flow nasal cannulae deliver a high flow of oxygen or air through small prongs that fit into the infant's nostrils. Bubble CPAP, on the other hand, delivers a continuous positive airway pressure through nasal prongs or a mask. In terms of noise, high flow nasal cannulae generate noise due to the high flow of gas passing through the prongs, while bubble CPAP may produce noise from the continuous positive airway pressure generator. Therefore, based on this information, the answer is A. yes, high flow nasal cannulae are noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
