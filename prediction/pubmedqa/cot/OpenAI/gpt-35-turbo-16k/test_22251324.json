    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether performance in selection processes predicts performance as a dental student, we need to consider the factors involved. 1. Selection processes: The question refers to performance in selection processes, which could include interviews, exams, and other assessments used to evaluate candidates for dental school. These processes are designed to identify individuals who are likely to succeed in dental school. 2. Predicting performance: The question asks whether performance in selection processes predicts performance as a dental student. This implies that there is a relationship between the two. 3. Research evidence: To answer the question, we can look at research studies that have investigated the relationship between performance in selection processes and performance as a dental student. Based on these steps, we can now choose the answer.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
