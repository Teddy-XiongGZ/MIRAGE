    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Landolt C and Snellen E acuity are both tests used to measure visual acuity. Strabismus amblyopia is a condition where there is reduced vision in one eye due to misalignment or crossed eyes. To determine if there are differences in visual acuity between Landolt C and Snellen E tests in strabismus amblyopia, we need to consider the characteristics of each test and how they may be affected by the condition. Landolt C test involves identifying the orientation of a gap in a ring, while Snellen E test involves identifying the direction of the letter E. Both tests require good visual acuity and the ability to accurately perceive and identify the stimuli. In strabismus amblyopia, the misalignment or crossed eyes can affect the ability to accurately perceive and identify the stimuli in both tests. Therefore, it is possible that there may be differences in visual acuity between Landolt C and Snellen E tests in strabismus amblyopia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
