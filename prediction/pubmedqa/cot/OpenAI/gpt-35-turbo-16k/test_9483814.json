    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if para-cervical block offers additional advantages in abortion induction with gemeprost in the 2nd trimester, we need to consider the available evidence. The para-cervical block is a local anesthetic injection given around the cervix to reduce pain during certain procedures. Gemeprost is a medication used for abortion induction. To answer this question, we need to review studies or clinical trials that have compared the outcomes of abortion induction with gemeprost alone versus gemeprost with para-cervical block in the 2nd trimester. By examining the results of these studies, we can determine if the para-cervical block provides any additional advantages in terms of pain control or other outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
