    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is a technique that measures the random motion of water molecules in tissues. It is commonly used in the detection and characterization of various types of cancer. In the case of uterine endometrial cancer, DWI can be helpful in the detection of cancer even in nonenhanced MR imaging. This is because cancer cells typically have a higher cellularity and restricted diffusion compared to normal tissues. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, DWI is helpful in the detection of cancer in nonenhanced MR imaging.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
