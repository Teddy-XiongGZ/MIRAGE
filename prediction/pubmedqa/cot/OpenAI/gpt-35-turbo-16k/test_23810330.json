    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME, we need to review the available evidence. First, we should look for relevant studies or systematic reviews that have investigated this topic. We can search medical databases such as PubMed or Cochrane Library. Once we have identified relevant studies, we should assess their quality and consider factors such as study design, sample size, and statistical analysis. Finally, we can analyze the results of these studies to determine if there is a consistent association between intraoperative neuromonitoring and better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
