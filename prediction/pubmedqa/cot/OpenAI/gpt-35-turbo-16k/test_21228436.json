    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether teaching medical students to investigate medication errors can change their attitudes towards patient safety, we need to consider the following steps:\\n\\n1. Review existing literature: We should examine any previous studies or research that have investigated the impact of teaching medical students about medication errors on their attitudes towards patient safety.\\n\\n2. Design and conduct a study: If there is limited or no existing research, we may need to design and conduct a study to gather data on the topic. This could involve implementing a teaching intervention for a group of medical students and measuring their attitudes towards patient safety before and after the intervention.\\n\\n3. Analyze the data: Once the data is collected, we can analyze it to determine if there is a significant change in the attitudes of medical students towards patient safety after being taught about medication errors.\\n\\nBased on the available information, it is not possible to definitively answer the question without conducting further research or reviewing existing literature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
