    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether the treatment of amblyopia normalizes subfoveal choroidal thickness in amblyopic children, we need to review relevant studies. We should look for studies that specifically investigate the effect of amblyopia treatment on subfoveal choroidal thickness in children with amblyopia. We can then analyze the results of these studies to determine if the treatment has a normalizing effect on subfoveal choroidal thickness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
