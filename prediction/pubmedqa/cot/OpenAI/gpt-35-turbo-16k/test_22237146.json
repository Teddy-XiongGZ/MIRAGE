    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. EGFR mutation status is commonly analyzed in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to guide treatment decisions. 2. Traditionally, EGFR mutation analysis is performed on tissue samples obtained through biopsy or surgery. 3. However, in recent years, there has been growing interest in using liquid biopsies, such as serum, for EGFR mutation analysis. 4. Liquid biopsies involve the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or other biomarkers in the blood. 5. Several studies have shown that serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 6. These studies have demonstrated high concordance rates between serum and tissue samples in detecting EGFR mutations. 7. The use of serum for EGFR mutation analysis offers several advantages, including its non-invasive nature and the ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response over time. 8. Therefore, the answer is A. yes, serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
