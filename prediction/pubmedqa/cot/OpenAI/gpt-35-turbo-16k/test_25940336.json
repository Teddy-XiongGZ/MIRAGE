    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if residency selection criteria predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency, we need to consider the available evidence. One way to assess this is by reviewing relevant research studies that have investigated the relationship between residency selection criteria and performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. We should look for studies that have examined the correlation between specific selection criteria, such as USMLE scores, letters of recommendation, and interview performance, with objective measures of performance during residency, such as surgical case volume, surgical outcomes, and performance evaluations. By reviewing the findings of these studies, we can determine if there is a consistent and significant relationship between residency selection criteria and performance in orthopaedic surgery residency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
