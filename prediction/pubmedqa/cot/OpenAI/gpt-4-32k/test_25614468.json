    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gastric cancer staging is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan. The most common methods for staging gastric cancer include endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is not typically the first choice for gastric cancer staging due to its limitations in visualizing the stomach wall layers and nearby lymph nodes. However, it can be used in certain cases where other imaging modalities are contraindicated or insufficient. Therefore, while it's not the primary method, there is a place for MRI in the preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
