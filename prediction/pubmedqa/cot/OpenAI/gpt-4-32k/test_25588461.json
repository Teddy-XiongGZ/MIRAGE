    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure that uses direct electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain. It has been used in research to help improve cognitive function, mood disorders, and other neurological conditions.

These two conditions are differentiated based on clinical assessments and observations, not brain stimulation techniques.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
