    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rectal anastomosis is a surgical procedure that connects two parts of the rectum after a portion has been removed. In gynaecological debulking surgery, the goal is to remove as much of a malignant tumor as possible. Performing a rectal anastomosis in this context could potentially lead to complications such as anastomotic leakage, which can be life-threatening. A diverting stoma is often created to allow the anastomosis to heal and to prevent fecal matter from passing through the anastomosis site, reducing the risk of leakage. Therefore, it is generally not considered safe to perform rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
