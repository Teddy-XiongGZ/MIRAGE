    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire is a tool that is used to identify symptoms of low testosterone in men. It is a self-administered questionnaire that asks about various symptoms that could be related to low testosterone levels. These symptoms include decreased libido, lack of energy, decrease in strength or endurance, loss of height, decreased enjoyment of life, sadness or grumpiness, deterioration in sports ability, falling asleep after dinner, and decreased work performance. If a man answers 'yes' to question 1 or 7 or any three other questions, he is considered to have symptomatic androgen deficiency. Therefore, the ADAM questionnaire is indeed useful for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency in aging men.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
