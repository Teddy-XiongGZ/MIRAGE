    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mesopic pupil size refers to the size of the pupil under conditions of intermediate light, between photopic (bright light) and scotopic (low light) conditions. The cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method is a tool used to examine the anterior segment, or frontal structures and posterior segment of the human eye, which includes the eyelid, sclera, conjunctiva, iris, natural crystalline lens, and cornea. However, this method is not typically used to measure pupil size, especially not under mesopic conditions. Therefore, it is not suitable for measuring mesopic pupil size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
