Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task. Transformational leadership is a style of leadership where a leader works with subordinates to identify needed change, creating a vision to guide the change through inspiration, and executing the change in tandem with committed members of a group.
