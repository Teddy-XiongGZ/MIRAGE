    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a complex structure, and its internal derangement can lead to various symptoms like pain, clicking, and limited jaw movement. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and readily available imaging modality that can be used to assess the TMJ. It can provide real-time dynamic imaging and can be used to guide interventions. However, it has limitations in terms of depth penetration and resolution compared to other imaging modalities like MRI. Despite these limitations, it still has a place in the diagnostic algorithm, especially in cases where other imaging modalities are contraindicated or not available.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
