    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PSA, or Prostate-Specific Antigen, is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man\u2019s blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. The interpretation of a PSA level can be complex and should be discussed with the doctor. A fluctuating PSA level does not necessarily mean that there is no cancer. It could be due to various factors such as prostate inflammation, enlargement, or even due to certain medications. Therefore, a biopsy may still be necessary to confirm the presence or absence of cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
