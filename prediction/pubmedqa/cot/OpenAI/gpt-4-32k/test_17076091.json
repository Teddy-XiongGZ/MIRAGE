    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep due to throat muscles intermittently relaxing and blocking the airway. This results in lower quality sleep, leading to daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Aerobic fitness requires good lung function and cardiovascular health. If a person is constantly tired due to poor sleep, they may not be able to exercise as effectively, which could impact their aerobic fitness. Moreover, the intermittent hypoxia (low oxygen levels) experienced during sleep apnea episodes can also negatively affect cardiovascular health, which is crucial for aerobic fitness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
