    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery is a procedural detail that can influence the risk of distal embolisation. This is because the sequence of clamping can affect the flow of blood and potential clots or plaque within the aorta. If the aorta is clamped in a sequence that allows for blood and potential emboli to be directed towards the lower body, there is a risk of distal embolisation. Therefore, the sequence of clamp application does have an influence on the risk of distal embolisation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
