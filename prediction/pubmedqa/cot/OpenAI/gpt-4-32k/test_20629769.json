    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Primary angioplasty is a procedure used to treat heart attacks. It's done by inserting a catheter into the blocked artery and inflating a small balloon to restore blood flow. Thrombolysis, on the other hand, is a treatment that involves injecting a clot-dissolving agent to restore blood flow in a coronary artery. Both are used to treat heart attacks, but primary angioplasty is often preferred because it's more effective at reducing the risk of death, another heart attack, or stroke. Therefore, primary angioplasty is not just an acceptable alternative, but often a preferred one.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
