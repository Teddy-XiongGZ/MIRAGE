    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sarcoidosis is a disease that results in the formation of granulomas, which are small clumps of inflammatory cells, in different parts of the body. When these granulomas form on the spinal cord, it can cause a condition known as spinal cord sarcoidosis. Compressive cervical myelopathy is a condition where the spinal cord in the neck is compressed, often due to conditions like herniated discs or spinal stenosis. Decompressive surgery is a type of surgery that aims to relieve this compression. Given that the compression is a physical issue, decompressive surgery can be effective in relieving the symptoms of compressive cervical myelopathy, even when it is accompanied by spinal cord sarcoidosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
