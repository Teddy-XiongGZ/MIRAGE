    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ADMA, or Asymmetric dimethylarginine, is a naturally occurring chemical found in blood plasma. It is a metabolic by-product of ongoing protein modification processes in the cytoplasm of all human cells. It is closely related to endothelial dysfunction because it is a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that has a crucial role in endothelial function. Preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, it is plausible that ADMA levels could be used as a predictive marker for early endothelial dysfunction in young adults born preterm. However, this would require further research and clinical studies to confirm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
