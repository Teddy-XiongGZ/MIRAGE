    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a condition that occurs when there is loss of blood to the bone. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect any part of the body, including the bones. Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are a group of immune proteins that the body mistakenly produces against itself in an autoimmune response. These antibodies are often found in people with autoimmune disorders like SLE. There is evidence suggesting that the presence of aPL in patients with SLE may increase the risk of AVN. This is because these antibodies can cause blood clots, which can block the blood supply to the bone, leading to AVN.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
