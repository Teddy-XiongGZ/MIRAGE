It is often seen in critically ill patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass is a technique that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs during surgery, maintaining the circulation of blood and the oxygen content of the body.

This can potentially affect the thyroid function and lead to euthyroid sick syndrome postoperatively.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
