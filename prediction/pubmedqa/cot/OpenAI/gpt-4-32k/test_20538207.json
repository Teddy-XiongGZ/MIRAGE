    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Kidney allograft preservation is a critical process that ensures the viability of the organ for transplantation. Temperature is a key factor in this process. If the temperature is too high, it can lead to cellular damage and decrease the viability of the organ. If it's too low, it can also harm the organ. Therefore, it's crucial to monitor the temperature during kidney allograft preservation to ensure the organ remains in the best possible condition for transplantation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
