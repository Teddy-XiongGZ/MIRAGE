    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of liver cancer. The term 'well-differentiated' refers to how much the cancer cells resemble normal cells. Well-differentiated cancer cells are similar to normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than poorly differentiated or undifferentiated cancer cells. However, the term 'early cancer' refers to the stage of the cancer, not its differentiation. Early cancer is usually used to describe cancer that has not spread beyond the organ where it started. Therefore, while well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma may have a better prognosis than other types, it is not necessarily 'early' cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
