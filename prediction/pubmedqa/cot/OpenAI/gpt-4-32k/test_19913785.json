    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand the terms. Choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis refers to an infection of the bile duct caused by gallstones. Endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct is a procedure to remove these gallstones. A nasobiliary drainage tube is a tube inserted through the nose and into the bile duct to allow bile to drain out. The necessity of this tube after endoscopic clearance is not universally agreed upon. Some studies suggest it may help reduce complications and improve patient outcomes, while others suggest it may not be necessary in all cases. Therefore, the decision to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis may depend on the individual patient's condition and the surgeon's judgement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
