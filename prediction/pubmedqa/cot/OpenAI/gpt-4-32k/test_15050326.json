    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hodgkin's disease is a type of lymphoma, which is a cancer that starts in cells that are part of the body's immune system. Radiotherapy is one of the treatments for Hodgkin's disease. It uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells. However, radiotherapy, especially when administered to the chest area, has been associated with an increased risk of developing secondary cancers, including breast cancer. This risk is particularly high in women who received radiotherapy at a young age. Therefore, if a woman received radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease around the time of pregnancy, it could potentially increase her risk of developing breast cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
