    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heterotopic ossification is the formation of bone in soft tissue where bone normally does not exist. This can occur after surgery, such as a total hip arthroplasty. Etoricoxib is a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is often used to manage pain and inflammation. There have been studies that show NSAIDs, including etoricoxib, can be effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after hip arthroplasty. Therefore, based on the current evidence, it can be said that etoricoxib is effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after primary total hip arthroplasty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
