    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, it's important to understand that low-tone sudden deafness is a condition characterized by a sudden loss of hearing, typically in one ear, that is more pronounced at low frequencies. Meniere's disease, on the other hand, is a disorder of the inner ear that can lead to dizzy spells (vertigo) and hearing loss, often in one ear. While low-tone sudden deafness can be a symptom of Meniere's disease, it does not mean that every case of low-tone sudden deafness will inevitably progress to Meniere's disease. There are many other potential causes of low-tone sudden deafness, including viral infections, blood circulation problems, and certain neurological disorders. Therefore, the prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness does not inevitably progress to Meniere's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
