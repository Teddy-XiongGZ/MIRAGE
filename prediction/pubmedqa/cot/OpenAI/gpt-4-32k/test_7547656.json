    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone that has vasoconstrictive effects, meaning it can cause blood vessels to narrow. This can potentially reduce blood flow in various parts of the body. However, the specific effect of low-concentration epinephrine on uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes is not universally established and may depend on various factors such as the exact concentration, the duration of the infusion, the overall health of the ewe, and the stage of pregnancy. Therefore, without specific research data, it's not possible to definitively say whether it impairs uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
