    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sternal skin conductance is a method that measures the electrical conductance of the skin at the sternum, which can increase during a hot flash due to increased sweating. Therefore, it can be considered a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement. However, it's important to note that it may not capture all hot flashes, especially those that are less intense or not accompanied by sweating. Therefore, while it can be a useful tool, it may not be 100% accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
