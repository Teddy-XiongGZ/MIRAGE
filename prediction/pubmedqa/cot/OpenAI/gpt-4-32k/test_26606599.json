    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heterotopic ossification is the process by which bone tissue forms outside of the skeleton, often after surgery or traumatic injury. Fractures of the acetabulum, the part of the pelvis that forms the hip joint, are severe injuries that can lead to this condition. The severity of the injury, including factors like the extent of the fracture, the presence of other injuries, and the patient's overall health, can influence the likelihood of heterotopic ossification occurring. Therefore, it can be inferred that surrogates of injury severity, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale or Injury Severity Score, could potentially influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
