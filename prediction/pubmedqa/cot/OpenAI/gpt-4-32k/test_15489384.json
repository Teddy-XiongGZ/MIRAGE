    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spasticity is a condition in which certain muscles are continuously contracted. This contraction causes stiffness or tightness of the muscles and can interfere with normal movement, speech, and gait. Reducing spasticity can help improve the range of motion and movement in patients. However, the functional benefit of reducing spasticity can vary from person to person. It depends on the severity of the spasticity, the overall health and strength of the patient, and the specific functional tasks the patient needs to perform. Therefore, while reducing spasticity can potentially lead to functional benefits, it's not guaranteed for every individual.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
