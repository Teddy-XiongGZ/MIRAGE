    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung condition that causes low oxygen levels in the blood. It can be caused by many factors, including major trauma. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the body's immune response. When the body experiences major trauma, neutrophils can become more active and migrate to the site of injury to help fight infection and promote healing. However, this increased activity can also lead to inflammation and damage to the lung tissue, which can contribute to the development of ARDS. Therefore, it is plausible that increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma could be a factor in the etiology of ARDS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
