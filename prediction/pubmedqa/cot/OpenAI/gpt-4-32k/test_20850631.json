    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The use of ultrasound in diagnosing and following up with constipated children is a matter of clinical judgement. Ultrasound can be a non-invasive tool to visualize the abdomen and assess for any structural abnormalities that may be causing constipation. However, it may not always be necessary as constipation in children is often functional, meaning it is not caused by an underlying disease or structural abnormality, but rather by factors such as diet or toilet training issues. Therefore, the decision to use ultrasound should be based on the individual patient's symptoms, history, and response to treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
