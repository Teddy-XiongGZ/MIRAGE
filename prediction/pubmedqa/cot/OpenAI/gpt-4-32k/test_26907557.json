    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the potential benefits of a new surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint. The temporomandibular joint is a complex structure, and surgery on it can be challenging and potentially lead to complications. A novel surgical approach could potentially improve access to the joint and reduce complications if it is designed to do so. However, without specific information about the novel approach, it's impossible to definitively say whether it would have these benefits. Therefore, the answer is not definitively yes or no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
