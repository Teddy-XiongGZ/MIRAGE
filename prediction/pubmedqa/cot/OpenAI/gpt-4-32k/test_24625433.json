    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High flow nasal cannulae and bubble CPAP are both respiratory support methods used for preterm infants. The noise level of these devices can vary based on the specific model and settings used. However, generally speaking, bubble CPAP systems are known to produce a characteristic 'bubbling' noise which can be quite loud, while high flow nasal cannulae are typically quieter. Therefore, high flow nasal cannulae are not noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
