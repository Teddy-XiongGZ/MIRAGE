    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cavitation refers to the formation of cavities or holes, often due to decay or disease. In dentistry, cavitation in proximal surfaces can be a sign of dental caries or other oral health issues. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a type of X-ray used often in dental practices that provides a 3D image of the teeth, soft tissues, nerve pathways, and bone in a single scan. It is a valuable tool for diagnosing and planning treatment. Therefore, if cavitation is present, it should be reported in a CBCT examination to ensure appropriate treatment planning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
