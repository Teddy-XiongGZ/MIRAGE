    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation exposure can have harmful effects on the human body, including reproductive health. Workers in nuclear power plants are exposed to ionizing radiation, which can cause damage to body cells, including reproductive cells. This can potentially affect conception and pregnancy. However, nuclear power plants have safety measures in place to limit the exposure of their workers to radiation, keeping it well below the level that could cause harm. Therefore, while there is a potential risk, it is generally controlled and minimized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
