    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The type of remission after a major depressive episode can indeed be an important risk factor for relapses in a 4-year follow up. This is because the nature of the remission can influence the likelihood of a relapse. For instance, if the remission is full, meaning that the individual no longer experiences any symptoms of depression, the risk of relapse may be lower.

Therefore, the type of remission is an important factor to consider when assessing the risk of relapse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
