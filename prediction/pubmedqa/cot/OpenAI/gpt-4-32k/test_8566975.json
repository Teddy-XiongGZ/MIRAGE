    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a bacterium that causes gonorrhea. Serovar specific immunity refers to the immune response that is specific to a particular strain or serovar of a bacterium. The immune response to Neisseria gonorrhoeae is complex and not fully understood. However, it is known that the bacterium has several mechanisms to evade the immune system, including antigenic variation and the production of a polysaccharide capsule that inhibits phagocytosis. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
