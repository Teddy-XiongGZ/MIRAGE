    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the potential impact of education on behavior, specifically in the context of medical residents ordering CT scans. The assumption is that if residents are more aware of the potential effects of radiation exposure, they might be more cautious in ordering these scans. However, this is not a guaranteed outcome. The impact of education on behavior can vary widely depending on a number of factors, including the individual's pre-existing knowledge and attitudes, the quality and effectiveness of the education, and the context in which the behavior occurs. Therefore, it's not possible to definitively say whether education will change CT ordering practices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
