    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland. The test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. The levels of PSA in the blood can be higher in men who have prostate cancer. The PSA levels can also be elevated in other conditions that affect the prostate. As for the body mass index (BMI), it is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. The PSA test is not influenced by a person's weight or BMI, but rather by the health and condition of their prostate gland. Therefore, there is no need to adjust PSA for BMI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
