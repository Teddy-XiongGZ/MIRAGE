    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oral endotracheal intubation is a procedure that is often performed in emergency situations to secure a patient's airway. The efficacy of this procedure can be influenced by many factors, including the skill level of the practitioner, the condition of the patient, and the environment in which the procedure is performed. In a helicopter environment, there may be additional challenges such as noise, vibration, and limited space, which could potentially impair the efficacy of the procedure. However, with proper training and equipment, these challenges can be managed. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that the efficacy of oral endotracheal intubation is always impaired in the helicopter environment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
