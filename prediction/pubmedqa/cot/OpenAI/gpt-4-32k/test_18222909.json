    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pectins are a type of polysaccharide that are found in the cell walls of plants. They play a role in plant growth and development, but their specific role in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed rape plants is not clearly defined. However, some studies suggest that pectins may be involved in the process of cold acclimation in plants by altering the structure and permeability of cell walls, which could help the plant to withstand cold temperatures. But without specific research or evidence on winter oil-seed rape plants, it's hard to definitively say.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
