    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pelvic organ prolapse is a condition where a pelvic organ, such as your bladder, drops (prolapses) from its normal place in your lower belly and pushes against the walls of your vagina. This can happen when the muscles that hold your pelvic organs in place get weak or stretched from childbirth or surgery. Symptoms can include a feeling of heaviness or pulling in your pelvis, a feeling like you're sitting on a small ball, painful intercourse, spotting or bleeding, urinary problems, and defecatory symptoms. Therefore, pelvic pain can indeed be associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
