    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking whether the difference in birthweights between Australian aborigines and whites can be explained by misclassification of gestational age. To answer this, we would need to have data on the birthweights of these two groups, as well as information on how gestational age was determined. Without this data, it is impossible to definitively say whether gestational age misclassification is the cause of the difference in birthweights. Therefore, the answer cannot be 'yes' or 'no'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
