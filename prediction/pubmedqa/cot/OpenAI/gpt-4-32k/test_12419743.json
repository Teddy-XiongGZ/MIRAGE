    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitoxantrone is a type of chemotherapy drug used in the treatment of certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, it is typically not used as a first-line treatment for high-risk metastatic breast cancer. Instead, a combination of chemotherapy drugs is usually used.

Therefore, first-line single-agent mitoxantrone is not as effective as combination chemotherapy in the treatment of high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
