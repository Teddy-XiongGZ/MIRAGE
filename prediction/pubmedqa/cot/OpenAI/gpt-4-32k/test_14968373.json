    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tuberculous hydrocephalus is a condition where there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to tuberculosis infection. A CT scan is a type of imaging that can provide detailed images of the brain and can show abnormalities such as hydrocephalus. However, while a CT scan can show the presence of hydrocephalus, it may not be able to accurately predict the level of CSF block. This is because the CT scan provides anatomical details, but the level of CSF block would require functional information, which might not be provided by a CT scan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
