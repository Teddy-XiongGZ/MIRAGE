    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It's a type of neural tube defect. The condition can cause physical and intellectual disabilities that range from mild to severe. The ability of children with spina bifida to perform physical activities such as walking can vary greatly. Treadmill testing is a common way to measure physical fitness and endurance. Peak oxygen uptake is the maximum amount of oxygen that can be used during intense exercise, while maximum oxygen uptake is the greatest amount of oxygen that can be used during maximal exercise. The relationship between these two measures in children with spina bifida who are ambulatory is not clear without specific research data.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
