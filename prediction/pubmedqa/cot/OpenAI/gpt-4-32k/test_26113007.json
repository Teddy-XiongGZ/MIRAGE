    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The arch form is primarily determined by the shape and size of the jaw, which is a genetic trait. The sagittal molar relationship refers to the anteroposterior relationship between the upper and lower molars, which is also largely determined by genetic factors and growth patterns. The Bolton tooth-size discrepancy refers to a mismatch in the total mesiodistal width of the twelve mandibular teeth and the twelve maxillary teeth. While these factors can influence the alignment and positioning of the teeth, they do not directly influence the arch form.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
