    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Trabecular bone is the spongy type of bone found at the ends of long bones, inside the spinal vertebrae, and inside the flat bones such as the pelvis. It has a higher surface area and is less dense than cortical bone. Miniscrews are often used in orthodontics and are placed in the jaw bone to provide anchorage for tooth movement. The primary stability of these miniscrews is determined by the quality and quantity of the bone in which they are placed. Trabecular bone, due to its spongy nature, provides a good site for the miniscrews to gain stability. Therefore, trabecular bone is related to the primary stability of miniscrews.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
