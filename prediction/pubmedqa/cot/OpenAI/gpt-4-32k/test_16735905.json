    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. The severity of obstructive sleep apnea can be determined by the frequency and duration of breathing interruptions. Patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea often require higher levels of CPAP to keep their airway open during sleep. Therefore, the severity of obstructive sleep apnea can predict the need for high continuous positive airway pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
