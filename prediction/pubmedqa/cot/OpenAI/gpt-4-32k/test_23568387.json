    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is a surgical procedure that replaces two of the three compartments of the knee. Total knee arthroplasty, on the other hand, replaces all three compartments of the knee. The choice between these two procedures depends on the extent of the knee damage and the patient's overall health. However, there is no definitive evidence to suggest that bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty. The outcomes of these procedures can vary greatly depending on individual patient factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
