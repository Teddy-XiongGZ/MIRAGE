    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Essential tremor and Parkinson's disease are two distinct neurological conditions. Essential tremor is a nerve disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking, or tremors, in different parts and on different sides of the body. Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. A DaTSCAN is a specific type of imaging that uses small amounts of a radioactive drug to help visualize the brain. It is used to differentiate Parkinson's disease from other movement disorders. Therefore, a DaTSCAN in patients with essential tremor would not show any correlation with Parkinson's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
