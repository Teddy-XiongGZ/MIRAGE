    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking whether nomograms, which are graphical calculating devices, do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant outcomes of prostate cancer than biochemical recurrence (BCR). BCR is a measure of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the blood, which can indicate the recurrence of prostate cancer. However, the effectiveness of nomograms in predicting more clinically relevant outcomes than BCR would depend on the specific nomogram and the outcomes being considered. Therefore, without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively say whether nomograms are better predictors than BCR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
