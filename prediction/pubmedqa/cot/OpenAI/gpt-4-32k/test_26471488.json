    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mammographic density refers to the proportion of different tissues in the breast as seen on a mammogram. Dense breasts have more glandular and connective tissue and less fatty tissue. This can make it harder to detect cancers on mammograms because both dense tissue and tumors appear white. Therefore, if a woman has high mammographic density, it might be more difficult to accurately determine the margins of a tumor during breast-conserving surgery, which could potentially lead to a higher rate of re-excision. However, this would also depend on other factors such as the skill and experience of the surgeon, the size and location of the tumor, and the use of additional imaging techniques.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
