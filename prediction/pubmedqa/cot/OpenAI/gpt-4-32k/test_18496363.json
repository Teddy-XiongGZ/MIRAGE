    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking whether hormonal differences are responsible for the gender dimorphism observed after injury and hemorrhagic shock. To answer this, we would need to consider the role of hormones in the body's response to injury and shock. Hormones can influence the body's response to stress, including injury and shock, and there are known differences in hormonal profiles between genders. However, without specific research data or studies to reference, it's impossible to definitively say whether these hormonal differences are the cause of the observed gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
