    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diffusion-weighted MR imaging is a technique that provides contrast based on the microscopic motion of water molecules in tissues. It is particularly useful in the detection of cancer because cancerous tissues often restrict water movement, leading to high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images. Therefore, it can be helpful in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer, even in nonenhanced MR imaging.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
