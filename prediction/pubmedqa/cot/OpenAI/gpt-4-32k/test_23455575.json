    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Globulomaxillary cysts were once thought to be a specific type of cyst occurring at the junction between the globular and maxillary processes. However, further research and studies have shown that these cysts are not a specific entity, but rather they are other types of cysts, such as radicular or residual cysts, that happen to occur in the globulomaxillary region. Therefore, in the specific sense of being a unique type of cyst, globulomaxillary cysts do not exist.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
