    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PET/CT is a type of imaging that combines positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) capabilities into one machine. A PET scan reveals how the body's cells are functioning, and a CT scan shows the body's anatomy. Therefore, PET/CT can provide a more complete picture of cancer's location and spread. In the case of liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma, a multidetector CT can provide detailed images of the liver and detect the presence of metastases. However, PET/CT can add more information about the metabolic activity of the detected lesions, which can be crucial for staging and treatment planning. Therefore, PET/CT does add something to multidetector CT in preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
