    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Running speed with changes of direction, also known as agility, is not solely dependent on muscle power. While muscle power can contribute to the ability to accelerate, decelerate, and change direction quickly, other factors such as balance, coordination, and proprioception also play significant roles. However, without sufficient muscle power, an individual may not be able to generate the necessary force to change direction quickly while running. Therefore, muscle power does have a relationship with running speed with changes of direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
