    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the impact of general practitioner hospitals on the utilisation of general hospital beds. Theoretically, if general practitioner hospitals are able to treat patients who would otherwise need to be admitted to a general hospital, then they could potentially reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds. However, this would depend on a variety of factors, including the capacity of the general practitioner hospitals, the types of conditions they are able to treat, and the overall demand for hospital beds. Therefore, without specific data or studies to reference, it's not possible to definitively say whether general practitioner hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
