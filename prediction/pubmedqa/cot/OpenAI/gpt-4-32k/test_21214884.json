    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of more than 200 related viruses. Some types of HPVs are considered 'high-risk' because they can cause cancer in humans. HPVs are usually transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact, especially during sexual activity. However, it's also possible for HPVs to be present in other body fluids, including breast milk. Several studies have found traces of HPV DNA in breast milk, suggesting that the virus can indeed be present in this fluid. Therefore, it's possible for 'high-risk' HPVs to be detected in human breast milk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
