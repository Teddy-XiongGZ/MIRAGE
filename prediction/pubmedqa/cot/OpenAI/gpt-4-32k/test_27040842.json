    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Septoplasty is a surgical procedure to correct a deviated septum. The middle turbinate is a structure in the nose that can become enlarged (hypertrophy) in response to chronic inflammation or other conditions. This is called compensatory hypertrophy.

Therefore, septoplasty should not directly change the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
