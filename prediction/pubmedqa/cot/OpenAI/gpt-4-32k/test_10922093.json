    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Open access endoscopy refers to a system where patients can be referred for endoscopic procedures without a prior consultation with the specialist who will perform the procedure. The concern here is whether this system allows for adequate patient information. However, this largely depends on the quality of the referral and the information provided by the referring physician. If the referring physician provides comprehensive information and ensures the patient understands the procedure, then open access endoscopy does not necessarily close the door to an adequately informed patient. Therefore, the system itself does not inherently prevent adequate patient information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
