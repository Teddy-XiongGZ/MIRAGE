    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Inhaled steroids and cromones are both used in the management of asthma. However, they have different mechanisms of action. Inhaled steroids work by reducing inflammation in the airways, while cromones work by preventing the release of substances that cause inflammation. Studies have shown that inhaled steroids are more effective in controlling asthma symptoms and preventing exacerbations, which could potentially lead to hospital admissions. Therefore, it is likely that there is a difference in hospital admission rates for asthma in children between those using inhaled steroids and those using cromones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
