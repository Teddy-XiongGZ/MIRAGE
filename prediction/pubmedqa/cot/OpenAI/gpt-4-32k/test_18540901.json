    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a respiratory problem that can occur in newborns soon after delivery. It's caused by fluid in the lungs. The beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) is involved in the regulation of heart rate and smooth muscle tone. Polymorphisms in the ADRB encoding genes could potentially affect the function of the receptor, which could in turn affect the respiratory function. However, there is currently no definitive research linking polymorphisms in the ADRB encoding genes to TTN.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
