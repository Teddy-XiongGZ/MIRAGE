    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cortisol excess, also known as hypercortisolism or Cushing's syndrome, is a condition characterized by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. The standard screening tests for cortisol excess include 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels, late-night salivary cortisol measurement, and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Each of these tests has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes, the standard tests may not be as reliable due to the effects of obesity and diabetes on cortisol metabolism. Late-night salivary cortisol is a non-invasive test that can be performed at home, and it measures the cortisol level at the time of day when it should be the lowest, thus potentially providing a more accurate indication of cortisol excess. However, the effectiveness of this test as a better screening tool than standard tests in this specific patient population is not definitively established and may depend on individual patient factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
