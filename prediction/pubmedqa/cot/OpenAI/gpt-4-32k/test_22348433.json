    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Partial expander deflation is a technique used in two-stage breast reconstruction to temporarily reduce the volume of the tissue expander prior to radiotherapy. This is done to minimize the radiation dose to the surrounding tissues and organs. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that partial expander deflation exacerbates the adverse effects of radiotherapy. In fact, it may help to reduce some of the side effects associated with radiotherapy such as skin changes and fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
