    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The term 'occult' in medical parlance refers to conditions that are not readily observable or detectable. Posttraumatic lesions of the knee are injuries that occur after a traumatic event like a fall or accident. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed images of the knee's internal structures. However, it may not always detect small or subtle injuries. On the other hand, diagnostic arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that allows doctors to view the knee joint directly, making it more accurate in diagnosing occult lesions. Therefore, while MRI can provide valuable information and may be used as a first-line tool for diagnosis, it cannot completely substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy when it comes to detecting occult posttraumatic lesions of the knee.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
