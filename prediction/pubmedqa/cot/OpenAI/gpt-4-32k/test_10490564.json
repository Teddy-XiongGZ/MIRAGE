    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypotension, or low blood pressure, can lead to decreased blood flow to the heart. In patients with coronary disease, their coronary arteries are already narrowed or blocked, which means their heart is already receiving less blood. If these patients experience hypotension, their heart may not receive enough blood to meet its needs, leading to myocardial ischemia, which is a condition where the heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen. Therefore, profound hypotensive events can indeed cause myocardial ischaemic events in patients with coronary disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
