    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking whether the combination of bracket and ligature in orthodontics affects the amount of space closure over a period of three months. To answer this, we would need to consider the role of the bracket and ligature in orthodontics. The bracket is the part of the braces that attaches to the tooth and holds the archwire in place, while the ligature is the small rubber band that holds the archwire to the bracket. The type of bracket and ligature used can affect the amount of friction between the archwire and the bracket, which can in turn affect the rate of tooth movement. Therefore, it is possible that the bracket-ligature combination could affect the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
