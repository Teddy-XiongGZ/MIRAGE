    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex, also known as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement. It is primarily driven by the semicircular canals of the inner ear, which detect rotational movements of the head. The otolith organs, on the other hand, detect linear accelerations and changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. While the otolith organs and the semicircular canals are part of the same vestibular system and work together to maintain balance and spatial orientation, the VOR is specifically driven by the semicircular canals. Therefore, the horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex is not directly influenced by otolith organs input.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
