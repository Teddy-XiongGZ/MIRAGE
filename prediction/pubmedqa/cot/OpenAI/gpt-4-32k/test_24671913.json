    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The SYNTAX score is a grading system that is used to determine the complexity of coronary artery disease. It is based on the coronary angiogram and takes into account the number and location of blockages, as well as the difficulty of treating them. Studies have shown that a higher SYNTAX score is associated with worse outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, including those with ST elevation myocardial infarction. Therefore, the SYNTAX score can indeed predict in-hospital outcomes in these patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
