    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion device is a device used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation who cannot take anticoagulants. It works by sealing off the LAA where blood clots commonly form in patients with atrial fibrillation.

However, it may not necessarily alter the electrocardiogram parameters as it does not directly affect the electrical activity of the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
