    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Landolt C and Snellen E are both visual acuity tests. Landolt C is often used in research settings and is considered more accurate, while Snellen E is more commonly used in clinical settings. Strabismus amblyopia is a condition where the eye does not focus properly due to misalignment, leading to decreased vision in the affected eye. The difference in these tests could potentially lead to different results in diagnosing or assessing the severity of strabismus amblyopia. Therefore, there could be differences in strabismus amblyopia when using Landolt C and Snellen E acuity tests.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
