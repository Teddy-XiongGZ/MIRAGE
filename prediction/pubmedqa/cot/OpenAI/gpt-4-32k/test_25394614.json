    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Surfactant is a substance that is naturally produced in the lungs to help maintain the structure of the air sacs in the lungs. Premature infants often lack this substance, which can lead to respiratory distress syndrome. Early surfactant therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, and mortality in preterm infants. Therefore, the timing of initial surfactant treatment does make a difference in rates of chronic lung disease or mortality in premature infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
