    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, it's important to understand what a Bare-Metal Stent is. It's a type of stent that's used in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, a non-surgical procedure used to treat the stenotic (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart. The stent helps keep the artery open after the procedure. However, these stents can sometimes cause complications, such as blood clots or restenosis. Patients with a high bleeding risk might be more susceptible to these complications. Therefore, the use of Bare-Metal Stent in these patients should be carefully considered. However, this is a complex issue that depends on many factors, including the specific patient's condition, the skill and experience of the medical team, and the availability of other treatment options. Therefore, it's not possible to give a definitive yes or no answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
