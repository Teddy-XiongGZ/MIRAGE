    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Isoproterenol is a medication that is used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate), heart block, and rarely for asthma. It works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airways and heart, thereby increasing heart rate and improving the blood flow. However, the question is asking about its effect on aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. Aortic stiffness is a condition where the aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the heart to the rest of the body, becomes less flexible. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including hypertension. However, there is no direct evidence or studies that suggest acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affect aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the answer would be maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
