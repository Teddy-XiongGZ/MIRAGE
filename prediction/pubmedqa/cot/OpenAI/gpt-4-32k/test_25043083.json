    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the key ligaments that help stabilize the knee joint. The posterior tibial slope refers to the angle of the tibia in relation to the ground. A steep posterior tibial slope can increase the strain on the ACL, which can potentially lead to a higher risk of ACL injuries. Therefore, it is plausible that a steep posterior tibial slope could be associated with failures of ACL reconstruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
