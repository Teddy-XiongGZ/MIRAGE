    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that is used to visualize the structure and function of the body. It is commonly used to diagnose a variety of medical conditions, including disc problems in the spine. However, while MRI can show structural abnormalities, it cannot predict the patient's subjective experience of pain, which can be influenced by many factors beyond the physical state of the disc. Therefore, it cannot accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
