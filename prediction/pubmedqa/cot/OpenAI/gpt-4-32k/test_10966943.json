    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amblyopia, also known as 'lazy eye', is a vision development disorder in which an eye fails to achieve normal visual acuity, even with prescription eyewear or contact lenses. It typically begins during infancy and early childhood. In most cases, only one eye is affected, but in some cases, amblyopia can occur in both eyes. If detected early and treated appropriately, the visual loss can often be reversed. However, if left untreated, it can lead to permanent visual loss. Therefore, the permanence of visual loss in amblyopia is not absolute and depends on early detection and treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
