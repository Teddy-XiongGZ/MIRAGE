    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epidural analgesia is a technique used to provide pain relief during and after surgery. It involves the injection of an anesthetic into the epidural space of the spine. While it is generally considered safe, it does carry some risks, like any medical procedure. These risks include infection, bleeding, and nerve damage. However, these risks are relatively low. In the context of surgical treatment for peritoneal carcinomatosis, the benefits of pain relief and improved postoperative recovery may outweigh these risks. Therefore, it would not be accurate to categorize it as a 'risky' technique without considering the individual patient's condition and the potential benefits.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
