    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a type of MRI that measures the random motion of water molecules within a voxel of tissue. It is often used in the detection and characterization of lesions in the liver. However, it primarily provides information about the cellularity and the integrity of the cellular membrane, not about the vascularization of the lesion. Vascularization refers to the formation of new blood vessels, which is typically assessed using contrast-enhanced imaging techniques, not DWI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
