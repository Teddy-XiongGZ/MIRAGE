    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antral follicle count (AFC) is a tool used in fertility treatment to predict the ovarian response. It is a good predictor of how many eggs can be retrieved during an IVF cycle. However, age and FSH levels are also important factors in predicting IVF outcomes. Age is the most important factor in female fertility, with fertility naturally declining as a woman gets older. FSH levels are also important as they can indicate the quantity and quality of a woman's remaining eggs. Therefore, while AFC is a useful tool, it is not necessarily a better predictor than age and FSH levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
