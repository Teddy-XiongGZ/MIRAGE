    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells could be a potential therapeutic target. c-Kit is a type of protein that can be found on the surface of certain types of cells where it plays a role in sending signals for cell growth and survival. If uveal melanoma cells are dependent on c-Kit for growth, then it could be possible to target this protein in order to inhibit the growth of the cancer cells. Therefore, it could potentially be a therapeutic target.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
