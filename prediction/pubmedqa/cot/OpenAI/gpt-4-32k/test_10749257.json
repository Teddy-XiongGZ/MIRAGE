    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) was enacted by the U.S. Congress to regulate the quality of care in mammography. It sets national standards for mammography facilities, equipment, personnel and reporting. Since North Carolina is part of the U.S., it is subject to these regulations. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the MQSA has affected the quality of mammography in North Carolina. However, without specific data or studies, it's impossible to definitively say how much or in what ways the quality has been affected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
