    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intraoperative precursor events refer to any complications or unexpected occurrences during a surgical procedure. These events can include things like unexpected bleeding, equipment failure, or patient instability. Postoperative major adverse events refer to serious complications that occur after the surgery, such as infection, organ failure, or even death. There is a logical connection between these two, as complications during surgery can lead to complications after surgery. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that intraoperative precursor events are associated with postoperative major adverse events.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
