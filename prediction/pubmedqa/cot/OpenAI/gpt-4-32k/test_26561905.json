It uses technology to connect patients with oncologists, allowing for consultations, treatment planning, and follow-up care. This can include the administration of chemotherapy. However, the safety of delivering chemotherapy through teleoncology models depends on several factors, including the availability of trained healthcare professionals in the rural area, the patient's overall health status, and the specific type of chemotherapy being administered.
