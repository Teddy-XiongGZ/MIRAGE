    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, it's important to understand what the question is asking. ADRs refer to adverse drug reactions, and the question is asking if decisional algorithms can replace global introspection in assessing the individual causality of these reactions. Global introspection refers to a comprehensive, subjective analysis, often conducted by a human. On the other hand, decisional algorithms are objective and based on predefined rules. While decisional algorithms can certainly aid in the process by providing objective data and analysis, they may not be able to fully capture the nuances and complexities that a human can through global introspection. Therefore, while they can be a valuable tool, they cannot fully replace global introspection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
