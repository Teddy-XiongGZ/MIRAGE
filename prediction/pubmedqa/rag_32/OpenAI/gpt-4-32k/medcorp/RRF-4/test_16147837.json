    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents present conflicting views on whether grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes. Some documents, such as Document [1], Document [2], Document [3], Document [6], Document [10], Document [19], Document [23], Document [26], Document [30], and Document [31], suggest that grandmultiparity is associated with higher risks of various complications, suggesting it could be an independent risk factor. However, other documents, such as Document [0], Document [4], Document [7], Document [8], Document [11], Document [14], Document [17], Document [22], and Document [24], argue that grandmultiparity does not appear to be an independent risk factor, especially in settings with good perinatal care. Therefore, the answer is not definitively 'yes' or 'no', but rather 'maybe', as it seems to depend on various factors including the quality of perinatal care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
