    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning. Document [1] also supports this, stating that a unit-based discharge coordinator can play an important part in enhancing the overall discharge experience for the patient and families. Document [2] also found that a discharge coordinator role resulted in more discharges before noon, decreased length of stay, and prepared families for self-care at home. Document [3] also found several advantages to using a dedicated RT-discharge-coordinator system for home-discharge preparation of respiratory-technology-dependent children. Document [4] also found that a multidisciplinary discharge coordination team decreased length of stay in their delayed discharge patient population. Therefore, the evidence overwhelmingly supports that a dedicated discharge coordinator does improve the quality of hospital discharge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
