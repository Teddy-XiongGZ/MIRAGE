    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] clearly states that the risk of secondary breast cancer after radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease is greater among women who underwent radiotherapy around the time of pregnancy. This is supported by the fact that the increase in the overall incidence and the actuarial rate of breast cancer among the women in the pregnant group was statistically significant. The women treated around the time of pregnancy had a higher actuarial rate of breast cancer. In the multivariate analysis, pregnancy around the time of radiotherapy was the only variable associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This suggests that pregnancy is a time of increased sensitivity of breast tissue to the carcinogenic effects of radiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
