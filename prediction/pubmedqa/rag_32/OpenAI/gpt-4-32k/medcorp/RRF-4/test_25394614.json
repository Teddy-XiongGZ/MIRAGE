    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against chronic lung disease/mortality among premature infants. Document [2] suggests that early selective surfactant administration given to infants with RDS requiring assisted ventilation leads to a decreased risk of acute pulmonary injury and a decreased risk of neonatal mortality and chronic lung disease compared to delaying treatment of such infants until they develop established RDS. Document [29] also supports the idea that early surfactant administration decreases the risks of BPD, of death or BPD, and of CPAP failure compared to strategies where surfactant is administered through an endotracheal tube. Therefore, the timing of initial surfactant treatment does make a difference in rates of chronic lung disease or mortality in premature infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
