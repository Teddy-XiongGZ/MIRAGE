    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [12] suggests that a higher plasma viscosity in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on >15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration. Document [19] suggests that the CRP initial response to the corticosteroid treatment is a prognostic factor in patients with PMR. Document [20] suggests that higher CRP values at 6 months appear to be associated with a higher risk of longer steroid therapy. Document [28] suggests that patients diagnosed with PMR at a younger age have a lower risk of relapse, but similar long-term outcomes with regards to continued need for treatment. These documents suggest that certain factors at disease onset can help predict the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
