    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that temperature is a crucial factor in kidney allograft preservation. It is generally considered that kidney grafts should be preserved at 4 degrees C during cold storage. However, the temperature levels during preservation can vary and influence the quality of the graft. For instance, the document [0] suggests that the new storage can affords more stable temperature levels when compared to the formerly used can. Since temperature is stable during conservation, continuous monitoring in everyday practice does not seem warranted. This suggests that while temperature is important in the preservation process, continuous monitoring may not be necessary if the storage conditions are stable. Therefore, the answer would be 'no', temperature should not be monitorized during kidney allograft preservation if the storage conditions are stable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
