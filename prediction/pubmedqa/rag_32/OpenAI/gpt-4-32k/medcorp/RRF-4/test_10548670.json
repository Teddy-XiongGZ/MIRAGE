    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used to measure neurological deficit in stroke patients. According to the documents, the NIHSS awards more points for tests of presumed left-hemisphere function, such as language, than for tests of right-hemisphere function, such as neglect. This means that patients with left hemisphere strokes may have higher NIHSS scores than those with right hemisphere strokes of similar volume. This is supported by multiple documents, including Document [0], which found that the volume of right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for left hemisphere strokes for patients with similar NIHSS scores. Document [1] also found that items of the NIHSS function differently in the right- and left-hemisphere lesion groups. Document [5] also supports this, stating that the NIHSS places more value on deficits in the left hemisphere, resulting in lesions receiving a higher score when occurring in the left hemisphere, compared to lesions of equal size in the right hemisphere. Therefore, it can be concluded that the NIHSS does favor left hemisphere strokes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
