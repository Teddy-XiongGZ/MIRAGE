    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether the regional wall motion of the left ventricle changes after the resection of fibrous tissue in endomyocardial fibrosis. Document [0] directly addresses this question. It states that left ventricular wall motion in the five regions did not differ between pre- and postoperative measurements. This suggests that the regional wall motion does not change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
