    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals. Document [1] also suggests that there is significantly diminished utilization of eye care services relative to recommended guidelines for a low-income, predominately minority sample of residents from public housing communities. Document [2] also mentions substantial inequity in access to eye care in the United States. Document [3] also mentions marked disparities occur in eye care utilization among Canadians without known eye diseases. Document [12] suggests that providing adult vision benefits was associated with having at least one past-year eye doctor visit among low-income children, and may help to reduce income-based disparities in children's receipt of vision care. However, the overall evidence suggests that while government assistance may provide some support, it does not necessarily improve the utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals to the extent that it eliminates disparities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
