    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the association between familial drinking and offspring drinking in young adulthood exhibits clear non-linear trends. Document [4] supports this by stating that there is a positive association between the drinking level of parents and their adult offspring. Document [10] also suggests that aggregation of alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence in families of male probands is significantly influenced by parental transmission of risk. Document [12] suggests that the developmental period in which parents' recovery occurs is a useful way to categorize 'recovered' AUDs versus current AUDs.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the familial transmission of drinking patterns does persist into young adulthood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
