    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking whether nurses are better at predicting hospital admission at the triage stage than a simple objective score. To answer this, I need to look at the documents and see what they say about the predictive abilities of nurses and objective scores. Document [1] directly addresses this question and suggests that a simple clinical score (GAPS) is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome. Document [2] also suggests that clinical judgement of the triage nurses was significantly better than the scores. Document [3] suggests that predicting admission at triage is not sufficiently accurate to inform hospital in-patient bed management systems. Document [5] suggests that the ability to predict admissions at triage by nurses was not adequate to support a change in the bed procurement process. Document [8] suggests that the triage nurse demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity in admission prediction at triage. Document [15] suggests that the nurses' triage decisions should not be used to determine the timeliness of access to emergency care. Document [16] suggests that the GAPS is a significantly better predictor of need for hospital admission than Ambs in an unselected ED population. Document [17] suggests that the accuracy of regression models to predict ED patient admission likelihood was shown to be generalizable across hospitals of different sizes, populations, and administrative structures. Document [18] suggests that the use of a short questionnaire by patients to self-triage showed limited accuracy, but sensitivity was high for some serious medical conditions. Document [22] suggests that the ability of PHPs to assign triage scores, predict clinical course and predict disposition from the ED have mild concordance with clinical assessment by ED staff. Document [24] suggests that the TN is the most accurate predictor of need to admit. Document [26] suggests that the accuracy of the triage nurses' prediction for disposition of patients is the same as that afforded by a model constructed from these characteristics. Document [27] suggests that the accuracy of regression models to predict ED patient admission likelihood was shown to be generalizable across hospitals of different sizes, populations, and administrative structures. Document [28] suggests that a model for predicting the risk of immediate hospital admission at triage for all-cause ED patients was developed and validated using routinely collected hospital data. Document [29] suggests that the accuracy of the triage nurses' prediction for disposition of patients is the same as that afforded by a model constructed from these characteristics. Document [30] suggests that the accuracy of regression models to predict ED patient admission likelihood was shown to be generalizable across hospitals of different sizes, populations, and administrative structures. Document [31] suggests that none of the scores had good accuracy in prediction of en-route complications during IFT. MEWS at triage was among the best one already but was not ideal. Based on these documents, it seems that the answer is not clear cut. Some documents suggest that nurses are better at predicting admission, while others suggest that objective scores are better. Therefore, the answer is maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
