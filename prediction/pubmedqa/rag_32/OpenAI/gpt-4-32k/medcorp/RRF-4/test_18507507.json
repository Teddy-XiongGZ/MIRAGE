    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Specialty pharmaceuticals are high-cost drugs used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions. They are often biologics and require special handling, administration, and patient education. The cost of these drugs is a significant concern for healthcare systems and patients. However, these drugs also offer significant benefits, such as increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, and reduced healthcare spending in the long run. They are particularly valuable for treating diseases that have few other effective treatment options. Therefore, the value of these drugs can be seen as high, despite their high cost. However, the cost-effectiveness of these drugs can vary, and in some cases, the cost may outweigh the benefits. Therefore, the answer to whether they are worth the price can be subjective and depend on various factors, including the specific drug and the patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
