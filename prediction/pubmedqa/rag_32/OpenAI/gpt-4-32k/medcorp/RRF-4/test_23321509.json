    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer can be beneficial in selected cases. For instance, Document 1 mentions that quaternary cytoreduction in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer appears to be a safe procedure and may bring survival benefit in selected cases. Document 2 also suggests that selected ovarian cancer patients who develop a secondary and tertiary recurrence may benefit from additional cytoreductive attempts. Document 5 also supports this, stating that in carefully selected patients, quaternary cytoreduction may be associated with acceptable morbidity and a relatively robust disease-specific survival. Therefore, the surgical effort in quaternary cytoreductive surgery still matters as it can potentially improve survival rates in selected patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
