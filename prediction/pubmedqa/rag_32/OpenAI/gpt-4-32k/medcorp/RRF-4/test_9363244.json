    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the impact of occupational nuclear power plant radiation on conception and pregnancy. Some documents suggest that there is no significant correlation between radiation exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., Document [1], Document [3], Document [7], Document [26]). However, other documents indicate potential risks, such as temporary sterility (Document [0]), increased risk of fetal death (Document [1]), and chromosomal damage (Document [11], Document [22]). Therefore, while the evidence is not entirely conclusive, there are indications that occupational nuclear power plant radiation could potentially affect conception and pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
