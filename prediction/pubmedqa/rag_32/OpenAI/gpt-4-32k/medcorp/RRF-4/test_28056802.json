    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that non-HDL-cholesterol may be a better predictor of long-term outcomes in patients after acute myocardial infarction compared to LDL-cholesterol. For instance, Document [0] states that non-HDL-C may be a more suitable target of dyslipidemia treatment than LDL-C in patients after AMI. Document [1] also suggests that non-HDL-C can predict long-term cardiovascular events in patients with CHD who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Document [4] suggests that non-HDL-C is a strong and independent predictor of nonfatal myocardial infarction and angina pectoris at 5 years, even after consideration of powerful clinical variables. Document [6] shows that non-HDL-C has been shown in their population as a prognostic factor of non-fatal cardiovascular disease, but not LDL-C. Document [16] suggests that among conventional lipid and non-lipid risk factors non-HDL cholesterol is the best discriminator to predict the presence of MI in individuals under the age of 36 years. Document [19] suggests that non-HDL cholesterol and TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios have predictive value for residual risk of AMI/sudden death. Document [25] suggests that non-HDL cholesterol and TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios have predictive value for residual risk of AMI/sudden death. Document [27] suggests that non-HDL cholesterol and TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios have predictive value for residual risk of AMI/sudden death. Document [30] suggests that non-HDL cholesterol and TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios have predictive value for residual risk of AMI/sudden death.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
