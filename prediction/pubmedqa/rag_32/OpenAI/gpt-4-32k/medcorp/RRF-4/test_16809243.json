    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy. Document [1] also concludes that fetal gender is unlikely to affect maternal asthma during pregnancy to the point where acute care and medications are more often required among women pregnant with a female fetus. Document [2] suggests that pregnant asthmatic women carrying a girl might be more susceptible to asthma exacerbations, but this does not directly relate to emergency department visits. Document [22] also suggests that carrying a female fetus is associated with worse maternal asthma, as assessed by greater airway lability, than is carrying a male fetus. However, this does not directly relate to emergency department visits. Therefore, based on the documents, the answer is no, fetal gender is not associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
