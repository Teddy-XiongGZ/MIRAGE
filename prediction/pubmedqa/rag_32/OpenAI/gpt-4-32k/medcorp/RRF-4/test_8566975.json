    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that there was no evidence of serovar specific immunity in their population. Document [2] also mentions that gonococcal infection did not induce evident immunity to reinfection with the same serovar. However, Document [4] suggests that infection with a specific gonococcal serovar results in specific but incomplete protection against subsequent infection with the homologous serovar. This indicates that there might be some level of serovar specific immunity, but it is not complete or consistent. Therefore, the answer is not a clear yes or no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
