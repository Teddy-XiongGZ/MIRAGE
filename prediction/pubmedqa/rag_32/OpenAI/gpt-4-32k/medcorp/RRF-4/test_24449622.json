    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that there is no linear correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness and serum PON 1. However, it also mentions that PON 1 level is lower in patients with epicardial fat tissue thickness 7 mm and over. Document 1 also mentions that PON-1 activity was negatively correlated with epicardial fat tissue. This suggests that while there may not be a direct linear correlation, there is some relationship between the two variables.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
