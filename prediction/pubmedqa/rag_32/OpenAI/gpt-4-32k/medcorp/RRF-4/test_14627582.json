    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate. Document [1] suggests that multiple reading is an effective way to reduce false-negative perception error, but it also decreases specificity. Therefore, the necessity of double reading of barium enemas seems to depend on the specific context and the balance between sensitivity and specificity that is desired. However, given that the primary document [0] suggests it does not improve sensitivity and increases false positives, it seems that it may not be necessary in most cases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
