    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a variety of perspectives on the treatment of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures. Some documents suggest that surgical treatment can lead to better functional outcomes, lower rates of nonunion and malunion, and earlier return to activity (Documents 11, 14, 22, 24, 26). However, it's also noted that surgical treatment can come with a higher rate of complications (Document 14). On the other hand, non-operative treatment is traditionally considered the standard of care for most of these fractures (Document 19, 26), and some studies suggest that it can lead to satisfactory outcomes as well (Document 12, 15). However, there's also evidence that non-operative treatment can lead to higher rates of nonunion, malunion, and dissatisfaction with appearance (Document 11). Given these mixed findings, it seems that the choice between surgical and non-operative treatment may depend on the specific characteristics of the fracture and the patient's individual needs and preferences.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
