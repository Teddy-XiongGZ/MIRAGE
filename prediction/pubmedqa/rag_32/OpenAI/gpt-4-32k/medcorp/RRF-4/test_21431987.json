    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the utility of PET/CT in preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. Some documents suggest that PET/CT provides additional useful information and can change the therapeutic strategy in some cases (e.g., Document 3, Document 4, Document 12, Document 14, Document 23, Document 27, Document 29). However, other documents suggest that PET/CT has a limited role and its results can be hampered by low positive predictive value (e.g., Document 0, Document 26). Furthermore, some documents suggest that MRI might be the most appropriate imaging modality in this context (e.g., Document 30, Document 31). Therefore, the answer is not clear-cut and depends on the specific context and patient characteristics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
