    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that there is a correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS. This suggests that trabecular bone properties could influence primary stability. Document 1 also mentions that bone quality, which could be related to trabecular bone properties, is a factor in primary stability. Document 2 also mentions that bone characteristics play a major role in miniscrews primary stability. Therefore, it can be concluded that trabecular bone is related to primary stability of miniscrews.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
