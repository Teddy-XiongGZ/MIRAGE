    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward was associated with a longer total hospital length of stay for patients aged over 75 with fracture of the proximal femur. However, it does not mention any other outcomes. Document [1] suggests that if medical conditions are adequately treated before operative fixation of fractures of the proximal femur in elderly patients, the short-term outcome is not adversely affected. Document [2] suggests that the prediction of a higher hospital mortality rate and a delay in reaching independent mobility in more dependent patients with both scores reached statistical significance. Document [3] suggests that factors are described which will alert clinicians to people likely to have a long length of stay and may need formal rehabilitation. Document [4] suggests that transfer time and time at the initial hospital were not associated with mortality, complication rate, or time to femur fixation. Document [5] suggests that surgeons who regularly transferred patients to designated rehabilitation units were more satisfied than those whose patient care took place in the environment of the acute orthopaedic ward. Document [6] suggests that significantly fewer treatment patients were discharged to institutional care and more to their own homes. Document [7] suggests that patients with proximal femoral fracture derive no benefit from acute hospital admission of more than 8 days and the majority acquire nosocomial infection after this. Document [8] suggests that medically fit elderly patients presenting with proximal femoral fracture have improved survival with early surgery within 24 hours of admission. Document [9] suggests that accelerated rehabilitation led to a substantial reduction in length of hospital stay with a modest short-term improvement in level of physical independence and accommodation status after discharge. Document [10] suggests that the mortality in distal femur group was higher at all times when compared to that in the proximal femur group. Document [11] suggests that consideration of the ADL score, age and mental state at the time of admission to hospital is all that is needed to determine return to the community. Document [12] suggests that the most important predictors of the change in the discharge destination were the medical condition, cognitive and physical function of the patient at admission. Document [13] suggests that the actuarial survival rate at one year was 64.7% and at five years was 35.3%. Document [14] suggests that the trials reviewed had different aims, interventions and outcomes. Document [15] suggests that identifying those at risk of being discharged to an alternative location following admission from home on the basis of identified preoperative indices could assist in streamlining the postoperative care phase. Document [16] suggests that the mean mortality rate was 18.2% in the early timing and 23.2% in the delayed timing. Document [17] suggests that the efficient management of patients with DRG 210/211 requires a strong protocol of treatment and referral strategies with adequate resources. Document [18] suggests that modern surgical techniques permit early mobilisation and possible changes in surgical procedures will probably not essentially influence the outcome of rehabilitation. Document [19] suggests that cognitive function, nutritional status, preinjury functional level, and depression were the most important prognostic factors associated with rehabilitation success of older patients with proximal hip fracture. Document [20] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [21] suggests that early surgery in femur fracture became a priority in health systems, but early postoperative physiotherapy also plays a major role in prevention of mortality. Document [22] suggests that early surgery and early ambulation decrease mortality. Document [23] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [24] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [25] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [26] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [27] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [28] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [29] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [30] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Document [31] suggests that early surgery and walking ability at 10 days after trauma were independently and significantly associated with mortality at 6 months and at 1 year. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that a delay in transfer to a rehabilitation unit for older people does affect outcome after fracture of the proximal femur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
