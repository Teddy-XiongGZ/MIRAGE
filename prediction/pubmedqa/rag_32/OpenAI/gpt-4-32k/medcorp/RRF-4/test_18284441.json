    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The c-kit protooncogen is a protein that plays a key role in cell growth and differentiation. According to Document [0], c-kit expression was observed in 62 of 75 HCC tissue specimens (82%) (p < 0.001). C-kit positivity was observed in the mitotic, proliferating and also dysplastic hepatic cells. These results suggest that c-kit expression may be used as an early diagnostic indicator for HBV induced HCC. Document [1] also supports this, stating that c-kit expression was detected immunohistochemically in 70% of HCC with different degrees of intensity. Moreover, c-kit expression could also be found in about 90% of the corresponding peritumoral noncirrhotic as well as in cirrhotic liver tissues. However, Document [4] suggests that CD117 (another name for c-kit) is not significantly overexpressed in HCC and there seems to be no role for the use of imatinib. This suggests that while c-kit may be expressed in HCC, it may not be a reliable diagnostic marker. Therefore, the answer is maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
