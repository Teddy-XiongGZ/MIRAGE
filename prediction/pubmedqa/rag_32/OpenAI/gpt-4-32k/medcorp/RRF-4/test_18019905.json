    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether the use of audit to identify maternal mortality is just a difference between the rich and the poor. From the documents, it is clear that audits are used in both high-income and low-income countries to identify causes and contributing factors to maternal deaths. However, the causes of deaths and the solutions to reduce maternal mortality vary greatly between these settings. For example, in high-income countries like the Netherlands, the main cause of maternal death is (pre-)eclampsia, while in low-income countries like Zambia and The Gambia, the main causes are HIV/AIDS, sepsis, and obstructed labour. Therefore, the use of audit is not just a difference between the rich and the poor, but a tool used in both settings to identify problems and promote solutions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
