    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that kidney damage occurs during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy when warm ischemia is over 30 minutes. This damage is only partially reversible and efforts should be made to keep warm ischemia within 30 minutes. Document 1 also states that if the warm ischemia time is greater than 28 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, the functional damage to the affected kidney progresses even up to 1 year after surgery. Document 3 suggests that patients with warm ischemia time greater than 40 minutes had a significantly greater decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and a lower glomerular filtration rate postoperatively. Document 4 suggests that eGFR loss in the LPN group was significantly higher in patients that experienced over 30 minutes of ischemia time. Document 13 suggests that every minute counts when the renal hilum is clamped. Document 26 suggests that warm ischemia time was 35 minutes in the open group compared to 28 minutes in the robotic group. Document 29 suggests that warm ischemia time was 33.8 minutes. These documents suggest that renal warm ischemia over 30 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is possible, but it may lead to kidney damage and decreased renal function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
