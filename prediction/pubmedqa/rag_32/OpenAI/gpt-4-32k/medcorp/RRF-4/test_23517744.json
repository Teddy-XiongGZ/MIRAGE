    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that a solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence. However, Document [1] states that ischemia-reperfusion injury can be detrimental to the solitary kidney. Document [2] suggests that renal ischemia has been considered for a long time as the main factor related with postoperative Renal Function (RF) in patients with NSS. Document [3] suggests that renal function following PN in a solitary kidney seems to depend on non-reversible factors such as pre-operative glomerular filtration rate. Document [4] suggests that vascular clamping during open nephron sparing surgery is associated with a higher incidence of renal complications. Document [7] suggests that in spite of compensatory hypertrophy of the solitary kidney, no improvement in its tolerance to ischemia was observed. Document [8] suggests that long-term renal function after partial nephrectomy is determined primarily by the quantity and quality of renal parenchyma preserved, although type and duration of ischemia remain the most important modifiable factors. Document [9] suggests that warm ischemia during PN is associated with adverse renal consequences. Document [14] suggests that the solitary kidney (SK) is of special interest for practitioners because of the reduced number of nephrons as compared to persons who have 2 kidneys. Document [16] suggests that our understanding of the potential impact of ischemia time on renal function during nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is based on decades of low-quality evidence. Document [18] suggests that ischemia preconditioning (IPC) does not confer resilience to subsequent renal warm ischemia (WI) in a single-kidney porcine model. Document [22] suggests that acute kidney injury after partial nephrectomy was not a significant or independent predictor of long-term functional decline in our institutional cohort. Document [26] suggests that ischemia preconditioning (IPC) does not confer resilience to subsequent renal warm ischemia (WI) in a single-kidney porcine model. Document [27] suggests that a functionally solitary kidney may be the consequence of renal agenesis, dysplasia, or surgical procedures. Compensatory hypertrophy and physiologic mechanisms intervene to preserve renal function. Document [31] suggests that the pars recta of the proximal tubule of the rat kidney was examined by means of light and electron microscopy after 15, 30, 60 and 120 min of ischemia produced by clamping of the aorta. Also the effects of 24 hrs of blood reflow following the same ischemia periods were determined. The maximal changes occurring after ischemic periods of up to 60 min included: marked cell swelling, swelling of the inner compartments of the mitochondria, swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum and of microvilli, pronounced chromatin clumping in the nuclei and distortion of the Golgi apparatus. These cell changes were reported to be reversible in the previous paper of this series. After 24 hrs of blood reflow it was found that with increasing periods of primary ischemia, ranging from 15 to 120 min, an increasing number of pars recta tubules cells were undergoing necrosis. Theses findings indicate that some additional mechanism other than the initial ischemia per se must be responsible for the progressive cellular damage leading to the necrosis. This is in contrast to the pars convoluta of the proximal tubule, which does not undergo further degenerative changes after the primary ischemia has been ended. The 'no reflow' phenomenon may satisfactorily explain the necrosis seen in the pars recta segments following various periods of ischemia after 24 hrs of arterial renal reflow. Based on these documents, it seems that the solitary kidney is not necessarily more resistant to ischemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
