    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] provides a clear answer to the question. It states that the slit-lamp biomicroscopy-based method (SLBM) can be used for measuring pupil diameter, including mesopic pupil size. However, it also mentions that SLBM tends to underestimate mesopic pupil size and shows a wide range of agreement with Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP). Therefore, while it is technically possible to measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method, the accuracy might be compromised.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
