    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] clearly states that precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. Document [0] also supports this by stating that precursor events occurred more frequently in cases with a DNM outcome than in those with no adverse event. Document [2] also mentions that a wide range of problematic precursor events occurs during the majority of cardiac surgery procedures. Document [10] also supports this by stating that in neonatal and infant open heart repairs, technical performance score is one of the main predictors of postoperative morbidity. Therefore, the answer is yes, intraoperative precursor events are associated with postoperative major adverse events.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
