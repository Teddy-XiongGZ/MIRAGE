    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that DaTSCAN is useful in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. However, the results do not support a direct link between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. While some patients with essential tremor may show a small degree of striatal dopaminergic degeneration, this does not necessarily mean they will progress to Parkinson's disease. Therefore, while DaTSCAN can help distinguish between the two conditions, it does not establish a correlation between them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
