    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what cavitation in proximal surfaces means. Cavitation refers to the formation of cavities or holes, in this case, in the teeth. Proximal surfaces are the surfaces of a tooth that are adjacent to the next tooth. Now, I need to review the documents to see if there is any information about whether cavitation in proximal surfaces should be reported in a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examination. Document [0] states that a clinical study found that CBCT was more accurate in detecting cavitation in proximal surfaces than bitewing radiographs. Therefore, if a CBCT examination is performed, it should also be assessed for proximal surface cavities in teeth without restorations, and when detected, this pathology must be part of the dentist's report. This suggests that the answer is yes, cavitation in proximal surfaces should be reported in a CBCT examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
