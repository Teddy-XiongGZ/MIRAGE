    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that folic acid supplementation is often given alongside methotrexate therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This is because some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be related to its action as an anti-folate, and folic acid can help to reduce these side effects. However, there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate. Despite this, several documents suggest that it is important to continue folic acid supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate to prevent them from discontinuing treatment due to side effects such as mouth ulcers, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, it seems that patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily do need to continue folic acid supplements long term.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
