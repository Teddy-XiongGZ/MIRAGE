The authors found that episodes were consistent (all manic or all mixed) in significantly more patients than would be expected by chance. Document [0] also supports this, stating that manic and mixed episodes tend to recur true to type. Document [18] also suggests that there is potential for a new typology of clinical course based on medium-term naturalistic follow-up of a representative clinical sample of patients with bipolar disorder, which could further support the idea that the manic/mixed episode distinction runs true over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
