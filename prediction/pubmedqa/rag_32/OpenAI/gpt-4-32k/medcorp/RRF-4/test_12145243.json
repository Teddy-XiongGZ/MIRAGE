    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that individuals with lower initial glycemia, who may be earlier in the course of their disease, had fewer adverse clinical outcomes despite similar glycemic progression. This suggests that lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis could be associated with improved outcomes. However, it's important to note that the document also mentions that active case detection programs would be required to identify these individuals, as most are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Therefore, while the evidence suggests a positive correlation, it does not definitively prove that lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis will always lead to improved outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
