    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that octogenarians are not necessarily at a higher risk for carotid endarterectomy. Several studies indicate that age alone should not be a determining factor for the risk associated with this procedure. While some studies suggest that there may be slightly higher rates of certain complications in octogenarians, these differences are not statistically significant in most cases. Furthermore, many studies emphasize that the outcomes of carotid endarterectomy in octogenarians are comparable to those in younger patients, suggesting that age should not be a prohibitive factor for this procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
