    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents present mixed views on the necessity of adjuvant radiation for stage III thymoma. Some studies suggest that adjuvant radiation does not significantly alter recurrence rates or improve survival rates in patients with stage III thymoma (e.g., Document 0, Document 1, Document 2, Document 6, Document 16, Document 22, Document 30). However, other studies suggest that adjuvant radiation may improve disease-specific survival (e.g., Document 4, Document 8, Document 23, Document 27) or overall survival (e.g., Document 11, Document 18, Document 23, Document 27) in these patients. Given these conflicting findings, it is not clear whether adjuvant radiation is necessary for all patients with stage III thymoma. The decision may depend on individual patient characteristics and other factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
