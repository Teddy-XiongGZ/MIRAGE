    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that biofeedback training can enhance athletes' sport performance. For instance, Document [0] shows that a greater number of participants in the experimental group were able to successfully control their psychophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peers in the control group. Document [1] suggests that biofeedback training may help to train stressed athletes to acquire a control over their psychophysiological processes, thus helping an athlete to perform maximally. Document [2] suggests that heart rate variability biofeedback is an effective, safe, and easy-to-learn and apply method for both athletes and coaches in order to improve sport performance. Document [3] supports HRV BFB as a potential intervention to improve fine and gross motor function in athletes. Document [9] concludes that neurofeedback and biofeedback interventions combined, can be used as an effective method to enhance athletic performance. Therefore, the answer is yes, biofeedback training of psychophysiological responses can enhance athletes' sport performance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
