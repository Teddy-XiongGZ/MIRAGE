    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents present a mixed view on the use of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy for necrotizing fasciitis. Some documents suggest that it can improve patient survival and decrease the number of debridements required, while others suggest that the results are inconsistent and more research is needed. There are also mentions of the therapy being used as an adjunctive treatment, not a substitute for surgical debridement. Given this, it seems that while hyperbaric oxygenation therapy may be beneficial in some cases, it is not universally recommended or proven to be effective for all cases of necrotizing fasciitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
