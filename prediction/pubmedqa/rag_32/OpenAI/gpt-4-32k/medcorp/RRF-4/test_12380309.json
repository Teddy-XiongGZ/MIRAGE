Some documents, such as Document [2], [7], [10], [20], and [30], suggest that circumcision in childhood can have health benefits, including the prevention of urinary tract infections, penile cancer, and sexually transmitted diseases. However, other documents, such as Document [0], [1], [3], [6], [11], [12], [16], [26], and [27], argue that circumcision in childhood can have risks and complications, and that it should not be performed without a medical reason or the informed consent of the individual.
