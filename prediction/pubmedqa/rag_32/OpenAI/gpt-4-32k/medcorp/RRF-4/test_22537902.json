    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether managing colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases at the same centre improves results. Document [1] directly addresses this question. It states that global management of colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at the same centre was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. Separate management was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of separate management patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection. Therefore, the answer is no, global management at the same centre does not necessarily improve results.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
