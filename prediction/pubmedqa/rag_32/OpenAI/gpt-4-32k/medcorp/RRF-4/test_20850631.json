    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that ultrasound can be a useful tool in diagnosing and following up on constipation in children. For instance, Document [0] found a positive correlation between rectal diameters and constipation, and that ultrasound helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria. Document [1] also found that ultrasound examination proved a reliable alternative to rectal examination or abdominal radiography when identifying fecal impaction. Document [2] suggests that pelvic ultrasound should be the first line investigation for all children with chronic idiopathic constipation. Document [4] found that pelvic ultrasound is useful in diagnosing and setting up the most appropriate treatment protocol for different chronic constipation cases. Document [10] found a strong correlation of an enlarged transrectal diameter with constipation, suggesting that point-of-care ultrasound is a useful adjunct for diagnosing constipation. Document [17] found that transabdominal rectal diameter measurement may be useful in the diagnosis of constipation. Therefore, the answer should be 'yes'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
