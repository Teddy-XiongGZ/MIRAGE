    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that ultrasound-obtained estimated fetal weight (US-EFW) is a risk factor for cesarean delivery (CD). For instance, Document [0] states that CD was significantly more common for women with US-EFW and that the risk increased when US-EFW was >3500 g. Document [1] also supports this, stating that fetal weight estimation (FWE) by ultrasound systematically performed proved to be an independent risk factor for cesarean delivery. Therefore, it can be inferred that estimated fetal weight by ultrasound is a modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
