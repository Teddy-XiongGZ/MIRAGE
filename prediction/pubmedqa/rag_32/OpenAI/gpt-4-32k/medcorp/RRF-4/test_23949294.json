    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] directly addresses the question and concludes that maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings is feasible. This is supported by Document [1] which discusses the importance of viral load monitoring among adolescents in resource-limited settings and suggests that it could prevent unnecessary switches to second-line therapy. Document [2] also supports this by reporting a successful delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a resource-limited setting, minimizing risk for non-adherence. Document [3] discusses a trial comparing point-of-care to standard-of-care viral load testing, suggesting that if this method of testing is acceptable and feasible, it could improve the achievement of the 90-90-90 goals in resource-limited settings. Document [25] also supports this by reporting high levels of virological suppression in a resource-limited setting in Ethiopia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
