    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether familiarizing surgeons with current evidence can lead to a change in their practice. Document [0] directly addresses this question, stating that a study showed that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons did not lead to a significant change in practice. This suggests that simply familiarizing surgeons with current evidence may not be sufficient to change their practice. Other documents, such as Document [1], Document [2], and Document [3], also suggest that changing surgical practice to align with evidence is a complex process that involves more than just familiarization with the evidence. Therefore, the answer to the question is no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
