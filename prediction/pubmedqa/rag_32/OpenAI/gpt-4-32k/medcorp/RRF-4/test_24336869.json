    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that ambulance data can be used to identify violence hotspots and offer unique information for violence prevention. For instance, Document [1] shows that ambulance and police data are highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, and that at least half of ambulance hotspots are unknown to the police, suggesting that data sharing could lead to reduced community violence. Document [0] also supports this, stating that ambulance data provide a unique source of information about the epidemiology of community violence and have the potential to improve current violent crime surveillance methods. Therefore, it can be concluded that routinely collected ambulance data about assaults can contribute to the reduction in community violence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
