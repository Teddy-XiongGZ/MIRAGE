    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that the risk factors for myocardial infarction do not confer equal risk in men and women. For instance, Document [0] states that the relative risk is higher in women for many risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, elevated triglycerides, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Document [1] also supports this, stating that smoking is a stronger risk factor for myocardial infarction in middle-aged women than in men. Document [2] suggests that women may be more sensitive than men to some of the harmful effects of smoking. Document [14] indicates that smoking, higher systolic blood pressure, and longer duration of diabetes had a greater relative and absolute effect in women than men. Therefore, the answer is no, these risk factors do not confer equal risk of myocardial infarction in women as in men.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
