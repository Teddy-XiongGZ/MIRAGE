    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through programmed cell death (PCD). The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The documents provided suggest that mitochondria play a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant. For example, Document [0] states that the role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals and it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. Document [3] also discusses that changes in mitochondrial morphology are an early and crucial step in plant cell death. Document [12] suggests that the mitochondria play a critical role in the cell death process. Changes in mitochondrial dynamics were visualized in heat shock-treated cells, including loss of mitochondrial mobility, reduction in \u0394\u03a8m, as well as the proximal association with chloroplasts. Document [25] also supports the role of mitochondria in PCD, stating that inhibition of auxin signaling disrupts several downstream features of the lace plant PCD signaling cascade and results in fewer or no perforations. Therefore, mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
