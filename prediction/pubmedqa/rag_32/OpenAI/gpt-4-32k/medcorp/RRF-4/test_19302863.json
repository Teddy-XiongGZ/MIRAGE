    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents present mixed results regarding the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis. Some studies, such as those in documents 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 26, 28, 30, and 31, suggest that cyanoacrylate can be a good and reliable alternative, showing benefits like shorter operation time, equal or higher strength compared to traditional sutures, and successful healing. However, other studies, like those in documents 0, 4, 5, 16, 22, and 29, indicate potential drawbacks, such as impeded healing, increased inflammatory reactions, lower bursting pressure, and more extensive adhesion formation. Therefore, while cyanoacrylate shows promise, its effectiveness and safety seem to depend on various factors, including the specific type of cyanoacrylate used, the method of application, and the specific surgical context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
