    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide multiple studies that show a correlation between fast food consumption and the prevalence of asthma. For instance, Document [0] shows a dose-dependent association between frequent consumption of hamburgers and asthma symptoms. Document [1] also shows a direct association between fast food consumption and the prevalence of asthma. Document [2] indicates that eating fast foods three or more times per week was a statistically significant risk factor for asthma. Document [3] suggests that maternal fast food intake during pregnancy increases offspring's risk for asthmatic symptoms. Document [4] shows an increased risk of severe asthma associated with the consumption of fast food. Document [5] concludes that the consumption of fast foods, particularly hamburgers, correlates to asthma in a dose-response pattern. Therefore, based on these studies, it can be concluded that fast foods are a risk factor for asthma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
