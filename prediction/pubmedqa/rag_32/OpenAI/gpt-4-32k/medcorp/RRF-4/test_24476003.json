    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the usefulness of nasogastric decompression in preventing leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Document [0] states that routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence. Document [1] does not provide clear information on the role of nasogastric decompression in preventing leaks. Document [3] suggests that routine prophylactic postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after elective gastrectomy. Document [5] also suggests that routine nasogastric decompression is not necessary in elective operations for gastric cancer. Document [13] suggests that routine nasogastric or nasojejunal decompression is unnecessary after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Document [14] suggests that routine nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Document [16] suggests that routine nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.
