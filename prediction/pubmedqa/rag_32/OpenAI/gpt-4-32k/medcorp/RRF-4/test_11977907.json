    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that a side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). The document also mentions that systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS. Document [10] also mentions a linear correlation between increasing arm blood pressure difference with the occurrence of symptoms. Therefore, it can be concluded that the blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of steal in subclavian steal syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
