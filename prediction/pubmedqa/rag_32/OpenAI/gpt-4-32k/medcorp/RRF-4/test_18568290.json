    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a vital role in hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis. It also mentions that altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during hemodialysis. Document 1 also supports the role of endothelin-1 in the pathogenesis of hypertension in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Document 2 suggests that endothelin may play a role as a mediator of chronic hypertension in pathophysiological states associated with endothelial dysfunction. Document 3 and 4 also suggest that endothelin-1 plays a role in hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis. Document 6 suggests that altered NO/ET-1 balance may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during dialysis. Document 14 suggests that functional vascular changes, likely related to an enhanced production of vasodilator agents, are responsible for chronic hypotension in hemodialysis patients. Document 18 suggests that endothelin-1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of the varied forms of hypertension. Document 20 suggests that endothelin-1 is now known to play a key physiological role in the maintenance both of basal systemic vascular resistance and of blood pressure in healthy people. Document 23 suggests that a transient intradialytic increase in plasma sodium did not affect indices of endothelial function or sympathetic activity compared with standard hemodialysis, but coincided with higher plasma vasopressin levels. Document 26 suggests that increased plasma endothelin-1 might be implicated in the pathogenesis of secondary pulmonary hypertension caused by rheumatic valvular disease. Document 27 suggests that low dialysate sodium concentrations significantly decreased systolic blood pressure and ameliorated intradialytic hypertension. Document 28 suggests that endothelin is an important modulator of renal function. Document 30 suggests that the renal ET(A) receptor plays a role in the pathophysiology of renal vasoconstriction associated with heart failure. Document 31 suggests that plasma endothelin level was higher in patients with chronic renal failure than in normals, regardless to dialysotherapy. It rose after dialysis. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that endothelin-1 does play a role in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
