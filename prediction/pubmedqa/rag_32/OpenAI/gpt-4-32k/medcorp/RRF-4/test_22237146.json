    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what the documents say about using serum to analyze EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Document [0] suggests that serum samples might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC. Document [1] also suggests that serum samples may be a convenient alternative for EGFR mutation analysis. Document [2] suggests that it is feasible to use serum to detect EGFR mutation, which can predict a benefit from EGFR-TKIs given as first-line therapy. Document [4] suggests that no EGFR mutation was found in the blood samples of advanced-stage NSCLC patients undergoing TKI-targeted therapy. Document [8] suggests that the detection of EGFR mutations in plasma or serum is a noninvasive method to confirm EGFR mutation status in patients with NSCLC. Document [15] suggests that the HRM assay can provide convincing and valuable results both for serum and tissues samples, thus, it is suitable for routine serum EGFR mutation screening for NSCLC patients, especially those surgically unresectable. Document [21] suggests that EGFR mutations were detectable using Scorpion Amplified Refractory Mutation System technology in serum DNA from patients with NSCLC. Document [25] suggests that the status of the serum EGFR ligand, in addition to EGFR activating mutation, is a predictive factor for response to gefitinib therapy. Document [30] suggests that classification of EGFR gene mutation status using the serum proteomic classifier established in the present study in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC is feasible and may predict tumor response to EGFR-TKIs. Based on these documents, it seems that serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
