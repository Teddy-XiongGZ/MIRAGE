    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents suggest that open access publishing increases the impact of scientific articles. For instance, Document [2] shows that open access articles received more citations and mentions than closed access articles. Document [15] also supports this, stating that open access articles tend to have greater scientific and social impact than non-open access articles. Document [10] also shows that open data has significantly increased the citations of journal articles.

Therefore, while there is strong evidence supporting that open access publishing increases the impact of scientific articles, there are also studies suggesting otherwise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
