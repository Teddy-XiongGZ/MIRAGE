    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians can be beneficial. Document [2] states that cardiac reoperations can be performed successfully in most octogenarians, with an increased risk, particularly in the combined CABG and valve group. Long-term survival is acceptable with improved quality of life and functional status. Document [4] also supports this, stating that octogenarians exhibit a similar long-term survival and quality of life after primary and redo cardiac surgery. Therefore, cardiac reoperation should not be a contraindication per se in octogenarians. Document [6] also supports this, stating that despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
