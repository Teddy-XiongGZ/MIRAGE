    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 suggests that breastfeeding has a protective effect against childhood illness, including atopy, in children with a family history of atopy. Document 1, however, suggests that breastfeeding did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy. Document 7 suggests that exclusive breastfeeding during the first 3 months of life is associated with lower incidence rates of atopic dermatitis during childhood in children with a family history of atopy. Document 12 also suggests that exclusive breastfeeding during the first months after birth is associated with lower asthma rates during childhood. Document 19 suggests that breastfeeding significantly decreased the risk of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and sensitization to furred pets, in children with atopic heredity, whereas in children without atopic heredity, breastfeeding was related to an increased risk of atopy. Document 21 suggests that breastfeeding is a protective factor for development of atopic dermatitis. Document 23 suggests that male sex, parental atopy, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are risk factors for asthma in young children, and children born in winter exhibit a greater prevalence of sensitization to cats and house dust mites. Document 26 suggests that breastfeeding is a protective factor for development of atopic dermatitis. Document 28 suggests that there is no association between infantile colic and subsequent development of asthma or atopy. Document 30 suggests that there is no association between infant feeding practices and subsequent development of asthma or allergic disease. Document 31 suggests that longer duration of breastfeeding and later introduction of solid foods did not prevent the onset of asthma, eczema or atopy by age 5 years. Overall, the evidence is mixed, with some studies suggesting a protective effect of breastfeeding against atopy in children with a family history of atopy, and others suggesting no effect or even an increased risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
