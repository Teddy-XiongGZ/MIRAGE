    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the association between plasma glucose levels and cardiovascular disease risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance. Document [1] also suggests that patients with diabetes and/or insulin resistance syndrome are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Document [2] further supports this by stating that insulin resistance appears to be the risk factor that best correlates with metabolic abnormalities prior to diagnosis and is fundamentally linked to the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Document [3] also provides compelling evidence that insulin resistance by itself is a cardiovascular risk factor. Therefore, it can be concluded that insulin resistance does drive the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
