    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what confined placental mosaicism (CPM) is. From the documents, I learned that CPM is a condition where some cells in the placenta have a different genetic makeup than the rest of the cells in the body. This can occur in both IVF and spontaneous pregnancies. Now, I need to determine if CPM is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies. Document [0] states that the incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions and probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI. Document [13] also supports this, stating that the prevalence of CPM in IVF and ICSI pregnancies is similar to that of the general population and was not observed in cases that were affected by small for gestational age. Therefore, based on these documents, it seems that CPM does not account for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
