    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old women and may also be a significant predictor for men. Document [1] supports this by stating that being optimistic at ages 85 and 90 is associated with improved survival. Document [2] also indicates that optimistic individuals were associated with lower odds of mortality. Document [13] provides evidence that optimism is a universal phenomenon and the associations between optimism and improved psychological functioning are not limited to industrialized nations. Document [18] suggests that higher total LOT-R and optimism were associated with reduced odds of CHD mortality. Document [29] also suggests that optimism was associated with reduced CHD mortality in older men and women. Document [31] suggests that both types of optimism were associated with having fewer HIV symptoms, but a more optimistic explanatory style was related to having poorer immune status. Therefore, the majority of the documents suggest that an optimistic outlook does predict better survival at advanced ages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
