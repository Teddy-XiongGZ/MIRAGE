    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that locally administered 1.0% ropivacaine significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and is a safe and effective method. Document 1 also supports this, stating that topical ropivacaine with ketamine can reduce immediate postoperative pain and analgesic requirement better than ropivacaine alone. Document 2 also mentions that ropivacaine infiltration is as effective as bupivacaine for post-tonsillectomy pain management in children. Document 3 also supports the use of ropivacaine, stating that preincisional injection of ropivacaine with clonidine prior to tonsillectomy has a preemptive analgesic effect that outlasts the local anesthetic and decreases pain, opioid use, and the time to return to normal activity. Therefore, the evidence suggests that topical ropivacaine does reduce post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
