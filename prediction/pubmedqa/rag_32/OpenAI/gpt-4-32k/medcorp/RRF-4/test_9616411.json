    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the total rate of admission to general hospitals was lower in municipalities with a GP hospital than in those without. This suggests that GP hospitals do reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds. Document [1] also suggests that GP beds represent a portion of all hospital beds, implying that they are being utilised and potentially reducing the need for general hospital beds. Document [2] also supports this, stating that the rate of use of general medical and geriatric beds in district general hospitals was about half that of populations without access to community hospitals. Document [3] also found that practices with access to GP beds used fewer hospital bed days. Document [4] also found that availability of community hospital beds was associated with reduced use of central inpatient services. All these documents suggest that GP hospitals do indeed reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
