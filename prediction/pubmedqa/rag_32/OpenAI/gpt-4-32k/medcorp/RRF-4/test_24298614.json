    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 7th TNM edition has been used for prognostic assessment in gastric cancer patients. However, some studies suggest that the 8th edition of the TNM classification provides a better prognostic refinement, especially in stage III groups. The 7th edition has been found to be less definitive in early gastric cancer (EGC), but the revised TNM staging reflects more aggressive biological behavior of cancer. Therefore, while it may have some utility, it may not be the most suitable for predicting the biological behavior of EGC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
