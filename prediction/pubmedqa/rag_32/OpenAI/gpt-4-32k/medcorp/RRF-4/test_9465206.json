    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a lot of information about the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing 'occult' posttraumatic lesions of the knee. These are injuries that are not easily detected through conventional methods. Many of the documents suggest that MRI can be a very useful tool in detecting and characterizing these types of injuries. For example, Document [0] concludes that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings. However, some documents also point out the limitations of MRI. For example, Document [24] suggests that MRI is not sensitive but is specific and somewhat accurate in detecting fresh traumatic articular cartilage lesions. Document [28] suggests that physical findings may not be adequate for the diagnosis of meniscal tears in patients with associated knee OA and that these patients may require an MRI or arthroscopy to establish the presence of a meniscal tear. Therefore, while MRI can be a very useful tool, it may not be able to completely substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in all cases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
