    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that epidural analgesia is an effective method of pain relief during labor and is widely used. However, it's also clear that not all women respond to it in the same way. For instance, Document [0] mentions a cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia. Document [1] also mentions that satisfaction with labor analgesia is not only determined by the efficacy of analgesia but a woman's sense of agency and involvement in the childbirth experience are also key contributors. Document [2] mentions that the effectiveness of labor epidural analgesia is difficult to explore, as it includes the maternal satisfaction with analgesia as well as the overall childbirth experience. Therefore, while epidural analgesia can be effective for many women, it may not be the best choice for all.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
