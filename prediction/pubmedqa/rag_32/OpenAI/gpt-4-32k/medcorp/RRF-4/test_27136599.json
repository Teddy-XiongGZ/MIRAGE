    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that rectal anastomosis can be performed safely without a diverting stoma in gynaecological debulking surgery. Document [0] states that low rectal resection during debulking procedures for gynaecological cancers can safely be performed by an experienced surgeon without a diverting stoma. Document [1] suggests that a diverting stoma is not necessary when performing a handsewn coloanal anastomosis for lower rectal cancer. Document [3] also supports the idea that a diverting temporary stoma is not necessary to decrease the chance of anastomotic leakage in middle and lower rectum cancer surgeries. However, it's important to note that the decision to perform a rectal anastomosis without a diverting stoma should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the patient's overall health and specific circumstances.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
