    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that thrombosis prophylaxis is not necessary for all hospitalized medical patients. Document [0] states that the incidence of venous thrombosis in a general internal ward is low and does not justify prophylaxis in all internal patients. It also mentions that cancer is a strong risk factor for hospital-acquired thrombosis, suggesting that prophylaxis may be more necessary for certain high-risk groups. Document [1] also mentions that thrombosis prophylaxis is generally recommended for bedridden inpatients with acute medical diseases, patients with underlying malignancies, or those suffering from acute ischemic stroke or paretic leg. This again suggests that not all patients require prophylaxis. Document [21] also mentions that routine application of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to low risk medical patients is likely to cause net harm, suggesting that prophylaxis should be given based on the patient's risk level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
