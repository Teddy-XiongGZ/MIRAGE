    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the effectiveness of sternal skin conductance as a surrogate for hot flash measurement. Some studies, such as those in Documents 2, 5, 10, 13, 17, 23, 26, 29, and 31, suggest that sternal skin conductance can be used to detect hot flashes and is associated with hot flash occurrence. However, other studies, such as those in Documents 0, 1, 4, 14, 24, and 27, highlight limitations and inconsistencies in the use of sternal skin conductance for hot flash measurement. These include discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes, difficulties with data collection, lack of consistency in interpretation, and poor sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, while sternal skin conductance may provide some useful information, it does not seem to be a fully reliable or accurate surrogate for hot flash measurement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
