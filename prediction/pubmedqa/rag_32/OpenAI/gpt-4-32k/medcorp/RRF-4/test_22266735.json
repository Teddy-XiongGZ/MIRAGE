    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that the criteria proposed by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are cost-effective. For instance, Document [0] states that the IADPSG recommendations are cost-effective when postdelivery care reduces diabetes incidence. Document [1] also mentions that there is an agreement that universal GDM screening is cost-effective. Document [2] also supports the cost-effectiveness of the new IADPSG guidelines. However, it's important to note that the cost-effectiveness can vary based on factors such as the effectiveness of postdelivery care and counseling, as well as the ability to prevent future diabetes in patients identified with GDM.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
