    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The HELLP syndrome is a severe complication of pre-eclampsia, as stated in Document [2]. Document [0] suggests that there are similarities between HELLP syndrome and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), implying a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia. This is further supported by Document [1], which reviews the evidence that the maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is caused by a maternal systemic inflammatory response. Document [13] also emphasizes the inflammatory hypothesis and the role of inflammatory cytokines deriving from the placenta in pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Therefore, there is substantial evidence to suggest that HELLP syndrome is evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
