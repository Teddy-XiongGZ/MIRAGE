    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that measuring myometrial electrical activity may enhance identification of patients in true premature labor. Document [1] also supports this by stating that myometrial electrical activity is inversely correlated with time-to-delivery and may effectively rule out preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks. Document [2] also suggests that uterine electrical activity can help in the diagnosis of preterm labour. Therefore, the answer is yes, myometrial electrical activity can identify patients in preterm labor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
