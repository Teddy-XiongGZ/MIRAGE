    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] shows that 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cell growth and a strong anti-angiogenic substance. It also states that 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. This suggests that the combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer. Document [1] also supports this, stating that 2-methoxyestradiol, alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, should be considered as a potential treatment for ovarian cancer. Document [8] also supports this, stating that 2-methoxyestradiol promoted the growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects of platinum-based agents in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, the answer is yes, the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol is able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutics in the treatment of human ovarian cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
