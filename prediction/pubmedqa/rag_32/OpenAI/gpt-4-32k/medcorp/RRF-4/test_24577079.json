    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that both young and older adults showed gains in working memory performance after training, but the age-related working memory deficit was not greatly affected. Document [1] also suggests that age differences in effective strategy use cannot explain the age-related variance in performance. Document [2] emphasizes the potential for cognitive plasticity in old-old age but also points to its limits. Document [3] suggests that combined cognitive training may be less efficient than pure memory training in memory outcomes. Document [14] suggests that different training techniques produce differential impacts upon the broader landscape of cognitive abilities. Document [15] suggests that older adults can be trained to use cognitive strategies, the effects are durable, and strategies are associated with memory and everyday functioning. Document [16] suggests that working memory performance can be improved throughout the life span. Document [17] suggests that the present working memory training program produces benefits maintained over time even in old-old adults. Document [24] suggests that training multiple functional categories simultaneously induces less transfer. Document [26] suggests that working memory training allows the discovery of strategies that enable better performance with the same working memory resources. Document [27] suggests that younger adults increase network segregation with training, suggesting more automated processing, older adults persist in, and potentially amplify, a more integrated and costly global workspace, suggesting different age-related trajectories in functional network reorganization with working memory training. Document [28] suggests that spacing seems to affect learning only minimally. Document [29] suggests that the variation in training schedule, at least within the range used here, does not seem to be a crucial element for training benefits. Document [30] suggests that age-related memory decrements correlate with metacognitive declines, including knowledge and deployment of effective mnemonic encoding strategies. Document [31] suggests that instructional intervention attenuated associative memory deficits, with some persistence over time. The present findings show merely imparting effective strategies holds promise for mitigating age-related associative memory deficits. Overall, the documents suggest that while strategy training can improve working memory performance in older adults, it does not necessarily reduce age-related deficits in working memory.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
