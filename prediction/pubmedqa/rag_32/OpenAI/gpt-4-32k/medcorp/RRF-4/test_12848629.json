    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] suggests that tuberculous enterocolitis can be managed by 9-month chemotherapy without disease recurrence. Document [14] also supports this, stating that there was no difference in efficacy of antituberculosis therapy delivered for either 6 months or 9 months in either gastrointestinal or peritoneal tuberculosis.

Therefore, based on these documents, a 9-month treatment seems to be sufficient in tuberculous enterocolitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
