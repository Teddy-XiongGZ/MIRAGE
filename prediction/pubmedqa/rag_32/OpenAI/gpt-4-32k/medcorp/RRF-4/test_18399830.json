    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy. For instance, Document [0] mentions that robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy had more favorable tumor characteristics including lower prostate specific antigen, clinical stage and Gleason score. Document [2] also mentions that robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is associated with decreased blood loss and limited postoperative pain and hospital stay. Document [5] supports the trend in shifting the standard of care for radical prostatectomy from an open to a robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach. Document [10] also mentions that RALP is a safe, minimally invasive, technically feasible procedure with comparable functional and oncological outcomes. Document [20] also mentions that the benefits of a robotic approach are largely related to its minimally invasive nature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
