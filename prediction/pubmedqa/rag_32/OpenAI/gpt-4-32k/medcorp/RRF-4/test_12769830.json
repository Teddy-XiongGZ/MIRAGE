    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that tumor depth per se should not influence a tumor's metastatic capability and that the prognostic value of tumor depth in soft tissue sarcomas can be explained by the association between tumor size and depth. Document [1] shows that tumor depth was significantly correlated with histological type and tumor size, but it does not clearly state whether it should be included in the prognostication. Document [2] mentions tumor depth as a prognostic factor influencing survival in soft tissue sarcomas, but it does not provide a clear stance on whether it should be included in the prognostication. Document [13] suggests that tumor size and depth are independent factors that predicted malignant soft tissue tumors. Based on these documents, it seems that while tumor depth is associated with other factors like tumor size and histological type, its independent contribution to the prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma is not clearly established.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
