    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] directly addresses the question and states that it appears safe to administer chemotherapy in rural towns under the supervision of medical oncologists from larger centres via teleoncology, provided that rural health care resources and governance arrangements are adequate. This is supported by Document [1] which states that the teleoncology model of care allows rural and Indigenous cancer patients to receive specialist consultations and chemotherapy treatments closer to home.

Therefore, the answer is yes, teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
