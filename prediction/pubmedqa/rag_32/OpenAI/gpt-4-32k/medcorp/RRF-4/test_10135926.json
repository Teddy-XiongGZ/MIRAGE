    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a ground setting. Document 1 also mentions that in-aircraft intubation is significantly more time-consuming in the Dauphin than in the BK-117. Document 2 suggests that flight crew members are associated with significantly higher rates of intubation success than ground ambulance providers. Document 3 states that the environment of a moving ambulance does not appear to hinder the ability of EMT-AIs to perform oral ETI in a laboratory setting with a mannequin model. Document 15 mentions that during the first eight years of operation of this air medical transport system, flight personnel were able to successfully perform endotracheal intubation in 92.1% of cases. Document 17 states that well-trained doctor paramedic teams, utilizing standardized operating procedures, can safely perform rapid sequence induction and ETI in the prehospital and emergency environment. Document 21 mentions that cuff pressure increased during HEMS transport, demonstrating the need for routine cuff pressure monitoring during flight. Document 27 states that using the GlideScope took more time to intubate compared with direct laryngoscopy in all tested environments. Document 31 also mentions that despite various factors increasing the difficulties in managing the airway in the field, definitive airway control by ETI seems to be safe practice. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that while there may be some challenges and differences in the process, the efficacy of oral endotracheal intubation is not necessarily impaired in the helicopter environment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
