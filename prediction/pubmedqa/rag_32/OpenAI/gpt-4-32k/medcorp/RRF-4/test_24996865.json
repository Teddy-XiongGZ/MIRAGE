    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] discusses a new approach for planning knee revision surgery by assessing joint lines (JLs) using the contralateral knee. This method involves measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee using radiographic images. The study found that the most precise parameter was the distance between the fibular head and the JL. Therefore, it can be concluded that assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee is a new approach for planning knee revision surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
