For instance, Document [0] states that the continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal, especially for postoperative clinic assessment. Document [2] also mentions that residents assessed only 52% of patients preoperatively, and only 40% of patients had complete continuity of care.

Therefore, it seems that trainees are not fully learning complete surgical care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
