    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that the risk of recurrent preterm birth differs based on the clinical presentation of a prior spontaneous preterm birth. It mentions that patients with a history of advanced cervical dilatation are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated with preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor. Document [21] also supports this by stating that preterm birth in a previous singleton pregnancy was confirmed as an independent risk factor for preterm birth in a subsequent twin pregnancy. This three-fold increase in risk remained stable regardless of year of birth, inclusion/exclusion of pregnancies following assisted reproduction, or defining preterm birth as < 34 or < 37 weeks' gestational age. Therefore, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth does predict risk in a subsequent pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
