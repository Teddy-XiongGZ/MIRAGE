    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what prosthetic valve endocarditis is. From the documents, I understand that it is a severe infection of the heart valve prostheses. The question is asking whether it is safe to replace only one valve when a patient with double prostheses has this condition. Document [0] suggests that single-valve replacement can be a safe strategy for patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis and double prostheses. It mentions that in 13 patients, only the prosthetic valve that seemed infected was replaced, and all these patients were considered cured with no observed relapses. However, it also mentions that four of these patients died within a week after the procedure. Document [1] also suggests that single valve replacement of the infected valve may be preferred in patients having previous double valve replacement. Therefore, while there may be some risks involved, it seems that single-valve replacement can be a safe strategy in certain cases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
