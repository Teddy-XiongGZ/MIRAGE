    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that women often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. It also mentions that single women delayed longer than single men and women who were alone when symptoms began delayed longer than women with someone. Document [1] mentions that there are important gender differences in the reasons patients delay and in their patterns of decision-making. Document [5] states that median delay was longer for insured patients than for uninsured patients and single, widowed, or divorced patients had longer delay times than did married patients. Document [24] mentions that women, especially those older than 65 years, delay longer than do men before seeking medical treatment for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Document [30] states that recognizing similarities and differences in symptom experiences of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) between men and women has implications for both health care providers and the general public.
