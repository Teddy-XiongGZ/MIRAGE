    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that albumin was no longer an independent predictor of survival in gastric cancer patients after multivariate analysis. Document 1 also suggests that the Glasgow prognostic score, which includes hypoalbuminemia as a factor, is not significant in early-stage gastric cancer patients. Document 2, however, suggests that preoperative serum albumin level was an independent factor associated with survival in gastric cancer patients. Document 3 does not mention albumin as an independent factor affecting survival. Document 13 suggests that preoperative serum albumin level correlated highly with resectability and survival. Document 26 suggests that preoperative hypoalbuminemia is an independent and negative prognostic factor for gastric cancer. Document 30 suggests that preoperative hypoalbuminemia can be used as both an independent predictive factor for severe post-operative complications and as a prognostic parameter regarding overall survival in EOC patients. Therefore, the evidence is mixed, with some studies suggesting that hypoalbuminemia is an independent prognostic factor and others suggesting it is not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
