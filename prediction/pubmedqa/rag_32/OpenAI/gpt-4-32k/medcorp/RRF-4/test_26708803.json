Document [0] discusses this topic in detail. It mentions that there is controversy regarding the management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion.

This suggests that less invasive treatment (i.e., not performing an inguinal incision) is more beneficial in these cases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
