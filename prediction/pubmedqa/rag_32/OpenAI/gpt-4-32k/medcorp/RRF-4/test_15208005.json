    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Omega-3 Index is defined as the percentage of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid in red blood cell fatty acids. Multiple documents suggest that low levels of Omega-3 Index are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death. For instance, Document [0] suggests that an Omega-3 Index of >= 8% was associated with the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of <= 4% was associated with the least. Document [1] also supports the idea that the Omega-3 Index qualifies as a coronary heart disease risk marker and/or risk factor. Document [2] proposes that the Omega-3 Index be considered at least a marker, if not a risk factor, for coronary heart disease. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that the Omega-3 Index can be considered a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
