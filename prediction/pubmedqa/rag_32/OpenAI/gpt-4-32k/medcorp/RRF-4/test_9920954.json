    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that admission to a top-ranked hospital was associated with lower adjusted 30-day mortality. Document 1 also states that the 30-day mortality rates were lower in ranked vs nonranked hospitals. Document 2 states that quality of care in specialty cardiac hospitals is similar to quality in competing general hospitals and top-ranked cardiac care hospitals. Document 4 states that as a group, the US News & World Report hospitals performed statistically better than their peers. Document 13 states that in a recent 3-year period, 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates for AMI and HF varied among hospitals and across the country. The readmission rates were particularly high. Document 14 states that hospitals with consistently poor performance on cardiac process measures also have lower patient satisfaction on average, suggesting that these hospitals have overall poor quality of care. However, there is discordance between the 2 measures in profiling hospital quality. Document 19 states that hospitals with consistently superior performance for both AMI and HF care had significantly lower risk-adjusted mortality than those with superior performance either alone or for neither measure. Document 21 states that hospitals with consistently poor performance on cardiac process measures also have lower patient satisfaction on average, suggesting that these hospitals have overall poor quality of care. However, there is discordance between the 2 measures in profiling hospital quality. Document 29 states that adherence to American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology practice guidelines has improved care of patients with AMI and is associated with significant reductions in in-hospital mortality rates. However, persistent gaps in overall care as well as care disparities remain and suggest the need for ongoing quality improvement efforts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
