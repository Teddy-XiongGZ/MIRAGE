    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a mixed view on the necessity of pelvic CT scans in cases of renal cell carcinoma. Some documents suggest that pelvic CT scans do not offer additional information in the majority of cases and should be performed selectively to reduce costs (Document 0). Other documents suggest that CT scans can be valuable in diagnosing and staging renal cell carcinoma (Document 1, Document 2, Document 3). However, the majority of the documents lean towards the view that pelvic CT scans are not necessary in all cases and should be used selectively. Therefore, the answer is not a definitive yes or no, but rather depends on the specific circumstances of the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
