    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that ureteroscopic stone retrieval can be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients. Several studies have shown that ureteroscopic treatment of ureteral stones can be safely and effectively performed with limited or no usage of fluoroscopy. However, it is also mentioned that fluoroscopy should always be available during these procedures, suggesting that while it may not be essential in all cases, it can be necessary in certain situations. Therefore, fluoroscopy is not essential for all cases of lower ureteric stone retrieval, but it may be necessary in certain situations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
