    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] describes a case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) because of a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. The authors speculate that the SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Document [13] also presents cases of spinal subdural hematoma occurring after intracranial aneurysm surgery. Document [23] describes a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to intradural cerebral aneurysm and simultaneous spinal subdural hematoma. These documents suggest that a spinal subdural hematoma can indeed be a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
