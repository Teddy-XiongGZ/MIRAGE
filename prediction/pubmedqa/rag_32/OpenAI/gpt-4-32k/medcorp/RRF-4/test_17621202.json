    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 suggests that shaving the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection. Document 1 also suggests that shaving of the scalp is not a critical step in the prevention of CSF shunt infection. Document 2 shows that the rate of infection is not lower after wet shaving than after dry shaving. Document 16 suggests that intraoperative administered fraction of inspired oxygen of less than 50% is an independent, modifiable risk factor for SSI after spinal surgery, but it does not mention shaving. Document 17 suggests that decompressive procedures performed later in the day carry a higher risk for postoperative infection, but it does not mention shaving. Document 27 suggests that cranial surgery without hair removal does not increase the risk of wound infection. Document 31 also suggests that cranial surgery without shaving does not increase the risk of severe wound infection. Based on these documents, it seems that shaving the incision site does not necessarily decrease the infection rate after spinal surgery, and it may even increase it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
