    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the correlation between the radiographic transition zone and the level of aganglionosis in Hirschsprung's disease. Some studies, such as those mentioned in Document [1] and Document [3], suggest that the radiographic transition zone can accurately predict the level of aganglionosis, especially in cases of rectosigmoid Hirschsprung's disease. However, other studies, like those mentioned in Document [0] and Document [11], argue that the correlation between the radiographic transition zone and the level of aganglionosis is low and can be inaccurate. Therefore, the answer is not definitively 'yes' or 'no'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
