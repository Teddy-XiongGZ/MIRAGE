    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] clearly states that in none of the 135 patients did frozen section alter the intraoperative management. Document [1] also mentions that in only one patient did the result of an intraoperative frozen section result in a total thyroidectomy being performed instead of a thyroid lobectomy. Document [2] also mentions that frozen section examination rarely affected intraoperative decision making in thyroid surgery. Document [3] also mentions that intraoperative frozen sections rarely alter the pre-surgical plan. Document [9] also mentions that only 2.1% of frozen sections accurately changed intraoperative management. Document [17] also mentions that frozen section offers minimal diagnostic utility in the evaluation of follicular thyroid lesions. Document [20] also mentions that intraoperative frozen section may be unnecessary. Document [24] also mentions that the findings of the present study do not support the use of frozen section in the surgical management of solitary thyroid nodules. Document [26] also mentions that intraoperative frozen sections are of little use and are not recommended systematically. Document [30] also mentions that intraoperative frozen sections of indeterminate thyroid nodules are of little use and are not recommended systematically. Document [31] also mentions that intraoperative frozen section added very little to surgical management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
