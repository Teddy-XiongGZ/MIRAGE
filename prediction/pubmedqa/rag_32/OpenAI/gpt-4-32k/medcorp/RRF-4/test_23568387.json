    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what bicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty are. From the documents, I understand that bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is a procedure that involves replacing two compartments of the knee, while total knee arthroplasty involves replacing the entire knee joint. Now, I need to compare the effects of these two procedures on knee muscle strength and physical performance. Document [0] states that although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty. Document [1] suggests that medial bicompartmental arthroplasty results in nearer-normal gait and improved patient-reported outcomes compared to total knee arthroplasty. However, Document [2] suggests that total knee arthroplasty was associated with better short-term results compared with bicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Document [16] also suggests that total knee arthroplasty resulted in inferior extensor function compared to unicompartmental and bicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Document [18] suggests that contemporary unlinked bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was associated with greater comfort during everyday activities (forgotten knee) and better functional outcomes, compared to total knee arthroplasty. Document [21] suggests that bicompartmental knee arthroplasty for medial patellofemoral osteoarthritis is comparable with total knee arthroplasty in terms of short-term function, complication rate, and revision rate. Document [23] suggests that contemporary modular bicompartmental knee arthroplasty produced better functional outcomes than total knee arthroplasty after at least two years. Document [25] suggests that bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is a reliable technique in selected cases and especially younger people with higher functional requests can favourably profit from it. Document [27] suggests that minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty offers superior short-term as well as possible long-term results. Document [30] suggests that minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty led to a more rapid and more complete recovery of muscle strength than has been previously demonstrated after total knee arthroplasty with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy. Based on these documents, it seems that the answer is not clear cut and depends on various factors such as the specific patient population, the specific type of bicompartmental knee arthroplasty used, and the specific outcomes measured.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
