    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen could be a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring. Document [0] discusses the development of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach as an alternative to optical analysis for the detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa. The results of the study were promising, indicating that this approach could be a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
