    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that BMI does influence morbidity and long-term survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy. For instance, Document [0] states that a significantly longer mean survival rate was observed for the lower body mass index group in stage 2 and for the higher BMI group in stage 3a. Document [1] also mentions that a high BMI 1 year after surgery was associated with lower overall mortality compared to normal BMI. Document [4] suggests that preoperative BMI may have an influence on the long-term outcomes of advanced gastric cancer after radical surgery and chemotherapy. Document [10] states that the 5-year survival rate following curative gastrectomy is better in overweight than nonoverweight Japanese patients, especially for early-stage gastric cancer. Document [20] states that higher postoperative BMI (\u2265 23) was significantly associated with longer survival time, whereas severe BMI loss (&gt;10%) at one year after surgery was associated with worse outcomes. Therefore, the answer is yes, BMI does influence morbidity and long-term survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
