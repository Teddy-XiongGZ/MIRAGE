    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] directly addresses the question. It states that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure. This is based on the observation that nude mice, which lack T cells, showed a longer escape latency in a spatial learning task after exposure to toluene compared to wild-type mice. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
