    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that classic histologic grading schemes for astrocytomas have included evaluating the presence or absence of nuclear abnormalities, mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation, and tumor necrosis. It also mentions that different grades of astrocytomas showed different vascular patterns. Document 1 also indicates that the endothelium in high-grade astrocytomas displayed marked DNA abnormalities. Document 3 mentions that there is a lack of endothelial proliferation in Grade III astrocytomas. Document 4 mentions that the St Anne-Mayo grading system uses endothelial proliferation as one of the criteria to assign a grade to astrocytomas. Document 5 mentions that tumor vascularity has known importance in astrocytomas, in which endothelial proliferation is a criterion for anaplasia in many grading schemes. All these documents suggest that endothelial cell patterns are indicative of the grade of astrocytomas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
