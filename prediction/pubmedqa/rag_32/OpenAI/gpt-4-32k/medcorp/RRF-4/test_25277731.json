    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sternal fractures in children are indeed rare, as stated in multiple documents such as Document [0], Document [1], Document [2], Document [3], Document [4], Document [5], Document [9], Document [12], Document [25], Document [27], and Document [29]. However, the question also asks if these fractures are often overlooked. While the documents do not provide explicit information on this aspect, it can be inferred from the various studies and case reports that these fractures are not necessarily overlooked, but rather, they are challenging to diagnose due to their rarity and the relative plasticity of the pediatric thorax. Therefore, the answer to the question would be 'no'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
