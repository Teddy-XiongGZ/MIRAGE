    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that deflation of expanders was a significant risk factor for overall complications and reconstruction failures. Document [1] also supports this by stating that expander deflation immediately prior to radiotherapy may augment the adverse effects. Document [10] also suggests that deflation of the tissue expander prior to radiotherapy can lead to complications. Therefore, it can be concluded that partial expander deflation can exacerbate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
