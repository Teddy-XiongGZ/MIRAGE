    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] provides a clear answer to the question. It states that vertical lines in esophageal mucosa (VLEM) were observed in a group of children with histological esophagitis. The study found that most patients in Group 2, where VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities, had eosinophilic esophagitis.
