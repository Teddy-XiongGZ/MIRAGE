    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that fluctuating PSA levels do not necessarily indicate a lower risk of prostate cancer. Document [0] and Document [1] both state that there is no significant difference in cancer detection rates between patients with fluctuating PSA levels and those with steadily increasing PSA levels. Document [3] also suggests that the risk of prostate cancer at repeat biopsy was higher in men with a fluctuating PSA level and PSA velocity (PSAV)\u22651.0 ng/mL/yr than in those with a fluctuating PSA level and PSAV<1.0 ng/mL/yr. Therefore, fluctuating PSA levels should not be considered reassuring enough to avoid biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
