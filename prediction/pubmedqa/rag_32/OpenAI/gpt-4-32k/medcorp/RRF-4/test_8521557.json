    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ACE gene I/D polymorphism has been studied in relation to insulin resistance in multiple documents. Document [0] concludes that the DD genotype of the ACE gene is associated with increased insulin sensitivity in NIDDM subjects, not insulin resistance. Document [1] suggests that the ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with whole-body insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose tolerance. Document [2] concludes that the I allele is associated with insulin resistance in glucose-tolerant and normotensive African-Americans. Document [5] suggests that the D allele of the ACE gene may be associated with higher insulin sensitivity, while the I allele may be associated with greater insulin resistance. Document [16] suggests that the ACE gene I/D polymorphism influences glomerular filtration and renal plasma flow rates in patients with early uncomplicated IDDM, which could indirectly affect insulin resistance. Document [28] concludes that the ACE gene I/D polymorphism does not appear to contribute to the biochemical and phenotypic characteristic of APA, however, the deletion of the insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism in 16% of aldosterone-producing adenomas may represent the loss of a tumour suppressor gene/s or other genes on chromosome 17q which may contribute to tumorigenesis in APA. Overall, the evidence is mixed, with some studies suggesting a link between the ACE gene I/D polymorphism and insulin resistance, and others suggesting a link with insulin sensitivity or no link at all.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
