    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] provides evidence that dogs can positively modulate the behavior of children with ASD, leading to more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors and less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors. Document [1] also supports this, stating that children with autism demonstrated increased verbal abilities and social interaction during therapy sessions when animals were present compared to traditional therapy sessions without them. Document [2] mentions that modern animal-assisted therapy is about a natural way to bring about socializing and also for stress reduction. Document [3] discusses the effect of integrating service dogs into families with an autistic child, stating that the presence of the dog promoted awareness of autism and affected social interaction. Document [4] talks about how autism assistance dogs can help their owners live independently and navigate the world, and how they can help open the door for children and keep them from becoming over-stimulated. Document [10] mentions that animal-assisted therapy may reduce the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder such as aggressiveness, irritability, distractibility, and hyperactivity. Document [11] reports that parents supported the use of AAT and that dogs facilitated therapeutic gains. Document [13] mentions that physical interaction with therapy dogs improves cardiovascular health, and as a result patients may need less medication. Document [18] mentions that a higher response rate during contingent dog sessions than baseline sessions occurred for 4 out of 5 participants, suggesting that the dog functioned as a reinforcer. Document [19] found a significant increase in synchrony between child and therapy dog over time. Document [25] mentions that the remarkable adherence to the therapy program by study participants and the program's clinically relevant effects indicate that AAT with dogs can be used to reduce perceived stress and symptoms of agoraphobia, and to improve social awareness and communication in adults with ASD with normal to high intelligence. Document [26] demonstrated the positive effects of the AAA on the social behavior of children with ASD. Document [29] mentions that the interaction between patients and therapy dogs also aids reducing stressful and anxious feelings patients have. Document [30] mentions that a holistic intervention is needed for individuals who suffer from autism spectrum disorders and that our objective was to work with these individuals in a multidisciplinary manner through the use of animal-assisted therapy, finding improvements in the experimental group as compared with the control group in the different evaluated areas. All these documents provide evidence that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
