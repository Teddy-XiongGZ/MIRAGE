    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The euthyroid sick syndrome is a condition where the levels of thyroid hormones in the blood are abnormal, but the thyroid gland itself is not. Document [0] suggests that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the euthyroid sick syndrome during and after CPB. Document [2] also indicates that alterations in serum concentration of thyroid hormones occur even in euthyroid patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Document [6] further supports this by stating that coronary artery bypass grafting-associated euthyroid sick syndrome exerted detrimental effects on short-term clinical outcomes in high-risk patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. Document [10] also indicates that cardiopulmonary bypass simulates the euthyroid sick syndrome. Therefore, it seems that the temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass does not prevent the development of the euthyroid sick syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
