    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that epidural analgesia can be used safely in surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Document [0] states that in a series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. Document [1] also supports the safety and effectiveness of epidural analgesia in this context. Document [18] further supports the safety of epidural analgesia in patients undergoing CRS with HIPEC. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that epidural analgesia is not a risky technique for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
