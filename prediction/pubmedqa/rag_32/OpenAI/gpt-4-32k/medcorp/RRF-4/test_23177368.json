    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a lot of information about the impact of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) on the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Many studies suggest that IBR does not lead to a significant delay in the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Some studies do mention a slight delay, but it is often not considered clinically significant.

Therefore, it seems that in general, IBR does not compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
