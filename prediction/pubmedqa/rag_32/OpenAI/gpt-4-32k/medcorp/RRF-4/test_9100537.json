    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the ability of fine-needle aspiration cytology to distinguish between nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without atypia. Document [0] suggests that the distinction is difficult due to significant overlap in cytologic features. Document [1] also indicates that fine needle aspiration has limitations in classifying benign breast diseases. However, Document [5] suggests that a cytologic grading system can be used to further subclassify benign breast disease and distinguish these forms from neoplastic lesions. Document [14] also suggests that a scoring system can increase the diagnostic accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology. However, the overall consensus seems to be that while some distinguishing features may exist, the overlap in cytologic features makes the distinction challenging.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
