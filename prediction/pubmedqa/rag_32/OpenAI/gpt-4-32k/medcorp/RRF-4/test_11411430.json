    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that antral follicle assessment is a strong predictor of IVF outcomes. For instance, Document [0] states that antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Document [1] also suggests that antral follicle count (AFC) is better than AMH to predict poor ovarian response, although age was the only independent predictor of live birth in IVF. Document [2] suggests that the predictive performance of AFC toward poor response is significantly better than that of basal FSH. Document [25] also found that an AFC of \u226511 was a strong positive predictor of live birth. However, it's important to note that while antral follicle assessment may be a better predictor of certain IVF outcomes, age and FSH levels are still important factors to consider.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
