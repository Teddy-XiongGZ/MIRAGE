    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alexithymia is a cognitive-affective disturbance characterized by difficulties in differentiating one's feelings and expressing them in words. It has been suggested that alexithymia could be a predisposing factor for the development or persistence of medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, the studies show mixed results. Some studies suggest that alexithymia is associated with the development of medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS), while others found no strong association between alexithymia and the persistence of MUPS. Therefore, it's not clear whether alexithymia is a risk factor for unexplained physical symptoms in general medical outpatients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
