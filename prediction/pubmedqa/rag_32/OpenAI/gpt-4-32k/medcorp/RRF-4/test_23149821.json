    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that HIV-infected patients, particularly men older than 52 years with at least two other cardiovascular risk factors, are more likely to have silent myocardial ischaemia. This is confirmed by myocardial SPECT, which was about four times more likely to be positive in this group than in the general population. Document [1] also supports this, stating that HIV patients demonstrated a higher prevalence of perfusion defects than controls, despite similar risk scores. Document [24] also suggests that exercise testing might be recommended for patients with HIV who have central fat accumulation and hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that HIV-infected patients should be screened for silent myocardial ischaemia using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
