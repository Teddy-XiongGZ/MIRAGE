    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information about the prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness and its potential progression to Meniere's disease. Document [0] concludes that not all low-tone sudden deafness patients suffer from endolymphatic hydrops or progress to Meniere's disease. Document [1] states that among 80 patients with low tone sudden deafness, only 6 cases (7.5%) subsequently progressed to Meniere's disease. Document [2] also suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in the rates of progression to Meniere's disease between patients with low-tone loss and those with other types of hearing loss. Document [3] indicates that in clinical practice, sudden low-tone loss other than acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss shows a potential for recurrence and progression to Meniere's disease, but it does not state that this is inevitable. Document [25] concludes that although almost every patient with Meniere's disease suffers from recurrent hearing loss, only a few patients with recurrent hearing loss will develop Meniere's disease. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that low-tone sudden deafness does not inevitably progress to Meniere's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
