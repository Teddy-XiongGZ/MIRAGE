    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that in a study, TME with IONM was associated with significant lower rates of urinary and anorectal dysfunction. Document 1 mentions that a randomized controlled trial is being conducted to compare the functional outcome in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME with and without pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring (pIONM). Document 2 concludes that pIONM is safe and has the potential to improve functional outcomes in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME. Document 24 states that in a prospective 2-year follow-up study, pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring was associated with significantly lower rates of urinary and sexual dysfunction. Therefore, it can be concluded that intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with better functional outcome in patients undergoing open TME.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
