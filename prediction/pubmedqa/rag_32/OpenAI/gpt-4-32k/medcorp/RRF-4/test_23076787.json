    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] shows that an increase in cigarette taxes in Minnesota led to a significant reduction in the number of packs purchased, suggesting that the tax increase was passed on to consumers through higher retail prices. Document [1] provides an example from China where an increase in excise tax did not translate into higher retail prices due to the intervention of the Chinese State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. However, this seems to be an exception rather than the rule, as it is specific to China's unique market conditions. Document [2] also supports the link between tax increases and retail prices, showing that a tobacco tax increase in Minnesota led to significant price increases for all studied tobacco products. Document [4] indicates that state taxes are more than passed on - a 1-cent state tax increase results in a price increase of 1.11 cents. Document [14] suggests that raising cigarette prices via taxation remains an effective public health policy. Document [16] shows that a large increase in cigarette tax would reduce cigarette consumption effectively, and would also increase the Government's cigarette tax revenue and cigarette merchants' income. Document [26] shows that the price of the market-leading Australian cigarette brand increased significantly in the 3 years after plain packaging was introduced, and these increases were above the combined effects of inflation and increases in excise/customs duty. Document [30] suggests that strict cigarette minimum price laws may result in higher cigarette prices. Overall, the majority of the documents suggest that increases in the cigarette tax rate can be linked to cigarette retail prices, with the exception of specific market conditions like those in China.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
