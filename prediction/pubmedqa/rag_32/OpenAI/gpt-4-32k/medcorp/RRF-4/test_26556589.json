    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is Document [0]. According to this document, the study compared Achilles tendon load-response in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and controls. The results showed that there were no diabetic complications and no response to load was seen in either T1DM or control group over the 4-days post exercise. This suggests that active individuals with T1DM do not have a heightened Achilles tendon response to load, which suggests no increased risk of tendon injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
