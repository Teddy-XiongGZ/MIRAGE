    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that the association between marital status, living arrangement, and mortality does vary by gender. For instance, Document [0] states that the benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women, and mortality risks were highest for divorced and single men who lived alone. Document [1] also suggests that the presence of a partner is mortality protective, especially among 50-64-year-old men. Document [5] shows that non-married men and those living alone show a statistically significant increased mortality risk compared to their married or cohabiting counterparts. After age-adjustment, women's survival is influenced neither by marital status nor by cohabitation status. Document [14] also suggests that marital status continues to be a direct measure of living arrangements among older adults in Chile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
