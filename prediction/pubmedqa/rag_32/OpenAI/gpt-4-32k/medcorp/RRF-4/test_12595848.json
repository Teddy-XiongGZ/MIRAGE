    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents suggest that specialty care is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure. For instance, Document [0] indicates that involvement of a cardiologist in the care of patients admitted to the hospital with CHF is associated with improved clinical outcome. Document [6] also found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care. Document [7] suggests that patients with congestive heart failure followed by both specialists and family physicians had significantly better survival than those followed by family physicians alone. Document [24] also indicates that patients participating in a heart failure clinic enjoyed improved survival. Document [27] suggests that cardiologist-delivered ADHF care is associated with greater adherence to HF core measures and with significantly lower rates of adverse outcome compared with noncardiologists. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that specialty care is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
