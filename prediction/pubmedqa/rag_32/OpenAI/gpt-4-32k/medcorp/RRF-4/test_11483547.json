    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document states that acute side effects of antivenin were seen in 12 patients (18%), but these side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but one patient. This patient had a history of previous antivenin reaction and required a short course of intravenous epinephrine for blood pressure support. No other complications occurred. The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon. This suggests that the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
