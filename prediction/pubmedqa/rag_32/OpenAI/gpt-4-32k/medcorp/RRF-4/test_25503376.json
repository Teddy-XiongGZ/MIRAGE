    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that surgery may improve blood lipid levels in patients with OSA, especially in patients with preoperative dyslipidemia. Document 1 also supports this, stating that sleep surgery lowered total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels. Document 14 also mentions that effective multilevel surgery could significantly reduce leptin level in OSA patients and this reduction is correlated with the degree of OSA improvement. Document 25 also supports this, stating that upper airway surgery does reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with OSA. Therefore, the answer is yes, airway surgery does lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
