    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is Document [0]. It states that the length of stay decreased significantly over the 4 years for all of the four categories, the smallest change being observed for patients with AMI (11.1%) and the largest for those with bronchitis or asthma (22.0%). The readmission rates for AMI, bronchitis or asthma, and TURP showed no consistent change over the 4 years. The readmission rate for uterine or adnexal procedures increased significantly between the first and second year but then remained constant over the next 3 years. The mean number of physician visits increased slightly for AMI in the first year and then remained virtually the same. It decreased slightly for bronchitis or asthma over the 4 years. There was no significant correlation between length of stay and readmission rates for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in any of the four categories. Also, no correlation was observed between length of stay and mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in the categories AMI and bronchitis or asthma. Therefore, improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
