    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that gender does play a role in the response to injury and hemorrhagic shock. However, the role of hormones in this response is not entirely clear. Some studies suggest that hormones, specifically sex hormones, do have an impact on the response to injury and shock. For example, female sex hormones (i.e., estrogen) have been found to have protective effects following trauma-hemorrhage, while male sex steroids (i.e. 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, 5alpha-DHT) are suppressive to immune and cardiac functions under those conditions. However, other studies suggest that factors other than sex hormones may be responsible for gender-based differences after injury. Therefore, while hormones may play a role, they are not the sole factor responsible for the observed gender differences in response to injury and shock.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
