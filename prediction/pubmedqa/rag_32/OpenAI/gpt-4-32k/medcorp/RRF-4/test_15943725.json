    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that serum pancreatic lipase may be a more accurate biomarker for acute pancreatitis than serum amylase. Document [0] shows that serum pancreatic lipase has improved diagnostic accuracy compared to serum amylase. Document [1] also supports this, stating that serum lipase offers a higher sensitivity than serum amylase in diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Document [2] concludes that lipase should replace amylase as the first-line laboratory investigation for suspected acute pancreatitis. Document [3] suggests that serum lipase is more sensitive than serum amylase. Document [8] and [18] recommend the use of lipase over amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that serum pancreatic lipase should replace serum amylase as a biomarker of acute pancreatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
