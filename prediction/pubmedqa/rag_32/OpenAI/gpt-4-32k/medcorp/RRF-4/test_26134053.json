    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if outcome feedback within emergency medicine training programs is an opportunity to apply the theory of deliberate practice. The theory of deliberate practice involves focused, repetitive practice with the aim of improving performance. Document [0] discusses a survey conducted on Canadian Royal College emergency medicine residents and program directors to determine the extent of active outcome feedback and follow-up. The results showed that mandatory active outcome feedback was not present in any EM training program for admitted or discharged patients. However, a majority of residents believed that patient follow-up should be mandatory and placed a significantly greater educational value on outcome feedback than their program directors. This suggests that there is potential for the theory of deliberate practice to be applied within these programs, as it would involve repetitive practice and feedback to improve performance. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
