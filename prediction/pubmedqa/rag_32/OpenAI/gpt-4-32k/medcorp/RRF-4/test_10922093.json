    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 suggests that patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Document 1 also indicates that patients referred for open access endoscopy would have preferred prior consultation with a gastroenterologist. However, Document 11 suggests that patients who used the open access service were no more anxious about their procedures or less cooperative during them than patients first seen in the GI clinic. This implies that while there may be less information given, it does not necessarily negatively impact the patient's experience or cooperation. Therefore, it seems that while open access endoscopy may provide less information to patients, it does not necessarily 'close the door' to an adequately informed patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
