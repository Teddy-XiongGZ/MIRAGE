    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that selective embolization contributes to survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinomas. Document [1] suggests that the size of the main tumor significantly influences the prognosis following TAE. Document [2] reveals that adjunct hepatectomy, tumor size, bilirubin, albumin, globulin, and the 15-min retention rate of indocyanine green are statistically significant prognostic factors for hepatic arterial chemoembolization. Document [3] indicates that age, hepatitis C virus antibody positivity, serum albumin, absence of portal vein invasion and serum alpha-fetoprotein level are significantly associated with favorable survival. Document [4] suggests that the degree of extension of tumor embolus in the portal vein or its branch and the tumor type are important factors. These documents suggest that technical factors do affect the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing hepatic arterial embolization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
