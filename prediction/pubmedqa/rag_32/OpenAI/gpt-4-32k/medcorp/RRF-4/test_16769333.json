    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) enables the accurate examination of the tracheobronchial tree, the visualization of tracheoesophageal fistula and the diagnosis of tracheomalacia or associated respiratory anomalies. Document [1] states that TBS was clinically useful in 45.2% of 62 patients, including 24.2% of 62 infants in whom it was crucial in modifying the surgical approach. Document [2] suggests that preoperative laryngotracheobronchoscopy (LTB) just prior to the standard surgical procedure in EA and EA-TEF would diagnose, document and may aid in the surgical management strategies. Document [3] suggests that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that routine preoperative LTB becomes the standard of care. Document [13] suggests that the presence of laryngotracheal abnormalities (LTA) is associated with increased morbidity and higher mortality rate in esophageal atresia patients. Document [24] states that perioperative complications represent a significant burden to the EA/TEF infants and a technical challenge for the surgeon. Document [26] states that tracheal endoscopy is useful in improving the diagnostic approach and to prevent pulmonary complications. Fistula incannulation minimizes the risk of gastric distension and its detrimental effect on ventilation, helping the surgeon to identify TEF easily and quickly. Document [30] states that stable respiratory and metabolic parameters in the majority of patients allow a surgical intervention within a limited time frame during the first days of life. As it is hardly possible to plan the surgical procedure, an experienced team as well as neonatal intensive care facilities and operation room access must be available throughout the week. All these documents suggest that preoperative tracheobronchoscopy does matter in newborns with esophageal atresia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
