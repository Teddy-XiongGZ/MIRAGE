    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that c-Kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma and that its molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth. Furthermore, treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-Kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death. This suggests that c-Kit could be a potential therapeutic target for uveal melanoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
