    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 1 directly addresses the question and shows that most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering after receiving education about radiation from a radiologist. However, Document 13 shows that an educational intervention improved residents' knowledge regarding the risks of ionizing radiation exposure from medical imaging, and increased participant self-reported comfort levels in the discussion of these risks with patients. Document 23 also shows that a statewide, CT scan educational campaign contributed to a decrease in effective radiation dose (lower dose scans and fewer repeat scans) among transferred injured children seen at pediatric trauma centers. Therefore, while the immediate change in ordering practices may not be significant, education seems to have a positive impact on awareness and could potentially lead to changes in ordering practices over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
