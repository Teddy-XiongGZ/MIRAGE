    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that decisional algorithms are used to assess the causality of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, according to Document [0], while these algorithms are sensitive methods for detecting ADRs, they present poor specificity. The document concludes that algorithms do not replace global introspection and are not definite alternatives in the individual causality assessment of suspected ADRs. This is further supported by Document [1] and Document [2] which highlight the limitations and inconsistencies of decisional algorithms in assessing causality. Therefore, based on the provided documents, decisional algorithms cannot replace global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
