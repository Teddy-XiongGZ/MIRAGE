    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that the Trendelenburg position is recommended during liver resection to decrease the risk of venous air embolism. However, this position raises the central venous pressure and may increase blood loss. The reverse-Trendelenburg position can be safely and effectively used to maintain a low central venous pressure during liver surgery. Document [1] also states that positioning of the patient in a head-down tilt (Trendelenburg position) decreases the likelihood of a venous air embolism during liver resection. Document [8] suggests that changes in body position resulted in marked changes in CVP but not in HVPs. Head down or head up tilt to reduce venous pressures in the liver may therefore not be effective measures to reduce blood loss during liver surgery. Document [21] also suggests that the sitting position can be safely used in more complex instrumented cervical surgery. Document [29] also suggests that the incidence and grade of VAE in the head-up tilt group were significantly lower than those in the supine group during abdominal myomectomy. Therefore, it can be concluded that patient position during liver surgery does influence the risk of venous air embolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
