    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not necessarily an early stage cancer. Document [0] states that well-differentiated HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with well-differentiated and less differentiated HCCs. Document [1] also indicates that early HCCs are histologically well-differentiated, but it does not state that all well-differentiated HCCs are early stage. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that well-differentiated HCC is clinically early cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
