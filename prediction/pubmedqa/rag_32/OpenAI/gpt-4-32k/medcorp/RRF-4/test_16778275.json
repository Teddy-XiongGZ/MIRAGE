    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 suggests that routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine chest radiography is not necessary in this category of patients. Document 3 also supports this, stating that routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary and can be safely avoided in asymptomatic patients without significant desaturation events. Document 2 also concludes that routine chest radiographs have a low diagnostic yield and may not be necessary in all patients after fluoroscopically guided transbronchial biopsy. Therefore, the majority of the documents suggest that routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary in all cases, especially in asymptomatic patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
