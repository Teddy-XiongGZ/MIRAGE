    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 clearly states that complex coronary lesions such as bifurcation and ostial lesions were significantly more common in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. This is further supported by Document 1, which mentions that patients with myocardial infarction in combination with type 2 diabetes have much more frequent multivessel disease and coronary delay. Document 2 also mentions that patients with diabetes had moderate stenosis much more frequently than patients without diabetes. Document 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 all provide additional evidence that complex coronary lesions are more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
