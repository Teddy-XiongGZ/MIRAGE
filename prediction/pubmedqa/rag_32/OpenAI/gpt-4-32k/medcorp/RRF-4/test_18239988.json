    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that routine laboratory markers are not sufficient to differentiate nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis. For instance, Document [0] states that specific markers for differentiation are lacking, and while some parameters like the AST/ALT ratio and MCV were found to be more common in ASH, they do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Document [2] also suggests that the AST/ALT ratio might be useful in differential diagnosis, but it is not definitive. Document [5] suggests that a model using variables like mean corpuscular volume, AST/ALT ratio, body mass index, and gender can accurately differentiate ALD from NAFLD, but this is not a routine laboratory marker. Therefore, while some markers might provide some guidance, they are not definitive for differentiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
