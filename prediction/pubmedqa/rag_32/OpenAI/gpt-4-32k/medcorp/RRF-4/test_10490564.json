    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that in patients with ischaemic heart disease and hypotension, symptomatic and silent ischaemia occurred in a temporally causal relation with hypotension, particularly for diastolic pressures. This suggests that patients with coronary disease may be susceptible to ischaemic events incurred as a result of low blood pressure caused by excessive hypotensive drug treatment. Document [1] also suggests that nifedipine administration for hypertensive emergencies can induce neurological and cardiac events due to abrupt hypotension. Document [2] suggests that hypotension during DSE was predictive of the combined end point of perioperative cardiac mortality, myocardial infarction, and ischemia. Document [3] suggests that applying permissive hypotension to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease limiting myocardial function (such as angina pectoris) may result in decreased coronary perfusion and result in ischemic damage to the heart and potentially myocardial infarction. Document [5] suggests that in patients having noncardiac surgery, perioperative hypotension was associated with cardiovascular events regardless of the degree of coronary artery disease on preoperative coronary computed tomographic angiography. Document [6] suggests that blood flows through the left coronary artery during diastole. Hence, coronary blood flow in patients with diastolic orthostatic hypotension could be reduced, resulting in a poor survival prognosis. Document [8] suggests that even in the presence of normal blood pressure, clinical signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, which may be subtle, are associated with a substantial risk of in-hospital death following acute myocardial infarction. Document [17] suggests that during right coronary artery occlusion and with reperfusion, bradycardia and hypotension develop more commonly in patients with proximal occlusions compared with those with distal occlusions. Document [23] suggests that the higher the level of the baseline systolic blood pressure was, the higher the incidence of PPH was. And the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebral vascular events in patients during hospitalization were increased by PPH. Document [30] suggests that local histamine release may induce spasm of the coronary vasculature, thus leading to myocardial ischemia and infarction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
