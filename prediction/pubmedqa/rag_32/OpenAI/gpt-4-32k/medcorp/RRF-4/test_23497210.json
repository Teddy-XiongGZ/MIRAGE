    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that women with major depression in pregnancy can be identified in population health data. For instance, Document [0] discusses a study that investigated the differences in ascertainment between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example.
