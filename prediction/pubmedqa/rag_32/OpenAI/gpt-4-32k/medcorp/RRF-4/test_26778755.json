    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that traditionally, dose-point evaluation has been used in vaginal dose assessment in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer. However, with the development of imaging technologies and the introduction of 3D image-based brachytherapy, there has been a shift towards more comprehensive and accurate dose assessment methods. These methods allow for better coverage of the targets while sparing organs at risk, leading to improved local control and survival rates. Therefore, while dose-point evaluation can still be used, it may not be the most reliable or accurate method for vaginal dose assessment in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
