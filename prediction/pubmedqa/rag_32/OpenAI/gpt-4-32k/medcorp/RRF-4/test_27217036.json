    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neoadjuvant Imatinib is used for locally advanced Gastrointestinal stromal Tumours (GIST). The question is whether KIT mutation analysis will be a pathfinder, meaning whether it will guide the treatment. According to Document [0], patients with exon 9 KIT mutations have a worse outcome, but progression-free survival is improved by treatment with imatinib 800 mg daily. Document [5] also mentions that the response rate for the exon 11 mutants was higher than the non-exon 11 mutant group. This suggests that KIT mutation analysis can indeed guide the treatment and thus can be considered a pathfinder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
