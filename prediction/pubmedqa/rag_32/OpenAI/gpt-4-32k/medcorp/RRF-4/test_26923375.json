    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that duplex Doppler ultrasonography can be used as a non-invasive method for diagnosing esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis. For instance, Document [0] states that a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index was used to predict the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis. Document [1] also supports this, stating that Doppler ultrasonography has high diagnostic accuracy in predicting the presence of esophageal varices in patients with hepatitis-C induced cirrhosis. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
