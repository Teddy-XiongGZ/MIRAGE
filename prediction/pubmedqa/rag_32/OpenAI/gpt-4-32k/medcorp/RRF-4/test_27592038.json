    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what cervicogenic somatic tinnitus is. From the documents, it is clear that this type of tinnitus can be related to the somatosensory system of the cervical spine. Next, I need to find evidence in the documents that supports or refutes the idea that multi-modal cervical physical therapy can improve this type of tinnitus. Document [0] suggests a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. It mentions that after treatment, 53% of patients experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. Document [1] also supports this, stating that patients with co-varying tinnitus and neck complaints had significantly lower TFI-scores after treatment and follow-up. Therefore, the evidence suggests that multi-modal cervical physical therapy can improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
