    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that the use of hydrophilic guidewires made a significant difference to the technical success rate of PTA, especially in occlusion and more complicated lesions. Document [2] also supports this, stating that since the introduction of hydrophilic guidewires, the technical success rates of PTA have improved and are now approaching 100%. Document [17] also mentions that the use of hydrophilic guidewires can improve the success rate of PCI in CTO lesions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of hydrophilic guidewires significantly improves the technical success rates of peripheral PTA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
