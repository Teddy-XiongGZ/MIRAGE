    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that fears of recurrence were directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism. Document [1] suggests that fear of recurrence in head and neck cancer patients is associated with female sex, younger age, and history of a past recurrence or second primary malignancy. Document [2] indicates that caregivers who reported more loneliness, spent more time caring, and had greater financial stress from caring had higher scores on Worry of Cancer (FOR). Document [14] shows that self-management behaviours accounted for 20% to 39.4% of the variance in QoL and FoR. Document [16] suggests that spirituality was the only predictor of perceived risk independent of the effect of race, even when worry about general health was controlled. Document [22] shows that persistent or emerging post-treatment symptoms and functional limitations are probable risk factors for late-occurring FCR in UM survivors. Document [27] shows that patients with high stable FCR were younger, reported more negative adjustment, passive coping, and reassuring thoughts, and less avoidance. All these documents suggest that there are certain factors that can predict which head and neck cancer survivors develop fears of recurrence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
