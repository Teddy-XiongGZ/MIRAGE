    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state. Document [2] suggests that beta-endorphin deficiency continues despite withdrawal symptoms subsiding in patients, suggesting that reduced beta-endorphin activity may be a trait contributing to alcohol craving. Document [10] states that people with a genetic deficit of beta-endorphin peptide are particularly susceptible to alcoholism. The plasma level of beta-endorphin in subjects genetically at high risk of excessive alcohol consumption shows lower basal activity of this peptide. Document [15] suggests that restoring the alcohol-induced deficiency of beta-endorphin may be an important factor in the prevention of craving and maintenance of abstinence. Document [26] states that low beta-endorphin levels are a possible indicator for craving in alcohol-dependent individuals and hence would be a potential target for anti-craving treatment. All these documents suggest that beta-endorphin deficiency is associated with alcohol withdrawal and contributes to anxiety and craving.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
