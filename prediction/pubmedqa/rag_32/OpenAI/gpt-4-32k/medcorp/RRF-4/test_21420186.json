    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that high levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a strong inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, are associated with the future development of adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death. The document also mentions that ADMA levels were reduced in ex-ELBW subjects compared to a control group, and significantly correlated inversely with gestational age and birth weight. This suggests that ADMA levels could be a predictor of early endothelial dysfunction in young adults born preterm. Document 2 also supports this, stating that ADMA was significantly higher in SGA and LGA children than AGA peers, suggesting that ADMA could be involved in the development of cardiometabolic alterations in these children. Document 3 also supports this, stating that urinary NGAL and hematic ADMA levels were higher in ex- ELBW subjects compared to a control group, suggesting a correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
