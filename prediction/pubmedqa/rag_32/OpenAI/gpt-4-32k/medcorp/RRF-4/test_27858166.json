    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] clearly states that the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of aortic injury. It mentions that the severity of Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch and there is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index. Document [17] also supports this by stating that width and height of the aortic arch directly contribute to the risk of developing traumatic non-penetrating aortic arch injury in severely injured patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
