    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents provide evidence that socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement. For instance, Document 2 mentions that socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase with age. Document 3 also suggests that income during retirement was more important for men's late-life mortality. Document 13 discusses that occupational differences in mortality and life expectancy persist after retirement and throughout life. Document 17 suggests that the disability retirement process leads to smaller socioeconomic differences in mortality compared with those generally found in the population. Document 25 also mentions that there are substantial differences in remaining life expectancy at higher ages between occupational groups, which persist after retirement. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that socioeconomic differences in mortality do persist after retirement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
