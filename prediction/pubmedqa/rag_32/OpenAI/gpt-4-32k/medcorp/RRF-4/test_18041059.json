    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what adjuvant aromatase inhibitors are. From the documents, I understand that they are a type of treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer. They work by reducing estrogen levels, which can help prevent the recurrence of breast cancer. Now, I need to determine whether these inhibitors increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients. Document [4] suggests that the risk of cardiovascular events is higher in patients receiving AIs compared to those receiving tamoxifen. However, Document [10] suggests that there is no substantial risk of ischemic cardiovascular events associated with adjuvant AI therapy. Document [18] also suggests that there were no significant differences in the risk of cardiovascular events between AI and tamoxifen users. Document [20] suggests that there is an increased risk for ischemic heart disease and arrhythmia in patients treated for more than four years with AIs. Document [24] suggests that AIs do not provide the cardioprotective effects of tamoxifen, and bone loss may be a concern with their long-term use. However, the overall rate of cardiovascular events in patients treated with AIs is within the range seen in age-matched, non-breast-cancer populations. Document [26] suggests that the majority of postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer had a predicted 10-year CVD risk that was equivalent to or higher than breast cancer recurrence risk. Therefore, the answer seems to be maybe, as the evidence is mixed and seems to depend on various factors such as the duration of treatment and the individual patient's health.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
