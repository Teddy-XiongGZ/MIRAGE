    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] directly addresses the question. It states that the relationships between leg muscle power and sprinting speed with changes of direction were not consistent. The correlations between muscle power and speed while changing direction were generally low and non-significant for concentric leg power. However, some moderate and significant coefficients were found for reactive strength. This suggests that while muscle power may play a role in running speed with changes of direction, it is not the sole or most significant factor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
