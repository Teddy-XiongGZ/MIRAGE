    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that a routinely inserted endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube did not improve the clinical course in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis after clearance of choledocholithiasis. The study found no significant differences in the recurrence rate of cholangitis and length of hospital stay between the group with ENBD and the group without. However, the procedure time was longer and the discomfort score was higher in the ENBD group. This suggests that routine insertion of an ENBD tube may not be necessary after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
