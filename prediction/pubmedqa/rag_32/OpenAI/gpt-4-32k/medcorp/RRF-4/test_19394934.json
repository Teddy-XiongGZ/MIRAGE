    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information on how hospitals, particularly in Israel, prepare for multiple casualty incidents related to terrorism. They discuss the concept of surge capacity, which is the ability of a hospital to handle a sudden influx of patients. The documents suggest that the current guidelines for readiness could be improved by considering a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentage of the hospital's bed capacity. They also suggest that only about 20% of arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. However, the documents do not provide a definitive answer on whether the surge capacity and injury severity distribution can be better predicted. They only suggest that improvements can be made in the current system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
