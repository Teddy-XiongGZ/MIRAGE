    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the accuracy of risk calculators in predicting surgical site occurrences. Some documents suggest that the calculators, such as the ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator, accurately predict certain outcomes (Documents 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 26, 29, 31). However, other documents indicate that these calculators often underestimate or overestimate the risk of surgical site occurrences and other complications (Documents 1, 4, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30). Therefore, while risk calculators can provide some guidance, their predictions are not always accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
