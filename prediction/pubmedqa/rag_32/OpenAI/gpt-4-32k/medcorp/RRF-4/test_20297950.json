    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] provides a proof-of-concept study on the effect of fenofibrate on sleep apnoea. The study found that fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced the percentage of time with SpO(2) <90%, reduced obstructive apnoeas, and non-cortical micro-awakenings per hour. However, it did not significantly change the AHI. The study concludes that the consistent direction of change in sleep indices may support further investigation of fenofibrate in moderate to severe sleep apnoea syndrome. Therefore, it can be inferred that fenofibrate may have a role in sleep apnoea syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
