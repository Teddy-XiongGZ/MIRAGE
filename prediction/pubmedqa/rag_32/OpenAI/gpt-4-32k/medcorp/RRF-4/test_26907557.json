Document [0] provides a clear answer to this question. It discusses a clinical study that investigated the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the TMJ. The study found that all patients (606 joints) had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA, with no severe complications and good esthetic and functional results. Therefore, it can be concluded that a novel surgical approach can indeed improve access and reduce complications in TMJ surgeries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
