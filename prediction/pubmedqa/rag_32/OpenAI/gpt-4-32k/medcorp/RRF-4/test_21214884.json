    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] indicates that 'high-risk' HPV types were not detected in human breast milk. However, Document [1] contradicts this by stating that high-risk HPV was identified in milk samples of 15% of normal lactating women. Document [2] also suggests that high-risk HPV types are rarely present in breast fluids. Document [3] detected high-risk HPV-16 in two of 80 samples of maternal milk. Document [4] discusses the inactivation of high-risk HPV in human milk through pasteurization, implying that high-risk HPV can be present in human milk. Document [10] and Document [14] also detected HPV DNA in breast milk. Document [8] suggests that breast milk is a potential vehicle for HPV transmission. Based on these documents, it seems that 'high-risk' HPVs can indeed be detected in human breast milk, although the prevalence may vary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
