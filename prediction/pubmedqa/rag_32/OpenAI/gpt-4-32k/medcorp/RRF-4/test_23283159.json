    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Many documents suggest that obesity is a risk factor for wheezing among adolescents. For example, Document [0] states that the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic individuals at 11 years. Document [1] also suggests that obesity was associated with an increased risk of wheezing in boys. Document [2] shows that obese girls had an increased risk of current wheezing. Document [3] suggests that obesity in girls was independently associated with increased risk of developing wheeze within four years. Document [4] suggests a possible positive bidirectional association between wheezing and obesity. Document [10] shows a strong association between asthma symptoms and both overweight and obesity in both sexes among school-age children. Document [12] suggests that low birth weight and maternal smoking in pregnancy are independent risk factors for early childhood wheezing, but in 85% of children with early wheezing it resolves by 16 years of age. Document [14] shows that overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for reduced lung function at school age after early childhood wheezing. Document [16] shows that early-onset asthma and wheezing may contribute to an increased risk of developing obesity in later childhood. Document [18] suggests that SDB and obesity each are associated with asthma and wheeze. Document [20] shows that overweight children conferred increased risks of incident asthma as compared with non-overweight children. Document [22] shows that overweight or obesity is a significant risk factor for childhood asthma and wheeze. Document [23] shows that overweight or obesity had no significant association with doctor-diagnosed or self-reported asthma, allergy or the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Document [24] shows that overweight children conferred increased risks of incident asthma as compared with non-overweight children. Document [26] shows that overweight or obesity is a significant risk factor for childhood asthma and wheeze. Document [27] shows that overweight or obesity had no significant association with doctor-diagnosed or self-reported asthma, allergy or the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Document [28] shows that overweight or obesity is a significant risk factor for childhood asthma and wheeze. Document [29] shows that overweight or obesity had no significant association with doctor-diagnosed or self-reported asthma, allergy or the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Document [30] shows that overweight or obesity is a significant risk factor for childhood asthma and wheeze. Document [31] shows that overweight or obesity had no significant association with doctor-diagnosed or self-reported asthma, allergy or the use of inhaled corticosteroids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
