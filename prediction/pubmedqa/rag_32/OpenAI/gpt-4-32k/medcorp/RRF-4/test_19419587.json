    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 suggests that sternal closure stability can be improved by adding plate fixation. Document 1 also suggests that primary sternal plating may reduce sternal wound complications in high-risk patients. Document 2 suggests that sternal plating is a feasible option for morbidly obese patients, who are otherwise at high risk of developing sternal dehiscence. Document 3 suggests that the transverse sternal plating system successfully achieved stability in all cases and is valuable in complex sternal reconstructions. Document 4 suggests that sternal plate reinforcement for sternotomy closure of patients with a body mass index 35 kg/m2 or greater produced no difference in postoperative sternal complication rates. Document 5 suggests that plating and interlocking techniques are superior to wiring in terms of stability and reduced rate of post-operative complications. Document 6 suggests that use of the Talon was associated with trends toward benefit in endpoints consistent with enhanced postoperative recovery. Document 7 suggests that titanium plate fixation is superior in stabilizing the sternal bone when compared with conventional refixation methods. Document 8 suggests that the use of the mesh plate device for sternal closure is simple, safe, easy, and potentially reliable without anterior-posterior sternal displacement. Document 9 suggests that the use of plate and wire fixation represents an alternate method to conventional techniques to achieve sternal closure, stability, and uncomplicated wound healing in these difficult-to-manage cases. Document 10 suggests that primary sternal closure with longitudinal wire reinforcement on both sides of the corpus sterni will decrease the risk of infection and improve wound-healing in parallel with a decrease in sternal dehiscence. Document 11 suggests that interlocking multitwisted wires the initial placement of the wire sutures is the same as in traditional sternal closure, however the twisting technique is improved, with multiple twisting including four twisted strands. Document 12 suggests that the system may be difficult and expensive to apply, but the positive results in most if not all the initial 28 patients appear to justify its use. Document 13 suggests that sternal dehiscence can be avoided by careful perioperative risk assessment and enhanced closure techniques. Document 14 suggests that the rate of postoperative infection and pain is not negligible. Thus, we recommend plate reconstruction only in sternal high-risk patients, who are unsuitable for standard reclosure. Document 15 suggests that new sternal closure methods probably make little or no difference regarding the prevention of sternal complications in the postoperative period when compared to the standard closure method. Document 16 suggests that primary sternal fixation is a simple and reliable method for prevention of postoperative mediastinitis development in high-risk patients. Document 17 suggests that sternal closure by rigid plate fixation contributes to a more rapid post-operative recovery through reduced pain. Document 18 suggests that the use of plates has been limited, in part, by insufficient knowledge about their most effective placement. Document 19 suggests that Flexigrip clips offered a stable alternative to steel wires in primary, as well as secondary sternal closure. Document 20 suggests that inadvertent paramedian sternomoty strongly affects postoperative chest wound stability independently from sternal size, requiring prompt reinforcement of chest closure. Document 21 suggests that rigid plate fixation was performed on 26 males and 19 females. The average age of patients was 63 (43-88) years. The average follow-up was 15 weeks (range 8-41 weeks). While there were 4 peri-operative deaths unrelated to sternal closure: one from aspiration pneumonia (post-operative day 9), one from a pulmonary embolus (post-operative day 29), one from overwhelming sepsis from pre-existing endocarditis (post-operative day 15), and one for primary respiratory failure (post-operative day 12). All others healed successfully. Document 22 suggests that sternal plating, which is based on the tension-band principle, is an effective treatment of sternal nonunion. The technique is applicable to both simple and complex nonunions. The stainless steel plates resist bending stresses, and the cortical bone resists compressive forces. The technique requires minimal dissection of the posterior sternal border, is not circumferential, and provides secure sternal approximation. Document 23 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability. Document 24 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability. Document 25 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability. Document 26 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability. Document 27 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability. Document 28 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability. Document 29 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability. Document 30 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability. Document 31 suggests that sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure can improve sternal stability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
