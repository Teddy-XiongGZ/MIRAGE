    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that apoptosis may not be involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Document [2] suggests that both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms are active within the same hippocampal neurons of patients with MTLE. Document [3] suggests that neuronal apoptosis occurs in mesial temporal sclerosis. Document [15] suggests that apoptosis may contribute to MTS, and seizures may induce apoptosis, and thus contribute to neuronal loss in MTS. Document [29] suggests that cell death in this rat model is related to the initial SE rather than to the frequency of spontaneous seizures. These results emphasize that it is of crucial importance to stop the SE as soon as possible to prevent extended cell loss and further progression of the disease. They also suggest that neuroprotectants can be useful during the first week after SE, but will not be very useful in the chronic epileptic phase. Based on these documents, it seems that there is evidence to suggest that apoptosis may be involved in cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis, but it may not be the only mechanism at play.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
