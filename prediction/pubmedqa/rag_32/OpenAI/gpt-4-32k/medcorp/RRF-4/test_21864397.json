    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that combined modality treatment, which includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can benefit patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lung metastasis alone. For instance, Document [0] states that the median post-metastasis survival (PMS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with combined therapy was significantly longer than that of those treated with chemotherapy alone. Similarly, Document [2] suggests that multimodality treatment may improve survival of select patients with recurrent NPC with distant metastases. Document [3] also suggests that a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy might have potential survival benefits. Therefore, the answer is yes, combined modality treatment does benefit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
