    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. For instance, Document [0] mentions that tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all healthy individuals, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. This suggests that tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure. Similarly, Document [8] mentions that clinical behavioral assessment improved in twelve patients (20%) after tDCS. This suggests that tDCS can have a direct causal effect on consciousness. Therefore, the answer is yes, tDCS can be useful in differentiating UWS from MCS patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
