    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that certain factors in residency selection criteria can predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. For instance, Document [0] found that USMLE Step 2 scores, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Document [1] found that academic achievements, letters of recommendation, and research activity were associated with outstanding residency performance. Document [2] found that the mean percentile score on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE), the percentile OITE score in the last year of training, USMLE score, Dean's letter, election to Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA), and number of honors in selected third-year clerkships predicted passing the ABOS Part I and Part II examinations. Therefore, it can be concluded that residency selection criteria can predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
