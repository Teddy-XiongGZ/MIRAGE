    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that minimally invasive mitral valve repair using artificial chords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. Document [1] suggests that the minimally invasive approach for complex mitral valve repair requires continued development and investigation, and current application should probably be largely restricted to high-volume reference minimally invasive surgery centers. Document [2] describes a novel method for artificial chordae replacement in mitral valve repair procedures that is simple, reproducible, and applicable to both anterior and posterior leaflets. Document [14] states that the method of performing mitral valve repair with neochord implantation has demonstrated superior durability over leaflet resection approaches with equivalent operative outcomes. Document [23] states that artificial chord implantation has become one of the most applied techniques for mitral valve repair. The use of artificial chords to achieve correct height adjustment of the prolapsing anterior leaflet segment can often be challenging. Document [24] states that minimally invasive mitral valve repair is based on several procedural concepts. Recently, three of them have been intensively discussed: aortic occlusion strategy, use of Goretex-Neo-Chordae to repair mitral valve regurgitation and feasibility and efficacy of the minithoracotomy approach in mitral valve treatment of patients after previous cardiac surgery. Document [30] suggests that a novel artificial papillary muscle could integrate with minimally invasive repairs to shorten the artificial chordae and behave as an elastic damper, thus reducing sharp increases in force. With this device, we have the potential to improve the durability of off-pump transapical mitral valve repair procedures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
