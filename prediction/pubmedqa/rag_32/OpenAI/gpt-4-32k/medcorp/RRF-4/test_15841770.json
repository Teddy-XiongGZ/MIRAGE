    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document states that inhaled steroids are better than cromones in preventing admissions for asthma. This is supported by the fact that total and first admissions, as well as hospital days, were clearly less in the province where more children were taking inhaled steroids. The third document also suggests that the use of inhaled corticosteroids increased substantially over the period and there is a potential for lowering admission rates. The seventh document also suggests that filling of inhaled steroids was associated with diminished hazard of early readmission. The eighteenth document also suggests that inhaled steroids and, to a lesser extent, cromolyn confer significant protection against exacerbations of asthma leading to hospitalization. Therefore, it can be concluded that inhaled steroids do differ from cromones in terms of hospital admission rates for asthma in children.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
