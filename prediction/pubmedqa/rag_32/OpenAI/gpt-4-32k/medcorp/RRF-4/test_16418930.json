    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if there are differences in visual acuity when measured with the Landolt C and Snellen E in patients with strabismus amblyopia. According to Document [0], differences between Landolt C acuity and Snellen E acuity were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. This indicates that there are slight differences in the measurements of visual acuity between the two methods in patients with strabismus amblyopia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
