    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that distal ureteral diameter (UD) and UD ratio (UDR) were significant predictors of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection. Document 1 also supports this, stating that UDR was a significant predictor of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection. Document 2 also supports the idea that distal ureteral dilatation is a decisive factor for clinical outcomes of primary VUR. Document 15 also mentions that UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears more predictive of clinical outcome than grade. Document 25 also supports this, stating that UDR correlates with reflux grade, and is predictive of early resolution in children with primary VUR. Document 28 also supports this, stating that UDR provides valuable prognostic information about risk of recurrent pyelonephritis and may assist with clinical decision-making. Therefore, the answer is yes, distal ureteral diameter can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
