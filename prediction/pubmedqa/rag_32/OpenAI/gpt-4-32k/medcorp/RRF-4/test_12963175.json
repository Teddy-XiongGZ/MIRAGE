    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the progression rate of aortic valve obstruction was found to be dependent on the degree of valvar calcification and to be exponentially correlated with the aortic valve opening area at initial catheterization. This suggests that the progression of asymptomatic aortic stenosis can be sufficiently predicted by the present aortic valve opening area and the degree of valvar calcification. Document [1] also supports this, stating that knowing the current reduction in transaortic gradient and the degree of calcification makes it possible to assess the likely progression of previously asymptomatic aortic valvar stenosis. Document [2] suggests that the rate of change in aortic valve area is an additional measure of disease severity and may be used to predict an individual's risk for subsequent rapid disease progression. These documents suggest that there are ways to predict the progression of valvar aortic stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
