    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 directly addresses the question and states that there is good correlation and agreement between end-tidal CO2 and arterial CO2 in ELBW infants in the EtCO2 range 30-50 mmHg. Document 1 also supports this, stating that there is a moderate agreement between noninvasive methods and PaCO2 in preterm infants in the first 24 hours. Document 2 further supports this, stating that end-tidal CO2 monitoring in NICU patients is as accurate as capillary or transcutaneous monitoring. Document 4 also states that the correlation between mainstream ETCO2 and PaCO2 is good. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
