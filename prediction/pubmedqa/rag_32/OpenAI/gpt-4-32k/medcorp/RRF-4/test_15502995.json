    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the theory that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait independent of the type of drug could not be confirmed. However, Document [1] mentions that early prescribers of one new drug were not early prescribers of the other new drugs, indicating that there are indeed early adopters of drugs, but their adoption does not necessarily apply to all types of drugs. Document [4] also supports this by stating that early adoption of new drugs is not a personal trait, independent of drug type, but early adopters share both micro- and meso-level characteristics. Therefore, it can be concluded that early adopters of drugs do exist, but their adoption is not a personal trait and does not apply to all types of drugs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
