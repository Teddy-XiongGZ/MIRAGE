    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document mentions a study that aimed to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately differentiate free-floating intraluminal thrombus (FFT) from atherosclerotic plaque. The study found that five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 \u00b1 0.09. This suggests that shape analysis can indeed differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
