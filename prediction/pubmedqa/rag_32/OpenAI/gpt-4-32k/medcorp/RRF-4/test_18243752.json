    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents present mixed views on whether chest wall irradiation should be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer. Some studies suggest that chest wall irradiation can reduce the risk of local recurrence and improve survival rates, especially in patients with certain risk factors such as age under 40 years and larger tumor size (Document 0). However, other studies argue that chest wall irradiation may not be necessary for all patients, especially those without certain risk factors such as vascular invasion (Document 1). Therefore, the decision to include chest wall irradiation after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer may depend on the individual patient's risk factors and overall health status.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
