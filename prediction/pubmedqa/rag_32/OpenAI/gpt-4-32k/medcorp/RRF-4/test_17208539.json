    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a comparison of the long-term results of the transanal pull-through and the transabdominal pull-through for Hirschsprung's disease. Document [0] indicates that the continence score was significantly better in the abdominal group, but the stool pattern score was better in the transanal group. Document [1] suggests that nearly 15% of all patients operated with transanal pull-through continue to experience persistent bowel symptoms with constipation as the main problem. Document [2] shows that the overall scores were similar for both techniques, but the incidence of incontinence was insignificantly lower in the abdominal group. Document [13] suggests that the long-term outcomes of the modified transanal procedure are generally better than those obtained with classical approaches. Document [23] indicates that the clinical outcome is satisfactory for both techniques. Document [27] suggests that the clinical outcome is satisfactory with no significant difference between the two techniques. Document [30] indicates that the postoperative stay was significantly reduced in the laparoscopic group, which is a form of transanal pull-through. Based on these documents, it seems that the long-term results of the transanal pull-through are not exactly equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through, as there are differences in certain aspects such as continence score, stool pattern score, and postoperative stay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
