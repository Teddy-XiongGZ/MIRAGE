    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that there is little overlap between regions of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) during atrial fibrillation (AF) and regions of sinus rhythm fractionation (SRF). It also mentions that the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target. Document 13 also supports this by stating that in patients with a history of AF, EGM fractionation can occur at amplitudes > 0.5 mV when in SR in areas often considered not to be diseased tissue. Document 18 also states that areas of CFAEs correspond to areas of normal atrial voltage and normal conduction velocity during NSR. Thus, AF CFE sites do not necessarily identify regions of an abnormal atrial substrate. Therefore, the answer is no, there is no significant relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
