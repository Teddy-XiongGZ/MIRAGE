    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. Document [1] suggests that high levels of pain intensity, often due to previous undertreatment, are predictive of more complex analgesic treatment. However, it does not directly link pain intensity to poor opioid response. Document [3] mentions that several factors can interfere with an appropriate analgesic opioid response, but it does not specifically mention pain intensity as a factor. Document [23] suggests that pain intensity at initial assessment is a significant predictor of pain management complexity and length of time to stable pain control. However, it does not directly link high pain intensity to poor opioid response. Document [26] suggests that pain intensity at the time of opioid initiation could be a predictor of opioid resistance, but it does not directly link high pain intensity to poor opioid response. Document [28] suggests that the complete lack of early response to opioids in cancer patients is clinically important and more frequent than expected. However, it does not directly link high pain intensity to poor opioid response. Document [29] suggests that age, neuropathic pain, and alkaline phosphatase were significant factors for opioid resistance, but it does not directly link high pain intensity to poor opioid response. Document [31] suggests that primary cancer may have an influence on pain characteristics and opioid response, but it does not directly link high pain intensity to poor opioid response. Overall, while some documents suggest that high pain intensity may be associated with more complex analgesic treatment or longer time to achieve stable pain control, none of the documents directly link high pain intensity to poor opioid response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
