    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that anticoagulation can be resumed after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it should be done carefully. Document [4] states that resuming oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy does not increase the risk of recurrent ICH and can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. However, the timing of resumption is still unknown and should be decided after a careful assessment of risks for ICH recurrence and thromboembolism. Document [7] suggests that survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation. Document [9] found that postdischarge use of oral anticoagulation therapy was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and thromboembolic events and no increased risk of major bleeding. Therefore, the answer is not a simple yes or no, but rather it depends on the individual patient's condition and risk factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
