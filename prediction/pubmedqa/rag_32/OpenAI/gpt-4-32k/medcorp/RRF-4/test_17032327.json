    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 1 directly addresses the question and states that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants. This is supported by Document 14 which states that in selected patients, it is appropriate for supervised trainees to perform colorectal resection. Document 18 also supports this by stating that supervised trainees can perform emergency colorectal surgery with similar outcomes to their consultants. Document 25 also mentions that standardised supervised training of laparoscopic colorectal cancer procedures to specialist surgeons may not adversely impact short- and long-term outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
