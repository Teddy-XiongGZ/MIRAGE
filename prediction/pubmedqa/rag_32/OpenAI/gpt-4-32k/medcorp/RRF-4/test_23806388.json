    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that nomograms are used to predict the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after treatments like radical prostatectomy. However, it's also mentioned that these nomograms can predict more definitive endpoints such as prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and aggressive BCR. In fact, some studies show that these nomograms predict PCSM and other clinically relevant endpoints more accurately than they predict BCR. Therefore, it can be concluded that nomograms do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
