    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] suggests that comorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer subsequent MD outcomes. Furthermore, those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly higher rates of adult MD than those in the AUD-only group, and marginally higher rates of adult MD than those in the MD-only group. Document [2] also indicates that compared to pure disorders, MDD+AUD was associated with higher risk of alcohol dependence, suicide attempt, lower global functioning, and life dissatisfaction. Document [16] suggests that the comorbid presence of MDD is associated with an earlier relapse to alcohol use among adolescents with an AUD. Document [19] also supports the association between depressive disorders and AUD, beginning early in life. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
