    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] and Document [1] both discuss the influence of the sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery on distal embolisation. Document [0] suggests that there is no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs. Document [1] suggests that initial distal clamping minimises distal embolisation, but may result in renal and/or visceral embolisation. Initial proximal clamping prevents proximal embolisation and does not promote distal embolisation. Therefore, the sequence of clamp application does not seem to influence distal embolisation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
