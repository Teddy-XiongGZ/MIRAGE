    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that zeolite hemostatic agents can be beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial injury. For instance, Document [0] states that the application of a zeolite mineral led to decreased total blood loss in a swine extremity arterial injury model. Document [1] also mentions that a zeolite-based hemostatic agent can control severe hemorrhage. Document [2] further supports this by stating that the use of a zeolite hemostatic agent can control hemorrhage and dramatically reduce mortality from a lethal groin wound. However, it's important to note that while these studies show the potential benefits of zeolite hemostatic agents, they also highlight the need for further clinical trials to confirm these findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
