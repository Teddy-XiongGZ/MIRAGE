    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a comparison between the deflation rates of prefilled textured saline breast implants and standard textured saline breast implants. According to Document [0], there is a statistically significant difference in the deflation rates of these two types of implants. The cumulative deflation rates of the Poly Implant Prosthesis implants (prefilled textured saline breast implants) were higher than those of the Mentor implants (standard textured saline implants) at year 2, year 3, and year 4. Therefore, the answer is yes, there is a difference in deflation rates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
