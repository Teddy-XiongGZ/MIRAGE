Many of them compared the effects of regional anesthesia and general anesthesia in geriatric patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Some studies suggested that regional anesthesia might be associated with lower postoperative complications, shorter hospital stays, and improved pain control. However, other studies found no significant difference in postoperative morbidity, mortality, or hospitalization costs between the two anesthesia methods. Therefore, the evidence is mixed and does not conclusively support one method over the other in terms of decreasing morbidity, mortality, and health care costs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
