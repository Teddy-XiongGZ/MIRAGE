    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that calprotectin, a protein complex present in inflammatory cells, can be measured in stool samples and act as a biomarker for bowel inflammation. Multiple studies have shown that patients who relapse have significantly higher levels of calprotectin in their stool compared with non-relapsers, especially in ulcerative colitis. Elevated faecal calprotectin postoperatively in Crohn's disease was also shown to be indicative of a relapse. Therefore, it can be concluded that calprotectin can predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
