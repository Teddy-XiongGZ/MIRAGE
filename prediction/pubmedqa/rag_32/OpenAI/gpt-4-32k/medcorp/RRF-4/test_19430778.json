    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in predicting concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection. Some documents, such as Document [0], suggest that certain MRI findings, like disc protrusion with a high intensity zone (HIZ), can significantly correlate with concordant pain provocation. However, other documents, like Document [24], suggest that MRI findings do not always correlate with pain provocation during discography. Document [30] also suggests that only certain MRI features, like disc desiccation, can successfully predict the result of discography. Therefore, while MRI can sometimes predict concordant pain provocation, it is not always accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
