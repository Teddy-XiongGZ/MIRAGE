    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document for this question is Document [0]. According to this document, the amount of space closure was very similar between the three groups (1 mm per 28 days); however, there was a wide variation in the rate of space closure between individuals. The differences in the amount of space closure over three months between the three groups was very small and non-significant (P = 0\u00b7718). The hypothesis that reducing friction by modifying the bracket/ligature interface increases the rate of space closure was not supported. The major determinant of orthodontic tooth movement is probably the individual patient response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
