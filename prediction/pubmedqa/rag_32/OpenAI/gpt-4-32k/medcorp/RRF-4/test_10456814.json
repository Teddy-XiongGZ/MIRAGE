    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document clearly states that desflurane is effective in controlling intraoperative hypertension without causing major cardiac depressant effects. It also mentions that no change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when desflurane was added to restore blood pressure. This suggests that desflurane does not significantly alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
