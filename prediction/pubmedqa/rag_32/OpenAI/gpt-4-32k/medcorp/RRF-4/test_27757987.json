    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether the treatment of amblyopia normalizes subfoveal choroidal thickness in amblyopic children. Document [0] states that although a six-month treatment of amblyopia increased the visual acuity of the anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic eyes, it could not significantly change choroidal thickness. Document [1] suggests that wearing corrective lenses improves visual acuity and induces changes in the subfoveal choroidal thickness in eyes with anisohypermetropic amblyopia. However, it does not specify whether this change leads to normalization. Document [2] indicates that choroidal thickness at all locations decreased significantly after treatment in the amblyopic eyes. However, it does not specify whether this decrease leads to normalization. Document [16] suggests that the choroidal structural change induced by 1% atropine instillation was smaller for the amblyopic eye than the fellow eye in children with hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia. However, it does not specify whether this change leads to normalization. Document [24] states that although visual acuity in amblyopic eyes was significantly improved after treatment, the choroid thickening of anisometropic amblyopic eyes persisted, and there was no significant change found in the choroidal thickness after the treatment. Based on these documents, it seems that while treatment may induce some changes in choroidal thickness, it does not necessarily lead to normalization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
