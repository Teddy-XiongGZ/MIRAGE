    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The SYNTAX score is a grading system that evaluates the complexity and prognosis of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Document [1] states that a high SYNTAX score is a predictor of adverse outcomes for stable and unstable coronary syndromes. Document [0] also states that the SYNTAX score is associated with 30-day mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Document [2] confirms that the SYNTAX score provides prognostic information for patients undergoing PPCI for STEMI. Document [14] states that the SYNTAX score is an independent predictor of short-term cardiac mortality in patients with acute STEMI. Document [19] states that the SYNTAX score is an independent predictor of both in-hospital and long-term mortality and MACE in patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Document [30] states that the SYNTAX II score is a useful tool for risk stratification and prediction of 4-year mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. All these documents support that the SYNTAX score can predict in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
