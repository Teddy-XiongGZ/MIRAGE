    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks whether the risk factors for suicidal behavior differ based on the polarity of affective disorders. Affective disorders refer to conditions such as depression and bipolar disorder, and polarity refers to whether the disorder is characterized by mania (high mood) or depression (low mood). Document [0] states that 'Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders.' This suggests that the risk factors for suicidal behavior do not differ by affective disorder polarity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
