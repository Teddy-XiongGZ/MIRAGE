    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking if it's possible to get correlated results from homebrew assays when detecting BCRABL transcripts using quantitative real-time PCR. Looking at the documents, Document [0] specifically discusses this topic. It mentions that despite significant differences in methodologies, quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. This suggests that even with homebrew assays, it's possible to get correlated results.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
