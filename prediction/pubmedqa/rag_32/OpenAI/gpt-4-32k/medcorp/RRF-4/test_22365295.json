    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether prophylactic antibiotics are necessary when placing a totally implantable venous access device by interventional radiologists. Document [0] states that the rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is less than 1%. Based on these data, the use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended. Document [1] also concludes that they do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics in TIVAD insertion because they will not decrease the already low rate of postoperative infectious complications. Document [2] also concludes that ending the practice of administrating systemic antibiotic prophylaxis prior to the placement of TIVADs had no effect on the 30-day bloodstream infection-related TIVAD removals rate at their institution. They do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics for the placement of TIVAD. Document [3] also concludes that routine use of prophylactic antibiotics with TIVAD placement should be avoided. Document [4] also concludes that the odds ratio of infection was 0.85 with antibiotic use but one was contained within the confidence interval suggesting no significant difference in infection rate when antibiotics were used. Document [13] also concludes that single-shot periinterventional prophylactic antibiosis can reduce early and late infectious complications after radiological-interventional placement of central venous port catheters. Document [27] also concludes that prophylactic antibiotic use was higher in the chest (79.3% vs. 1.50%, p-value < 0.0001), infection rates did not differ. Document [29] also concludes that the study suggests that, following strict methods of pre- and postoperative care, TIVADs in patients with solid tumors may be surgically implanted without any antibiotic prophylaxis. Document [31] also concludes that low-profile chest ports placed by interventional radiologists in the interventional radiology suite can be placed in children as safely as traditional chest ports placed operatively. The incidence of infection, venous thrombosis and aspiration occlusion is comparable to that of ports placed operatively.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
