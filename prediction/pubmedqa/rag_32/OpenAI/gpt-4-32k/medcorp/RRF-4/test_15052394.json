    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms. Document [1] also indicates that differences between men and women in the number of symptoms reported could not account for the difference in rates of depression. Document [2] suggests that when alternative symptoms are considered, sex disparities in the prevalence of depression are eliminated. Document [3] shows that depressed women were more likely to report 'appetite/weight disturbance', whereas depressed men were more likely to report 'alcohol misuse' and 'substance misuse'. Document [4] suggests that differences in the experience and reporting of somatic symptoms would not likely explain gender differences in depression rates and symptom severity. Document [14] suggests that the gender difference in the prevalence of depression results from the higher prevalence among women of a specific phenotype, somatic depression. Document [23] suggests that the gender difference in depression may result from a difference in a specific type of depression-anxious somatic depression. Document [24] suggests that gender bias within the family may contribute to the higher recorded rates of depression in women. Document [25] suggests that women are more likely than men to have atypical symptoms of depression. Document [29] suggests that further research is needed to determine a convincing explanation for women's greater susceptibility to depression. Based on these documents, it seems that the higher rates of depression in women are not solely accounted for by differential symptom reporting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
