    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide conflicting information on whether the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp can predict a neoplastic polyp. Document [0] states that the growth rate was not related to the neoplastic nature of a polyp. However, Document [1] suggests that the growth rate during follow-up is associated with neoplastic polyps. Document [2] also states that the growth status was not a valuable modality to distinguishing gallbladder adenomas from cholesterol polyps. Therefore, it seems that the growth rate alone may not be a reliable predictor for neoplastic polyps.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
