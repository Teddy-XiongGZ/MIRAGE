    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that steep posterior tibial slopes are associated with failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. For instance, Document [1] states that the most accurate predictor of ACL failure was a lateral posterior tibial slope greater than 7.4\u00b0. Document [2] also mentions that increased posterior tibial slope has been shown to increase forces on the native and reconstructed ACL, and has been demonstrated in patients with failed ACL reconstruction. Document [4] suggests that increased posterior tibial slope is a risk factor for failure following ACL reconstruction. Document [8] concludes that both medial and lateral posterior tibial slopes were significantly steeper in failures of ACL reconstruction than the control group. Document [15] states that an increased posterior tibial slope is associated with increased odds of a further ACL injury after ACL reconstruction. Document [22] also mentions that increased posterior tibial slope was associated with increased risk of graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury after revision ACL reconstruction. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
