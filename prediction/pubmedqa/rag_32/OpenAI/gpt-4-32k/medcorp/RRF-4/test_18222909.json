    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] directly addresses the question. It states that the hypothesis was tested that pectin content and methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens. This suggests that pectins are indeed involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed rape plants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
