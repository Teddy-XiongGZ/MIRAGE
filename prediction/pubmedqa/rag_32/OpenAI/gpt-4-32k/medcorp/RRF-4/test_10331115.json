    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amoxapine is primarily marketed as an antidepressant. However, several documents suggest that it has properties similar to atypical antipsychotics. For instance, Document [0] and Document [1] suggest that amoxapine has shown efficacy as an atypical antipsychotic in trials. Document [3] also supports this by stating that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of established atypical antipsychotics. Document [4] mentions that amoxapine may behave as an atypical antipsychotic and may be used in the treatment of schizophrenia off-label. Therefore, while it is not primarily classified as an atypical antipsychotic, it appears to have properties and effects similar to those of atypical antipsychotics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
