    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] clearly states that ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. This is supported by the results of a retrospective cohort study. Other documents also support this finding, for example, document [1] states that Spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) leads to earlier detection of glomerular damage leading to prompt management of preeclamptic patients. Document [3] suggests that an ACR threshold of 9 mg/mmol on a morning urine sample can be used to detect significant proteinuria of preeclampsia in hospitalized hypertensive women. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
