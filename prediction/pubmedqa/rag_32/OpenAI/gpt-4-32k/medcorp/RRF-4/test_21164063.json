    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fondaparinux is a synthetic selective factor Xa inhibitor used for venous thromboembolism prevention and treatment. Its use as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored in the documents. The documents suggest that fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. However, in some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients. The role of fondaparinux in perioperative bridge therapy has not been established, and there are some important limitations to its use as a routine bridging agent. Therefore, the answer is maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
