    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that an overweight birth cohort in childhood does not necessarily continue to be overweight in young adulthood. Document [2] and [3] suggest that overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults, but not all overweight children become overweight adults. Document [4] also supports this, stating that about a third of obese preschool children were obese as adults, and about half of obese school-age children were obese as adults. Therefore, while there is a higher likelihood for overweight children to become overweight adults, it is not a certainty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
