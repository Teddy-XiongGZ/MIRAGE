    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what spinal cord sarcoidosis and compressive cervical myelopathy are. Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystem noncaseating granulomatous disease, and it can affect the spinal cord. Compressive cervical myelopathy is a condition where the spinal cord in the neck is compressed. Now, I need to look at the documents to see if decompressive surgery is effective for this condition. Document [0] states that the effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive myelopathy was not evident. Document [1] also states that laminoplasty, a type of decompressive surgery, is not an effective intervention for the treatment of spinal cord sarcoidosis. Therefore, based on these documents, it seems that decompressive surgery is not effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
