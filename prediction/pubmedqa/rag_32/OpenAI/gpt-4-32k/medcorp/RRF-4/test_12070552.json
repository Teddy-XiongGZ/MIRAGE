    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a lot of information about the use of antibiotics in post-tonsillectomy care. Many of the studies, such as those in documents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, and 31, suggest that antibiotics do not significantly reduce post-tonsillectomy morbidity, including pain, need for analgesia, and secondary haemorrhage rates. Some studies found that antibiotics may reduce the incidence of fever, but this benefit is not consistent across all studies. A few studies, like the one in document 13, found that antibiotics may have a limited benefit in reducing postoperative morbidity, but this benefit may be due to bias in the study design. Therefore, the majority of the evidence suggests that antibiotics do not decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
