    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS. Document 1 suggests that women with dense breasts are more likely to need additional surgery (re-excision after breast-conserving surgery). Document 3 also suggests that mammographic density is an additional risk factor for a second operation following breast-conserving procedures. Document 4 suggests that breast density was not associated with positive margins or conversion to mastectomy. Document 12 suggests that high mammographic density is an independent risk factor of local and locoregional recurrence but is neither associated with distant metastasis nor survival. Document 13 suggests that mammographic breast density is an important risk factor for local breast cancer recurrence among women not receiving breast irradiation. Document 21 suggests that lower BMI, larger tumor size, pathologic evidence of multifocal disease, and no preoperative MRI evaluation were associated with increased risk for positive surgical margin involvement. Document 24 suggests that microcalcifications, grade 4 mammographic density, >0.5 cm difference in tumor size between magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography, DCIS on needle biopsy, and lobular component on needle biopsy were independent predictors of positive resection margins. Document 26 suggests that microcalcifications, grade 4 mammographic density, >0.5 cm difference in tumor size between magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography, DCIS on needle biopsy, and lobular component on needle biopsy were independent predictors of positive resection margins. Document 29 suggests that shaving does not significantly decrease the re-excision rate but provides wider clear margins in most procedures. It ensures more accurate margin examination and decreases false-positive margin rate, without any increase in removed breast-tissue volume. Document 30 suggests that oncoplastic techniques extend breast-conserving surgery to patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy response unfit for conventional techniques. The surgical approach combining oncoplastic techniques with bracketing allows breast-conserving surgery to be performed in these patients. Document 31 suggests that re-excision rates did not significantly decline before and after 2014 guideline adoption (11.9% before, 10.9% after; p = 0.65) or when the 2016 guidelines were retrospectively applied (8.4%; p = 0.10). The 2014 and 2016 guidelines had minimal impact on our re-excision rates, as most re-excisions were done for DCIS and 2016 guidelines supported our prior institutional practices of 2 mm margins for these patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
