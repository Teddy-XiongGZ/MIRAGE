    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 and Document 1 both discuss the use of the STANDING diagnostic tool by emergency physicians (EPs) to diagnose the central cause of vertigo in patients. The studies found that the tool had high sensitivity and specificity, and good inter-observer agreement when used by EPs. Document 8 discusses the use of the HINTS examination by emergency physicians to rule out stroke in patients presenting with acute vestibular syndrome. The study found that when used in isolation by emergency physicians, the HINTS examination has not been shown to be sufficiently accurate to rule out a stroke. However, Document 10 found that both HINTS and STANDING tests outperformed the ABCD2 score in identifying central causes of vertigo when used by EPs. Therefore, it seems that while there may be some limitations, emergency physicians can accurately and reliably assess acute vertigo in the emergency department using certain diagnostic tools.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
