    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether Indigenous Australians age prematurely, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] states that there is no consistent pattern of a 20-year lead in age-specific prevalence of age-associated conditions for Indigenous compared with other Australians. Document [2] mentions that the health status of Indigenous populations of Australia manifests as life expectancies substantially lower than the total population.
