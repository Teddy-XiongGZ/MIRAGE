    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone is not accurate in predicting concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection. Document [0] states that disc protrusion with a high intensity zone (HIZ) on MRI predicted positive discography in patients with discogenic low back pain, but a normal or bulging disc with HIZ was not associated with reproduction of pain. Document [5] also mentions that MRI findings such as disc degeneration and a high-signal-intensity zone were not helpful in identifying symptomatic disc derangement. Additionally, document [17] states that the positive predictive value of lumbar spine MRI findings for a painful disc using provocative discography is variable depending on the specific MRI finding. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
