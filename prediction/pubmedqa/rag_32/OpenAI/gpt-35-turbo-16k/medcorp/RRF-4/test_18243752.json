    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether chest wall irradiation should be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer, we need to consider the relevant documents. Document [0] suggests that post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be discussed for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of local failure such as age \u2264 40 years and larger tumor size. Document [2] discusses the significance of radiation therapy for patients with positive/close margins after mastectomy, but it does not specifically address negative node breast cancer. Document [4] states that a close or positive margin after mastectomy is not an indication for chest wall irradiation except in women aged fifty or younger. Document [6] shows that adjuvant radiotherapy of the chest wall following mastectomy reduces the risk of local recurrence in node-negative patients with pT1-T2 tumors but has no impact on the overall survival rate. Based on these documents, it seems that chest wall irradiation may be considered for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of local failure, but it is not necessary for all patients with negative node breast cancer. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
