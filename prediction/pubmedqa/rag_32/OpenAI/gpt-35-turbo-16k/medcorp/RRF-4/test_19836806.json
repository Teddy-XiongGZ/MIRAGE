    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether prostate specific antigen (PSA) should be adjusted for body mass index (BMI), we need to examine the relationship between BMI and PSA levels. Looking at the relevant documents, we find conflicting results. Some studies suggest that there is an inverse relationship between BMI and PSA levels, indicating that higher BMI is associated with lower PSA levels. Other studies show no significant correlation between BMI and PSA levels. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether PSA should be adjusted for BMI. However, since there is no clear consensus and conflicting results, the answer is 'maybe' (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
