    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it can be concluded that sternal plating can improve sternal stability. Document [0] states that adding a single sternal plate to primary closure improves the strength of sternal closure with traditional wiring, potentially reducing the risk of sternal dehiscence. Document [1] also supports this, stating that sternal closure with rigid titanium plates may reduce sternal wound complications. Document [2] further confirms the feasibility of primary sternal plating for improving sternal closure in high-risk patients. Additionally, Document [3] mentions that transverse rib-to-rib stabilization with titanium plates designed for sternal fixation is a recent option that successfully achieves stability in sternal reconstructions. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
