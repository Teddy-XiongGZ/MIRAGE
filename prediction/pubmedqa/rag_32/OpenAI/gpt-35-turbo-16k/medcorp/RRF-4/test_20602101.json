    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, hypoalbuminemia is associated with decreased survival in patients with gastric cancer. However, the prognostic value of albumin may be secondary to the presence of a systemic inflammatory response. Document [0] states that on multivariate analysis, albumin was no longer an independent predictor of survival. Document [2] also mentions that hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse survival in patients with gastric cancer, but the prognostic significance is found in patients with cancer in the lower stomach. Therefore, based on the available evidence, hypoalbuminemia is not an independent prognostic factor in all patients with gastric cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
