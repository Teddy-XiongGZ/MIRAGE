    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence. Document [3] also supports this finding, stating that routine prophylactic postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after elective gastrectomy. Document [6] provides a systematic analysis of 4,888 patients and concludes that the risk of leak after LSG is low at 2.4%. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that nasogastric decompression is not useful in preventing leaks after LSG.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
