    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence suggesting that adjuvant aromatase inhibitors may increase the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Document [4] reports that the use of aromatase inhibitors is associated with a greater number of cardiovascular events compared to tamoxifen. Document [8] mentions that postmenopausal women receiving aromatase inhibitors are at risk for age-related changes in lipid parameters and an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Document [19] also suggests an increased risk for ischemic heart disease and arrhythmia in patients treated with aromatase inhibitors for more than four years. However, it is important to note that other documents mention that the overall safety of aromatase inhibitors in terms of cardiovascular events is similar to tamoxifen or within the range seen in age-matched, non-breast-cancer populations. Therefore, while there is some evidence suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk, it is not definitive. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
