    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents and look for evidence comparing bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BKA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in terms of knee muscle strength and physical performance. Document [0] states that although bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was theoretically plausible to be superior, it was not found to be superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty at 1 year. Document [1] suggests that medial bicompartmental arthroplasty results in improved gait and subjective outcomes compared to total knee arthroplasty. Document [2] indicates that total knee arthroplasty had better short-term results in terms of patient recorded outcome measures compared to bicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Document [3] states that bicompartmental knee arthroplasty did not show a functional advantage over total knee arthroplasty. Based on these findings, the answer to the question is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
