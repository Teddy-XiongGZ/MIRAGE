    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, decisional algorithms are not able to replace global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs. The documents state that decisional algorithms have high rates of sensitivity but low rates of specificity, meaning they are good at detecting ADRs but not as good at determining if a report is truly drug-related. The documents also mention that algorithms do not replace global introspection and are not definite alternatives in the individual causality assessment of suspected ADRs. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
