    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it can be concluded that cavitation in proximal surfaces should be reported in cone beam computed tomography examination. Document [0] states that CBCT was more accurate in detecting cavitation in proximal surfaces than bitewing radiographs, and it suggests that when a CBCT examination is performed for other clinical applications, proximal surface cavities should also be assessed and reported. Document [1] also supports this conclusion, stating that CBCT was much more accurate in the detection of surface cavitation in approximal surfaces than intraoral receptors. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
