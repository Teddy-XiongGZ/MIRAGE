    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is indicated that major trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. Neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hours of admission. This enhanced neutrophil migratory activity, coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8, may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma is a factor in the etiology of ARDS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
