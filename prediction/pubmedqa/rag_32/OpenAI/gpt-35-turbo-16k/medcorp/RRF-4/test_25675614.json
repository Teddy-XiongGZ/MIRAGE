    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, gingival crevicular blood (GCB) can be relied upon for assessment of blood glucose level. Multiple studies have shown a strong correlation between GCB and finger-prick blood glucose levels, with high correlation coefficients ranging from 0.8153 to 0.997. The studies also indicate that GCB can be a feasible and useful primary screening tool for detecting diabetes and estimating blood glucose levels in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The data from these studies support the reliability of GCB for assessing blood glucose levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
