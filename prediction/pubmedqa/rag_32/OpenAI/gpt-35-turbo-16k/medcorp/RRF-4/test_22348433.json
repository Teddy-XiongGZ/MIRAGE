    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant documents that discuss the impact of partial expander deflation and radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction. Document [1] titled 'Does partial expander deflation exacerbate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction?' specifically addresses this question. The study conducted on rabbits divided into three groups found that partial expander deflation immediately prior to radiotherapy resulted in increased skin blood flow and aggravated findings of chronic radiodermatitis, especially around the lower expander pole. This suggests that partial expander deflation may indeed exacerbate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
