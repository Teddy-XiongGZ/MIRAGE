    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is evident that knowledge of estimated fetal weight (EFW) obtained by ultrasound is associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery. Document [0] states that knowledge of ultrasound-obtained estimated fetal weight (US-EFW) is a risk factor for cesarean delivery. Document [1] also supports this finding, stating that systematic fetal weight estimation by ultrasound in the delivery room increases the risk of cesarean delivery. Document [5] further confirms this association, stating that documentation of estimated fetal weight, obtained clinically or by ultrasound, is associated with increased odds of cesarean delivery. Therefore, the answer to the question is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
