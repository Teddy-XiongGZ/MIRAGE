    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people are socially imbalanced, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] provides information on the acceptance rates of preventive home visits among older people in Denmark. According to the study, older persons with high financial assets accepted preventive home visits more frequently than persons with low assets. However, the association between socioeconomic status and acceptance rates was attenuated when adjusted by the invitational procedures. The study suggests that the social inequality in acceptance of preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that acceptance rates of the preventive home visit programme for older people are socially imbalanced.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
