    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document [0] compares left ventricular regional wall motion before and after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients. The study found that left ventricular wall motion in the five regions did not differ between pre- and postoperative measurements. Therefore, the answer is no, quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion does not change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
