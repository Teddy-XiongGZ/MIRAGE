    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant documents that discuss the familial transmission of drinking patterns. Document [0] explores the long-term transmission of familial drinking during adolescence to offspring drinking patterns in young adulthood. It suggests that changes in the lower part of the familial drinking distribution are strongly related to drinking in young adults, but the actual levels of drinking in drinking families appear less important in shaping the drinking patterns of the offspring in young adulthood. Document [2] also examines the role of family formation and dissolution in shaping drinking behavior in early adulthood and finds that stability and change in drinking between adolescence and early adulthood are associated with family formation patterns. Document [4] supports the hypothesis that parents' drinking patterns may influence the drinking patterns of the offspring as adults. Based on these findings, it is reasonable to conclude that the familial transmission of drinking patterns does persist into young adulthood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
