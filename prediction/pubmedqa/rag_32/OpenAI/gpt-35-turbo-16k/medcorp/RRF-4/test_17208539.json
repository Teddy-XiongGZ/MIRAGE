    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents and compare the long-term outcomes of the transanal pull-through (TERPT) and the transabdominal pull-through (ABD) procedures for Hirschsprung's disease (HD). Document [0] compared the long-term outcomes of TERPT and ABD pull-through and found that the overall scores were similar, but the continence score was significantly better in the ABD group. Document [1] conducted a meta-analysis of studies on TAPT for HD and found that 14.2% of patients had disturbances of bowel function, with 53.3% experiencing constipation. Document [2] also compared the outcomes of TERPT and ABD pull-through and found that overall scores were similar, but the soiling score tended to be significantly more severe after TERPT. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the long-term results of the transanal pull-through are not equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
