    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the present study (Document [0]) suggests that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure. The study found that nude mice (which are T-cell deficient) exposed to toluene showed a longer escape latency and poor retention memory compared to wild-type mice. This indicates that T-cell deficiency may have an impact on spatial learning performance after toluene exposure. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
