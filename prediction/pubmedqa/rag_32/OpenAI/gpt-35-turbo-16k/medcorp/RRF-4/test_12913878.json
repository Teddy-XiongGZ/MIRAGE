    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in Document [0], Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) induces an opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and allows the passage of paclitaxel across the disrupted BBB. This suggests that locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy could be a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
