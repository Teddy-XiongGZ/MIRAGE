    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether antibiotics decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] states that postoperative antibiotics had no role in pain control, postoperative fever, secondary hemorrhage, or reduction in hospital stay. Document [1] found that antibiotics did not reduce post-operative morbidity in children. Document [2] states that there is no evidence to support a consistent, clinically important impact of antibiotics in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity. Document [3] also concludes that there is no evidence to support the routine prescription of antibiotics to patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Document [4] states that the use of antibiotics did not show a significant decrease in post-operative complications. Based on these findings, the answer is B. no, antibiotics do not decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
