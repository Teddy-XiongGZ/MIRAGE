    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the influence of otolith organs input on the horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex is mentioned. Document [0] states that the axis of the eyeball rotation is affected by the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head, indicating that otolith organs input influences the axis of the horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex. Document [1] also suggests that physiologic alteration of the vestibulo-ocular reflex using deliberately mismatched visual and semicircular canal stimuli induces changes in both canal-ocular and otolith-ocular responses, indicating an interaction between the two. Based on this information, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
