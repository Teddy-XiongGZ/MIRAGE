    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant documents that discuss minimal access surgery in newborns. Document [0] states that minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses. Document [2] mentions that minimal access surgery in the newborn has advantages such as better cosmesis, less trauma, and better postoperative musculoskeletal function. However, it also mentions that prospective randomized trials and high-level evidence for the benefit of endoscopic surgery are still scarce. Document [4] states that minimally invasive surgery in neonates extends benefits such as decreased pain. Based on these documents, it is not clear whether minimal access major surgery in the newborn hurts less. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
