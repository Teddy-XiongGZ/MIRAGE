    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can gather the following information: - Document [0] states that the tendency to imitate other people's drinking was not related to participants' induced stress levels. - Document [2] found that participants imitated the sips of confederates, but the likelihood of imitation was lower when confederates were drinking alcoholic beverages and participants were drinking non-alcoholic beverages compared to when both were consuming alcohol. - Document [6] suggests that social ingratiation motives may be an important factor explaining social imitation of alcohol consumption. - Document [8] found that participants consumed substantially more alcohol when exposed to heavy-drinking models compared to light- and non-drinking models, indicating imitation of drinking behavior. - Document [12] also found that both men and women imitated same-sex peers' drinking behavior in a naturalistic bar setting. - Document [18] showed that stress was associated with decreased alcohol consumption, contrary to the hypothesis that stress would increase imitation of drinking behavior. - Document [21] reviewed animal studies and found that the effects of stress on alcohol consumption have generally been mixed, with some studies showing no effect or decreased alcohol consumption. Based on this information, it can be concluded that stress does not consistently increase imitation of drinking behavior. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
