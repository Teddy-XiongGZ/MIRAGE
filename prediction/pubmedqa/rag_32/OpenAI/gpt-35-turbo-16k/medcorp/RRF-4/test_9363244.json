    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no clear evidence to suggest that occupational nuclear power plant radiation affects conception and pregnancy. Document [0] states that there were no differences in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure between sterile and fertile groups, and abnormalities in spermiograms were temporary and not correlated with radiation dose. Document [1] also found no evidence of increased risk of fetal death or congenital malformation in the offspring of men and women occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Document [3] found no support for a hypothesis linking exposure to low-level ionizing radiation among men with primary infertility. Overall, the available evidence does not support the idea that occupational nuclear power plant radiation affects conception and pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
