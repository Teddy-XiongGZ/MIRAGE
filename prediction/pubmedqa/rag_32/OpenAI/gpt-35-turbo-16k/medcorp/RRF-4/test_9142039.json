    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents and look for information on the relationship between pediatric housestaff experience and tests ordered for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We can start by examining the findings and conclusions of the studies mentioned in the documents. Document [0] found that interns ordered significantly more arterial blood gases per infant than residents, but there was no difference in ordering radiographs or electrolytes. Document [2] also found that interns ordered more arterial blood gases per infant than residents, especially under conditions of heavy workload. Document [3] found that increased clinical workload resulted in a significantly greater probability of infants receiving an umbilical artery catheter, but a lower probability of receiving a lumbar puncture or peripheral phlebotomy. Based on these findings, it seems that pediatric housestaff experience may influence the tests ordered for infants in the NICU, particularly in the case of arterial blood gases. However, more research is needed to determine if this relationship holds true for a broader array of tests and outcomes. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
