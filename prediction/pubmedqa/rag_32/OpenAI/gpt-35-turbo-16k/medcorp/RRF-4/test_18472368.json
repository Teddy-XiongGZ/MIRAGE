    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that a longer treatment duration is identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Document [2] mentions that overall treatment time did not significantly influence any of the outcome endpoints. Document [7] suggests that a longer duration of androgen deprivation therapy combined with radiotherapy significantly improves progression-free survival. Document [9] states that time to treatment did not have an effect on outcomes for patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy. Based on these documents, it seems that the impact of treatment duration on outcome after radiotherapy for prostate cancer is not clear. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
