    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, bedside assessment alone cannot reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke. Document [0] states that bedside assessment by a speech and language therapist gave a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 86% for the presence of aspiration. Document [2] also mentions that bedside swallowing assessment tends to over-diagnose aspiration and mistook laryngeal penetration for aspiration. Additionally, Document [7] states that the combination of bedside clinical methods with fiberoptic endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES) improved the accuracy of detecting aspiration. Therefore, considering the limitations of bedside assessment and the need for objective methods like FEES, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
