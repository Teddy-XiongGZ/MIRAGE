    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the APACHE II score is used as an intensive care unit (ICU) admission score in emergency surgical patients. However, there are mixed findings regarding its reliability as a marker of physiological impairment. Document [0] suggests that the APACHE II score used in emergency surgical patients might lead to bias in the comparability of patient groups and in the evaluation of treatment policies. Document [2] also states that the APACHE II score needs to be validated in a larger population before implementation. On the other hand, Document [3] indicates that the APACHE II score is a good predictor of morbidity and mortality in preoperative evaluation of patients. Considering these conflicting findings, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the APACHE II score is a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
