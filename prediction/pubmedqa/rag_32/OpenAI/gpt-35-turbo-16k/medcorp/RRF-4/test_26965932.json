    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to support the use of bare-metal stents (BMS) in certain situations, particularly in high bleeding risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Document [5] specifically states that in high bleeding risk patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease, BMS implantation provides superior efficacy and safety compared to conventional drug-eluting stents (DES). Document [15] also mentions that BMS may be reasonable in patients who require noncardiac surgery within 4 to 6 weeks of PCI or in patients who are at a very high risk of bleeding while taking dual antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
