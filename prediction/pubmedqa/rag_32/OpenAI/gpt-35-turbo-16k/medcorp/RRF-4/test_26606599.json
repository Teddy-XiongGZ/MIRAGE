    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if surrogates of injury severity influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the relationship between injury severity surrogates and the development of heterotopic ossification in acetabular fractures. It states that length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospital stay >10 days were significantly associated with the development of heterotopic ossification. Document [1] also mentions that adequate prophylactic irradiation or indomethacin can prevent severe heterotopic ossification. Document [9] further supports this by stating that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for developing heterotopic ossification in patients treated for acetabular fractures. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that surrogates of injury severity do influence the occurrence of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
