    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that surgical effort, including quaternary cytoreductive surgery, can still matter in ovarian cancer. Document [1] states that quaternary cytoreduction in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer appears to be a safe procedure and may bring survival benefit in selected cases. Document [2] also supports the efficacy of tertiary and quaternary cytoreduction in recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Additionally, Document [5] mentions that in carefully selected patients, quaternary cytoreduction may be associated with acceptable morbidity and a relatively robust disease-specific survival. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
