    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant documents that discuss the effects of strategy training on age-related deficits in working memory. Document [0] discusses a study that evaluated working memory performance after training individuals to use effective encoding strategies. The study found that strategy training can boost working memory performance, but the age-related working memory deficit was not greatly affected. Document [1] also discusses the strategy-deficit hypothesis, which states that age differences in the use of effective strategies contribute to age-related deficits in working memory span performance. However, the study found that age differences in effective strategy use cannot explain the age-related variance in working memory performance. Document [2] discusses a study that examined the effects of working memory training in old-old adults. The study found that working memory training improved performance in trained tasks, but there were no transfer effects to other cognitive tasks. Based on these documents, it seems that strategy training can improve working memory performance, but it may not fully reduce age-related deficits. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
