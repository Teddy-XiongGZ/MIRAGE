    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence that body mass index (BMI) does influence morbidity and long-term survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy. Several studies have shown that BMI is associated with various factors such as postoperative complications, operative time, number of retrieved lymph nodes, and overall survival. Some studies have reported that a higher BMI is associated with increased postoperative complications and longer operative time, while others have found that a higher BMI is associated with better overall survival. However, it is important to note that the impact of BMI on prognosis may vary depending on other factors such as tumor stage and location. Overall, the evidence suggests that BMI does have an influence on morbidity and long-term survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
