    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the prevalence of retinal haemorrhages after convulsions is rare. Document [0] states that retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare and should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.
