    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that failures of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are associated with steep posterior tibial slopes. Document [1] states that the most accurate predictor of ACL failure was a lateral posterior tibial slope (LTPs) >7.4\u00b0. Document [4] also mentions that a posterior tibial slope (PTS) >12\u00b0 may be considered a risk factor for recurrent ACL injury. Additionally, Document [25] found that an increased lateral tibial posterior slope (LTPS) was associated with a higher risk of ACL graft rupture. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
