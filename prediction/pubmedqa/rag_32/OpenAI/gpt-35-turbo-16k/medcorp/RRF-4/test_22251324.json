    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is mixed evidence regarding whether performance in selection processes predicts performance as a dental student. Some studies suggest that certain selection criteria, such as pre-dental GPA and DAT scores, can be important predictors of dental school performance. Other studies, however, indicate that selection criteria, including academic average, UMAT scores, interview performance, and UKCAT scores, do not predict performance as a dental student. Additionally, factors such as ethnicity, student status, and existing school results have been found to be better predictors of dental school performance than pre-admission test scores. Overall, the evidence is inconclusive and there is no definitive answer to whether performance in selection processes predicts performance as a dental student.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
