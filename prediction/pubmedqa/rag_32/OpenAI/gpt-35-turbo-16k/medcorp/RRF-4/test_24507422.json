    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, shape analysis can differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack. Document [0] discusses a study that used quantitative shape analysis to accurately differentiate free-floating intraluminal thrombus (FFT) from atherosclerotic plaque. The study collected cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA and used shape descriptors to construct a logistic regression model that demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% in distinguishing FFT from plaque. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
