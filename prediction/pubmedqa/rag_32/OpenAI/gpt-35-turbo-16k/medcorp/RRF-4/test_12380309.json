    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that circumcision should be restricted to children over three years of age whose foreskin remains unretractable. Document [2] mentions that the reasons for circumcision are mostly based on tradition rather than a medical approach. Document [3] states that circumcision in children should only be performed for medical reasons and highlights the morbidity associated with the procedure. Document [6] reviews the literature on circumcision and concludes that the limited reduction in incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and the uncertain preventive role of circumcision towards penile cancer, STDs/HIV infection, and AIDS make it difficult to justify circumcision in newborns. Document [11] also concludes that there is little high-quality medical evidence to support the overall benefit of non-therapeutic circumcision in healthy infants or children. Considering this information, the answer is B. no, circumcision should not be performed in childhood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
