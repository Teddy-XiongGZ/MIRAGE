    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is conflicting information regarding the influence of patient position during liver surgery on the risk of venous air embolism. Document [0] suggests that the reverse-Trendelenberg position can be safely used to maintain a low central venous pressure during liver surgery, which may help decrease the risk of venous air embolism. However, Document [1] states that the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be determined definitively based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
