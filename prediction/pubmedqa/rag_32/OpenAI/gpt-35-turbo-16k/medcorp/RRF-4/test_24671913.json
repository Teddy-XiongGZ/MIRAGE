    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, several studies have investigated the association between SYNTAX score and in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). These studies consistently show that a higher SYNTAX score is associated with worse in-hospital outcomes, including higher rates of mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, SYNTAX score does predict in-hospital outcomes in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
