    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] provides information on the alterations of echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in patients who received LAA occlusion therapy. Document [0] states that after LAA occlusion, a slight and measurable movement of QRS electric axis was observed in most patients. The significant differences were also observed in heart rate (HR) and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. However, there existed no significant difference in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation. Based on this information, we can conclude that LAA occlusion device does alter the electrocardiogram parameters, but does not alter the echocardiography parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
