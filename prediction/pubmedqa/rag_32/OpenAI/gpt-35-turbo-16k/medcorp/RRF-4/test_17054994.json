    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if frozen section alters surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that in none of the 135 patients did frozen section alter the intraoperative management. Document [2] also mentions that frozen section examination rarely affected intraoperative decision making in thyroid surgery. Document [5] concludes that routine use of intraoperative frozen section may be unnecessary. Document [9] recommends against the routine use of frozen section during thyroidectomy. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that frozen section does not alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
