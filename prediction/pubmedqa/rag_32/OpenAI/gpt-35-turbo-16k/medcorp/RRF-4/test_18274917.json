    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is clear that not all cases of low-tone sudden deafness (SD) progress to Meniere's disease. Document [0] states that there was no difference in the rate of progress from SD to Meniere's disease between low-tone and high-tone SD groups. Document [1] also mentions that only 6 out of 80 patients with low-tone sudden deafness subsequently progressed to Meniere's disease. Additionally, Document [2] states that patients with sudden low-tone loss who were not classified as acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss (ALHL) had a recurrence and/or progression rate to Meniere's disease similar to ALHL patients. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
