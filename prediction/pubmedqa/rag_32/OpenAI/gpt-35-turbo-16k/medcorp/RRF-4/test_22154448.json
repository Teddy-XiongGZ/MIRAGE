    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, there is no evidence to suggest that epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis is a risky technique. Document [0] states that in a series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) did not result in any spinal hematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess. Document [2] also supports the use of epidural analgesia for cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC, stating that clot kinetics indicate that epidural catheters may be recommended for post-operative analgesia. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
