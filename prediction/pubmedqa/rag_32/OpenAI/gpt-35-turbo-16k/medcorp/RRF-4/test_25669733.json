    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, there is evidence to suggest that distal ureteral diameter can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection. Document [0] states that distal ureteral diameter (UD) and distal ureteral diameter ratio (UDR) were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis. Document [1] also supports this, stating that distal ureteral diameter ratio (UDR) was a significant predictor of reflux resolution and success of endoscopic injection. Additionally, Document [15] found that distal ureteral diameter measurement was predictive of reflux outcome. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
