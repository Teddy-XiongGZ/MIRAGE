    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the dimensions of bony and mucosal components of the middle turbinate on concave and convex sides of the septum were not significantly changed by septoplasty. Document [7] also mentions that the dimensions of the middle turbinate were not significantly different between the convex and concave sides. However, document [21] suggests that compensatory middle turbinate hypertrophy is caused by conchal bone growth and mucosal hypertrophy in patients with nasal septal deviation. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that septoplasty does not change the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
