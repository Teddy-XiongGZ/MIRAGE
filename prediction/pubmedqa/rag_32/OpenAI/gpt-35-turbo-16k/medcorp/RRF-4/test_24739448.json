    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the FDA issued a warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Document [2] mentions that multiple analyses were conducted for many AEDs, but no study provided clear or convincing support for the FDA conclusions. Document [3] found no significant difference in suicide attempt rates before and after gabapentin prescription. Document [4] mentions that the FDA warning led to increased awareness of the risk of suicidality and psychiatric co-morbidity in patients with epilepsy. Document [5] states that the FDA released an alert regarding an increased risk of suicidality in patients taking AEDs, but the relevance to patients with epilepsy is unclear.
