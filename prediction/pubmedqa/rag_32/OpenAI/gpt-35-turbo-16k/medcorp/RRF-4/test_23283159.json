    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if obesity is a risk factor for wheezing among adolescents, we can review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic individuals at 11 years. Document [1] also supports this finding, stating that obesity was associated with an increased risk of wheezing in boys. Document [2] found that the association between obesity and asthma was greater among girls with early puberty. Document [3] found that obesity was associated with incident wheeze in girls but not in boys. Document [4] suggests a bidirectional association between wheezing and obesity during adolescence. Document [5] found that excess weight increased the risk of wheezing in children. Document [6] found that girls reported more asthma and wheeze in association with overweight compared to boys. Document [7] found that overweight children had a greater frequency of wheezing. Document [8] found that obesity was associated with non-atopic asthma/wheeze. Document [9] suggests that overweight/obese girls with early menarche may be a wheezing phenotype. Document [10] found a significant association between obesity and the prevalence of wheezing in children. Document [11] found that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of wheezing in boys. Document [12] found that maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity were risk factors for wheezing in adolescents. Document [13] found that obesity was associated with an increased risk of wheezing in Mexican adolescent females and young women. Document [14] found a positive association between obesity and prevalence of asthma symptoms and asthma severity in adolescents. Document [15] found that obesity was associated with a higher prevalence of wheezing in young children. Document [16] found that early-onset asthma and wheezing were associated with an increased risk of developing obesity in later childhood. Document [17] found that higher weight for height was associated with wheezing in infants with lower respiratory illnesses. Document [18] found that obesity was a significant risk factor for wheezing in children. Document [19] found that maternal obesity was associated with an increased risk of wheezing in children. Document [20] found that overweight or obesity was associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma and wheeze. Document [21] found that maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of wheezing and asthma in childhood. Document [22] found that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma and wheeze. Document [23] found that overweight and obesity were risk factors for reduced lung function in school-aged children. Document [24] found that low birth weight, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and low maternal age were risk factors for wheezing in childhood. Document [25] found that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of wheezing in children. Document [26] found that obesity was associated with an increased risk of wheezing in girls. Document [27] found that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of asthma in early adolescence. Document [28] found that early menarche before 11 years of age was not associated with an increased risk of wheezing in girls. Document [29] found that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of incident asthma in childhood. Document [30] found that weight status had no association with asthma or allergy in adolescence after wheezing in infancy. Document [31] found that different wheezing phenotypes were associated with different risk factors. Based on the evidence from these documents, it can be concluded that obesity is indeed a risk factor for wheezing among adolescents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
