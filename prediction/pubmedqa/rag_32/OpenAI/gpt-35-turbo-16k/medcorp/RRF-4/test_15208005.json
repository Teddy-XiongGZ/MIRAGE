    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is clear that the Omega-3 Index is considered a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease. Multiple studies have shown that low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, as reflected in the Omega-3 Index, are associated with an increased risk of death from coronary heart disease, especially sudden cardiac death. The Omega-3 Index has been found to fulfill many of the criteria for a risk factor, including consistent epidemiological evidence, a plausible mechanism of action, a reproducible assay, independence from classic risk factors, modifiability, and the demonstration that raising levels will reduce risk for cardiac events. Therefore, the answer to the question is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
