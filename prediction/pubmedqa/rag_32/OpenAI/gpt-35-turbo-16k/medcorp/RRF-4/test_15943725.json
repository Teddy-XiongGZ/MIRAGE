    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, it is clear that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase. Multiple studies have shown that serum lipase offers higher sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing acute pancreatitis compared to serum amylase. The diagnostic accuracy of serum lipase is further supported by its longer elevation period, making it a useful diagnostic biomarker in both early and late stages of acute pancreatitis. Additionally, guidelines recommend the use of lipase over amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Therefore, the answer is A. yes, serum pancreatic lipase should replace serum amylase as a biomarker of acute pancreatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
