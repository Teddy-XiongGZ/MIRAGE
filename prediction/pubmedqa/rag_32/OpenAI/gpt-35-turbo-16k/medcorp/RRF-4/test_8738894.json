    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence suggesting a possible association between occupational arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers. Document [0] reports a slightly elevated risk of diabetes mellitus among glass workers, especially those exposed to arsenic. Document [1] also mentions studies carried out in Sweden that revealed an increasing trend of diabetes mellitus with increasing arsenic exposure from inhalation. Document [3] further supports this association, reporting a significant increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among individuals exposed to arsenic in drinking water in Bangladesh. However, it is important to note that some studies have limitations, such as small sample sizes or lack of adjustment for confounders. Therefore, while there is evidence suggesting a possible link, further research is needed to establish a definitive answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
