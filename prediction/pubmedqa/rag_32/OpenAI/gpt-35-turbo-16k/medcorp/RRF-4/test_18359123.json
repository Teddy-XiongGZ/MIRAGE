    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [6] titled 'The good body: when big is better.' discusses the concept of 'bigness' and how bigger bodies are often associated with power and social hierarchy. However, this document focuses on cultural perceptions of body size rather than a general statement about whether it is better to be big. Document [15] titled 'Is bigger really better?' discusses the relationship between group size and measures of performance in a professional setting. While this document provides insights into the impact of group size on performance, it does not directly address the question of whether it is better to be big. Document [19] titled 'Is bigger better? Macrosomia and psychopathology later in life.' explores the association between birth weight and later psychopathology, suggesting a curvilinear relationship. However, this document specifically focuses on macrosomia (excessive birth weight) and its potential link to mental illness, rather than providing a general answer to the question. Based on the analysis of these documents, we cannot definitively conclude whether it is better to be big or not. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
