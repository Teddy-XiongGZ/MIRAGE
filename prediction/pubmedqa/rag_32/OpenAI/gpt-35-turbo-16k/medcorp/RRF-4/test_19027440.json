    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can predict which head and neck cancer survivors develop fears of recurrence. Document [0] states that a third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Document [1] also supports this by stating that fear of recurrence affects the quality of life of head and neck cancer survivors. Additionally, Document [2] mentions that fear of recurrence is a primary concern for both cancer survivors and their caregivers. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, we can conclude that fears of recurrence are common among head and neck cancer survivors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
