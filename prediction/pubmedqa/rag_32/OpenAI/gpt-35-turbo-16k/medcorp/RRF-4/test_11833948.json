    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the answer to the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward was associated with a longer total hospital length of stay for patients aged over 75 with fracture of the proximal femur. Document [1] found no significant differences in outcomes between patients with delayed transfer for medical reasons and those without delay. Document [2] suggests that delay in transfer to a geriatric unit for rehabilitation was associated with higher hospital mortality rate and delay in regaining independent mobility. Document [4] found that delayed femur fracture repair was associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher complication rates. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that a delay in transfer to a rehabilitation unit for older people does affect the outcome after fracture of the proximal femur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
