    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the expression of c-kit protooncogene has been observed in hepatitis B virus-induced chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The expression of c-kit was found to be parallel with the grade and stage of the disease in chronic hepatitis B infection. Additionally, c-kit positivity was observed in the mitotic, proliferating, and dysplastic hepatic cells in HCC specimens. These findings suggest that c-kit expression may have a diagnostic role in hepatitis B virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
