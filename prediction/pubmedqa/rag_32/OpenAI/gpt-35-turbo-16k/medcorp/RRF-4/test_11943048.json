    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant documents that discuss the impact of hospice care on pain management in nursing homes.

The study found that hospice residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain. Document [3] also supports this finding, stating that hospice use in nursing homes is associated with increased pain management among residents with documented pain.
