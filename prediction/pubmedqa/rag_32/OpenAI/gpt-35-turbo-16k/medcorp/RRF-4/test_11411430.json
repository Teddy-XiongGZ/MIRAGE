    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is clear that antral follicle assessment is a better predictor of outcome in IVF compared to age and FSH. Document [0] states that antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of IVF outcome than age or follicle stimulated hormone. Document [1] also supports this, stating that AFC was the best and only independent parameter among other parameters to predict poor response to ovarian stimulation. Document [2] further confirms that AFC performs well in the prediction of poor ovarian response and is more accurate compared to basal FSH level. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
