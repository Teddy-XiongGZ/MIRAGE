    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that hormonal differences may be responsible for the gender dimorphism observed after injury and hemorrhagic shock. Document [0] states that female gender is independently associated with a lower risk of multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection, even in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Document [4] also supports this, stating that female sex hormones (estrogen) produce salutary effects following trauma-hemorrhage, while male sex steroids (5alpha-dihydrotestosterone) are suppressive to immune and cardiac functions. Additionally, Document [28] found that hormonally active women have a better physiologic response to shock and trauma compared to men. These findings suggest that hormonal differences may play a role in the gender-based differences observed after injury and hemorrhagic shock.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
