    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, HER2 immunoreactivity has been evaluated in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy. The studies have shown that HER2 immunoreactivity is significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. However, the prognostic value of HER2 immunoreactivity is limited and may vary depending on the treatment received. Therefore, the answer is maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
