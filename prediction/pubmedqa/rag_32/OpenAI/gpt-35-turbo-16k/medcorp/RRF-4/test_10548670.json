    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can analyze the relationship between the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and left hemisphere strokes. Document [0] states that the volume of stroke in patients with right hemisphere strokes is statistically greater than the volume of stroke in patients with left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS. This suggests that the NIHSS may favor right hemisphere strokes in terms of stroke volume. However, Document [5] mentions that the NIHSS places more value on deficits in the left hemisphere due to its focus on cortical function. This indicates that the NIHSS may favor left hemisphere strokes in terms of cortical deficits. Overall, the information is conflicting and does not provide a definitive answer. Therefore, the answer choice is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
