    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the evaluation of quality of care for surgical patients with colorectal cancer using process indicators and their consistency with short-term outcomes. Document [0] discusses the association between composite measures based on process indicators and short-term outcome indicators. It states that at the hospital level, a good score on the composite measures based on process indicators was consistent with more favorable risk-adjusted short-term outcome rates. Document [1] also supports this finding, stating that most evaluated process indicators for colorectal cancer care were associated with better hospital-specific patient outcomes. Based on this information, it can be concluded that scores based on process indicators are consistent with short-term outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
