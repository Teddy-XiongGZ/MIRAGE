    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] states that extreme grandmultiparity does not appear to be an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcome. Document [1] suggests that grandmultiparous women have increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, even after controlling for confounders. Document [2] indicates that grandmultiparity is associated with a higher risk of various complications and adverse neonatal outcomes. Document [3] states that in developed populations with improved obstetric services, parity per se is no longer considered a significant risk for adverse obstetric and perinatal outcome. Document [4] suggests that the influence of high parity on perinatal outcome may be related to socioeconomic conditions. Based on these documents, it seems that grandmultiparity may be a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, but the evidence is not conclusive. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
