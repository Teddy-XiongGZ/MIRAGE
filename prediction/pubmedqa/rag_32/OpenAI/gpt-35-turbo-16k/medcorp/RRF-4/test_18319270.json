    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant documents for information on confined placental mosaicism (CPM) and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies. Document [0] states that the incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions, and CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI. Document [4] provides a meta-analysis of cohort studies and reports that pregnancies diagnosed with CPM have an increased risk of impaired fetal growth. Document [19] also supports this, stating that CPM is associated with fetal growth restriction and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Based on this information, the answer is likely no, confined placental mosaicism does not account for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
