    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is indicated that flexible instruments can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Document [0] states that flexible instruments can create femoral tunnel lengths of greater than 20 mm at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion. Document [1] also supports this, stating that the use of a flexible reamer system resulted in longer tunnel lengths compared to a rigid reamer system. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
