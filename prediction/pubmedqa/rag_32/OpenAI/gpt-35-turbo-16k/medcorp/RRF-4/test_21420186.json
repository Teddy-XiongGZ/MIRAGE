    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, ADMA levels in young adults born preterm are associated with the development of endothelial dysfunction. Document [0] states that high levels of ADMA are associated with the future development of adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death. Document [3] also mentions that high blood levels of ADMA are associated with the future development of adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death. Additionally, Document [13] indicates that preterm birth and low birth weight are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases in later life. Therefore, based on this information, the answer is yes, ADMA levels in young adults born preterm could predict an early endothelial dysfunction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
