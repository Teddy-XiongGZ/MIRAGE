    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents that discuss the impact of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) on the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Document [0] states that there was no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Document [1] also supports this finding, stating that IBR does not lead to a delay in the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Document [2] found that patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction did not have a delay in adjuvant treatment compared to patients with no reconstruction. Document [3] also concluded that immediate breast reconstruction does not increase the time to chemotherapy compared to mastectomy alone. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that immediate breast reconstruction does not compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
