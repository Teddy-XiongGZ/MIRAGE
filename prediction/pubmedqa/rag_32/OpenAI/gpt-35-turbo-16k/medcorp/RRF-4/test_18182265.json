    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is clear that body diffusion-weighted MR imaging is helpful in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer in nonenhanced MR imaging. The studies discuss the feasibility and value of diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in detecting endometrial cancer, with high sensitivity and specificity. DW images offer additional incremental value to conventional nonenhanced MR imaging, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of endometrial cancer are significantly lower than those of normal endometrium and benign lesions. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
