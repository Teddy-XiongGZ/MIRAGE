    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can gather the following information: \\n\\n- Document [0] states that adding a second reader increased the number of positive results and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in some patients. However, it also mentions that double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.\\n- Document [1] supports the idea that multiple reading of barium enemas can reduce false-negative perception errors and increase sensitivity.\\n- Document [2] suggests that double contrast barium enema should be used in the evaluation of rectal bleeding.\\n- Document [4] mentions that the single contrast, full column barium enema is still the routine method of colonic investigation in many institutions.\\n\\nBased on this information, it seems that the necessity of double reading of barium enemas is still a matter of debate. While it may increase the number of positive results and potentially alter clinical treatment, it does not necessarily improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and may result in a higher false-positive rate. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'C. maybe'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
