    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that a solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia compared to paired kidneys. Document [0] states that in a canine model, the solitary kidney showed less clearance reduction and less tubular necrosis compared to paired kidneys after warm ischemia. Document [1] also supports this, stating that cold ischemia is advantageous in a solitary kidney model. Document [6] further confirms that cold ischemia can safely preserve renal function in a solitary kidney model. Additionally, Document [7] states that the solitary kidney is not more resistant to ischemia compared to kidneys with a normal contralateral organ. However, the majority of the provided documents support the idea that a solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
