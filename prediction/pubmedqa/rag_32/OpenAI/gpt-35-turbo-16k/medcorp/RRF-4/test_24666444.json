    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if there is evidence of a 'July effect' in patients undergoing major cancer surgery, we can review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that there is no evidence of a July effect in patients undergoing major cancer surgery. Document [1] also supports this, finding no evidence of a July effect for head and neck cancer surgery. Document [2] mentions a 2019 study from the Yale School of Medicine that found no difference in morbidity or mortality after major cancer surgery performed in July compared to the rest of the academic year. Document [3] provides evidence of higher in-hospital mortality and complications for patients admitted in July for surgery for spinal metastases, but this is specific to spinal metastases and not major cancer surgery as a whole. Based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that there is no evidence of a 'July effect' in patients undergoing major cancer surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
