    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate is influenced by the surgeon's previous experience, we can look at the relevant documents. Document [0] compares the surgical results and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) based on the urologist's experience. It found that the senior urologist with vast TURP experience was capable of resecting four times more tissue per time unit than the more inexperienced surgeons. Document [2] also examines the improvement of a surgeon's skill in performing TURP based on the number of procedures performed. It found that as the number of TURP procedures increased and the level of skill improved, the operation time was significantly reduced and the speed of resection was significantly increased. These findings suggest that the surgeon's previous experience does influence the ability to perform TURP. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
