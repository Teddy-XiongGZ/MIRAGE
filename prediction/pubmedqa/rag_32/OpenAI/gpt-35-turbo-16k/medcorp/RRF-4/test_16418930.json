    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the comparison of visual acuity measured with Landolt C and Snellen E charts in patients with strabismus amblyopia. Document [0] compares visual acuity measured with the Snellen E and the Landolt C acuity in patients with various eye disorders, including strabismus amblyopia. It concludes that there was only a slight overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even in strabismus amblyopia. Document [1] also compares visual acuity measured with the Landolt C and ETDRS charts in subjects with and without visual disorders, including strabismus amblyopia. It finds that differences between Landolt C and ETDRS acuity were small and not statistically significant. Based on this information, the answer to the question is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
