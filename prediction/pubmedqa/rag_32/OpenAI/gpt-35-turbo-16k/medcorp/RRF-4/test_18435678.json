    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Kell alloimmunization in pregnancy is associated with fetal thrombocytopenia, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that fetal thrombocytopenia was found in 10% of pregnancies with severe Kell alloimmunization. However, none of the fetuses in the Kell alloimmunized pregnancies had a clinically significant thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count < 50 x 10(9)/l. Document [14] also mentions that fetal thrombocytopenia is common in pregnancies complicated by alloimmunization, including Kell alloimmunization. Based on this information, the answer is likely yes, Kell alloimmunization in pregnancy is associated with fetal thrombocytopenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
