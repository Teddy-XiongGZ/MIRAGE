    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the relationship between muscle power and running speed with changes of direction is not consistent. Some studies found significant relationships between reactive strength and straight speed, as well as between reactive strength and change-of-direction speed. However, other studies found non-significant correlations between concentric leg power and straight sprinting speed, as well as low and non-significant correlations between muscle power and speed while changing direction. Therefore, the answer is maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
