    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [1], a side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). The study found that systolic blood pressure difference was significantly higher in the complete reversal and alternating groups than in the systolic deceleration group. Therefore, based on this information, the blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of steal in subclavian steal syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
