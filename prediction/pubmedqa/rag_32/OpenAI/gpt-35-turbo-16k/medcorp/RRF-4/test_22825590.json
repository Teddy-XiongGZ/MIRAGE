    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant documents and look for information on the relationship between behavioural risk factors and the development of hypertension in Black South Africans. We can start by reviewing the documents that discuss the risk factors for hypertension in this population. Document [0] mentions that Africans who became hypertensive smoked more than normotensive individuals. Document [2] states that increasing age, male gender, diabetes, normal weight, overweight, obesity, and family history of high blood pressure are associated with hypertension in African participants. Document [7] suggests that psychosocial factors, such as anxiety, suppressed anger, and family instability, are predictive of hypertension in urbanized Black students. Based on this information, it seems that behavioural risk factors, such as smoking and psychosocial factors, may contribute to the development of hypertension in Black South Africans. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
