    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to review the relevant documents and analyze the findings. Document [0] states that a routinely inserted endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube did not improve the clinical course in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis after clearance of choledocholithiasis. Document [1] suggests that endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) significantly reduces the incidence of hyperamylasemia and decreases the length of hospital stay in patients with choledocholithiasis. Document [2] mentions that endoscopic drainage, including ENBD, is associated with a low morbidity rate and shorter duration of hospitalization. Based on these findings, it seems that routine insertion of a nasobiliary drainage tube after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct may not be necessary. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
