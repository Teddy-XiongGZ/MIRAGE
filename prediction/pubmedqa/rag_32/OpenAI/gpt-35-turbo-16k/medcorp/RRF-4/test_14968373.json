    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, CT is not useful in determining the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus. Document [0] states that CT is not useful in determining the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus and that air-encephalography remains the most reliable way of determining the level of CSF obstruction. Document [2] also mentions that CT scanning does not show a relationship between the level of baseline CSF pressure and the degree of hydrocephalus. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
