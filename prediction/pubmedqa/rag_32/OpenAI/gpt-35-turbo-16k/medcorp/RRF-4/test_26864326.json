    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence that both nurses and simple objective scores can predict admission at triage. Document [1] compares the predictive ability of triage nurses and the Glasgow Admission Prediction Score (GAPS) and found that both had similar discrimination and accuracy in predicting admission. Document [2] also compared the predictive ability of triage nurses with the AMB, GAP, and START scores and found that the clinical judgement of triage nurses had a higher area under the curve (AUC) compared to the scores. However, document [3] found that nurses' predictions at triage were not sufficiently accurate to inform hospital in-patient bed management systems. Overall, while nurses can predict admission at triage, the accuracy may vary depending on the specific context and scoring system used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
