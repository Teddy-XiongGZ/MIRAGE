    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, there is evidence that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can affect aerobic fitness. Document [0] found that patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of greater than 20 demonstrated a decreased maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) compared to the normal population. Document [2] also found that aerobic capacity was significantly lower in patients with OSA compared to controls. Additionally, Document [5] suggests that exercise therapy can be an effective treatment for OSA and can lead to improvements in cardio-vascular fitness. Therefore, the answer is A. yes, obstructive sleep apnea does affect aerobic fitness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
