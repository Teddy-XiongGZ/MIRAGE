    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, CA72-4 is mentioned as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer. Document [0] states that a marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer and those with endometriosis. Document [1] also mentions that CA72-4 determination is the best approach to confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometrioma in women with high CA125 levels. However, it is important to note that the specificity and sensitivity of CA72-4 as a biomarker for this differential diagnosis may vary. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
