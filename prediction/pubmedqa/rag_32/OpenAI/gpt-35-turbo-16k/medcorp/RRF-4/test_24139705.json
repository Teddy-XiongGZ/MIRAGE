    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, there is evidence that telemedicine can contribute to improving glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. Document [1] specifically mentions a study (TELEDIAB-1) that showed the Diabeo system, which combines a smartphone with an insulin dose advisor and remote monitoring by teleconsultation, improved HbA1c by 0.9% compared to controls. Additionally, Document [27] mentions a randomized controlled trial and meta-analysis that found telecare (glucometer transmission with feedback) to support intensive insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes resulted in a significantly lower 6-month HbA1c compared to the control group. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
