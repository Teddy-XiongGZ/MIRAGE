    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine whether the early adopter of drugs exists. Document [0] discusses the adoption of new drugs by general practitioners and states that early adoption of one type of drug is not associated with early adoption of another type of drug. Document [1] also supports this finding, stating that early prescribers of one new drug were not early prescribers of other new drugs. Document [4] further confirms this, stating that early adopters of new drugs share both micro- and meso-level characteristics. Therefore, based on the evidence, the answer is no, the early adopter of drugs does not exist.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
