    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if decompressive surgery is effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] is a retrospective multicenter study of 12 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis who underwent surgery. The study found that the effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive myelopathy was not evident. Document [1] also reports on the outcomes of laminoplasty for spinal cord sarcoidosis and concludes that laminoplasty is not an effective intervention for the treatment of spinal cord sarcoidosis. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that decompressive surgery is not effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
