    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] provides evidence from Finnmark county in north Norway, where they compared the rates of admissions and occupied bed days in general hospitals between populations with and without access to general practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals). The study found that populations with access to GP hospitals had lower rates of admission and occupied bed days in general hospitals, particularly for diagnoses commonly encountered in GP hospitals. Document [2] also supports this finding, showing that practices with access to community hospitals had lower rates of use of general medical and geriatric beds in district general hospitals compared to practices without access. On the other hand, Document [4] suggests that the availability of community hospitals was associated with reduced use of central inpatient services in the city of Bath, but total inpatient bed use (including central and community hospital beds) was higher in the population with access to community hospital beds. Based on these findings, the answer to the question is most likely A. yes, general practitioner hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
