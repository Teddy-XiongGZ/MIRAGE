    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents, we can refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] states that there was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view (including oblique views) and two-view radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. Document [1] mentions that oblique views are essential in children and young adults for detecting spondylolysis. Document [2] suggests that two-view plain films (without oblique views) are the best initial study for diagnosing spondylolysis in pediatric patients. Document [7] recommends eliminating oblique views in routine radiography of the pediatric lumbar spine due to low diagnostic yield and increased cost and radiation exposure. Based on these documents, it seems that the value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents is uncertain. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
