    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the zeolite hemostatic agent has been shown to be beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial injury. Document [0] states that the application of zeolite led to a slower drop in blood pressure and decreased total blood loss. Document [1] also supports this, stating that the compound zeolite hemostat effectively controlled hemorrhage and dramatically reduced mortality from a lethal groin wound. Additionally, Document [5] found that the new hemostatic agent consisting of a granular combination of zeolite and a polymer was superior to other hemostatic agents tested in a lethal vascular injury model. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
