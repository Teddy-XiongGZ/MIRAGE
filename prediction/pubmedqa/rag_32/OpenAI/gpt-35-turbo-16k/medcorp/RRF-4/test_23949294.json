    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents to determine if it is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings. Document [0] states that maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings is feasible. Document [1] also supports the feasibility of viral load monitoring in resource-limited settings to prevent treatment failure. Document [2] reports on a streamlined approach to antiretroviral therapy delivery in a resource-limited setting, which minimized the risk of non-adherence and drug resistance. Document [3] discusses the role of point-of-care viral load monitoring in achieving viral suppression in resource-limited settings. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that it is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
