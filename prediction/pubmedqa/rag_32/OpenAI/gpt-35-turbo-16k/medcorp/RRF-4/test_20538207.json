    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence that temperature monitoring during kidney allograft preservation is important. Document [0] states that temperature levels during preservation of pig kidneys were monitored using a probe, and the results showed that the new storage can maintained stable temperature levels. Document [3] also emphasizes the importance of temperature in organ preservation, specifically in liver allografts. Additionally, Document [4] mentions that the optimal temperature for organs during cold ischemia time ranges from 4 degrees C to 8 degrees C. Considering these findings, it is reasonable to conclude that temperature should be monitored during kidney allograft preservation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
