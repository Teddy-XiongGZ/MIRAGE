    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is suggested that single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and double prostheses. Document [0] states that echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses. Document [2] reports a case where both previous prostheses were removed and replaced with a repeat Manouguian procedure, resulting in successful treatment. Document [9] analyzes the results of operations for aortic infective endocarditis with mitral involvement and concludes that patients generally do well after surgery. Document [16] presents a study on patients with native valve endocarditis affecting both the aortic and mitral valves, and reports that surgical treatment has late survival and freedom from reinfection similar to those of patients with single heart valve infection. However, it is important to note that the decision to perform single-valve replacement should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the specific circumstances and individual patient factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
