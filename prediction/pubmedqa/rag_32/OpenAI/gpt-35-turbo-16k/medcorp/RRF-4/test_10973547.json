    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if patients with Werlhof's disease are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] and Document [1] specifically mention Werlhof's disease and cardiac surgery. Document [0] states that patients with Werlhof's disease may undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding complications, despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively. Document [1] supports this finding by reporting that preoperative immunoglobulin treatment in patients with Werlhof's disease undergoing cardiac surgery significantly increases platelet counts and may be useful in selected patients. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that patients with Werlhof's disease are not at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
