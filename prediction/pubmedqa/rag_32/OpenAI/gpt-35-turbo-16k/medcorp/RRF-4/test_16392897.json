    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document [0] discusses the correlation of results in BCRABL transcript detection using quantitative real-time PCR. It states that despite significant differences in methodologies, if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used, the quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories. Therefore, the answer is yes, correlated results are possible from homebrew assays.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
