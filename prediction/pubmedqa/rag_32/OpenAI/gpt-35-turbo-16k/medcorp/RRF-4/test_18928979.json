    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, myometrial electrical activity can indeed identify patients in preterm labor. Document [0] states that measuring myometrial electrical activity can enhance the identification of patients in true premature labor. Document [1] also supports this, stating that myometrial electrical activity is associated with time-to-delivery in preterm labor. Document [6] further confirms this, stating that the intensity of electrical uterine activity is a significant predictor of preterm delivery.
