    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, there is evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes may play a role in transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). Document [0] discusses the association of beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1, ADRB2) polymorphisms with TTN, showing that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and loss-of-function genetic variations in ADRB2 gene may predispose to TTN. Document [3] also mentions the use of inhaled \u03b2-adrenergic agonists in the treatment of TTN. However, it is important to note that the evidence is not definitive and further research is needed to fully understand the role of these polymorphisms in TTN.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
