    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, there is consistent evidence that a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a prognostic factor for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Multiple studies have shown that lower HRQOL scores, including measures of pain, dysphagia, physical functioning, and overall QOL, are associated with poorer survival outcomes. These findings suggest that HRQOL assessments can provide independent prognostic information for survival in NSCLC patients. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
