    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation are equivalent, we can examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation are overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. It also mentions that evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for physically nonaggressive agitation. Document [1] describes physically nonaggressive behaviors as including general restlessness and pacing, while verbally agitated behaviors include constant requests for attention. Document [4] also mentions physically nonaggressive behavior as a separate factor from physical aggression and verbal agitation. Based on this information, it can be concluded that wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation are not equivalent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
