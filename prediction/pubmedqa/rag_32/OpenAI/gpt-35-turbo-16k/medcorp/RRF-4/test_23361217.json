    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] explores the effect of component design and material on postoperative alignment in unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR). It specifically compares the mechanical alignment correction obtained in two groups: one with an all-polyethylene inlay component and the other with a metal-backed onlay component. The study found that patients who received a metal-backed onlay tibial component had better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received all-polyethylene inlay prostheses. Therefore, the type of tibial component does affect mechanical alignment in UKR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
