    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using cyanoacrylate adhesive for intestinal anastomosis. Document [0] suggests that cyanoacrylate may impede healing and have a negative influence on anastomotic healing. Document [2] also indicates that the application of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate in colonic anastomosis seems to be detrimental. Document [3] mentions that outcomes of experimental studies using cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis have not been satisfactory. However, document [6] suggests that cyanoacrylate may be useful for high-risk intestinal anastomoses. Overall, the evidence is mixed and there is no clear consensus on the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
