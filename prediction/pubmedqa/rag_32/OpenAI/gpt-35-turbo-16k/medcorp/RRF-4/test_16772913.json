    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents that provide information on the deflation rates of prefilled textured saline breast implants versus standard textured saline breast implants. Document [0] compares the deflation rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants with Mentor Siltex textured saline breast implants. It states that the cumulative deflation rates of the Poly Implant Prosthesis implants were higher than the Mentor implants at year 2, year 3, and year 4. Document [2] also mentions that underfilling is a major cause of deflation. However, there is no specific information on the deflation rates of prefilled textured saline breast implants versus standard textured saline breast implants. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively determine if there is a difference in deflation rates between the two types of implants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
