    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin resistance is a condition characterized by a decrease in sensitivity and responsiveness to the metabolic actions of insulin. It is associated with several metabolic abnormalities, including hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The documents provide evidence that insulin resistance is a major contributor to the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk. Several studies have shown that insulin resistance is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, even in individuals without diabetes. Insulin resistance is also associated with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Additionally, interventions that improve insulin sensitivity, such as metformin, have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the answer to the question is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
