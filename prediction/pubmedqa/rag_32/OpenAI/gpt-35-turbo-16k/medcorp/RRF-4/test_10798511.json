    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence suggesting that computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen may not always be necessary in intoxicated patients with blunt trauma. Document [0] states that physical examination and attention to clinical risk factors allow accurate abdominal evaluation without CT in intoxicated, hemodynamically stable, blunt trauma patients with a normal abdominal examination and normal mentation. Document [1] also supports this, stating that in the intoxicated blunt trauma patient with normal mentation, the physical examination is a reliable indicator of abdominal injury. Document [9] provides criteria for low-risk patients with blunt abdominal trauma who may be discharged safely without further evaluation, including absence of intoxication, no evidence of lowered blood pressure or raised pulse rate, no abdominal pain or tenderness, and no blood in the urine. However, it is important to note that these findings may not apply to all cases, and clinical judgment should be exercised. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
