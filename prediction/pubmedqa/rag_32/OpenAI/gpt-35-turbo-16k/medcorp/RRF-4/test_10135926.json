    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence that oral endotracheal intubation efficacy is impaired in the helicopter environment. Document [0] states that oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting of a helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a ground setting. Document [1] also supports this finding, stating that in-aircraft intubation is significantly more time-consuming in a helicopter compared to a ground setting. Additionally, Document [2] shows that intubation success rates are significantly higher on fixed-wing or rotor-wing air ambulances compared to ground ambulances. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
