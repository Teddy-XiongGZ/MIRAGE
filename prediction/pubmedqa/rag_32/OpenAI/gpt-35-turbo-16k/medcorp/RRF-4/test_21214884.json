    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if 'high-risk' human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can be detected in human breast milk, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] indicates that no 'high-risk' HPV DNA was detected in human breast milk. Document [1] states that high-risk HPV sequences were identified in milk samples of 6 out of 40 normal lactating women. Document [2] shows that mucosal high-risk HPV types were detected in only one out of 70 ductal lavages, colostrum, and milk samples. Document [3] concludes that HPV infection in maternal milk is rare and vertical transmission through maternal milk was not detected. Document [4] demonstrates that the Holder pasteurization procedure completely inactivates high-risk HPV in human milk. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that 'high-risk' HPVs can be detected in human breast milk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
