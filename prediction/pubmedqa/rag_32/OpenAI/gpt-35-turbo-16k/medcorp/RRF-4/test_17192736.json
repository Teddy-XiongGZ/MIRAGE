    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether fluoroscopy is essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] states that complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 94.2% of patients undergoing ureteroscopic removal of lower ureteric stones. Document [1] also supports the feasibility and safety of fluoro-less endoscopic treatment of ureteral stones. Document [2] further confirms that ureteroscopic treatment without fluoroscopy can be safely and effectively performed in pediatric patients. Document [3] compares ultrasound-guided ureteroscopy with fluoroscopy-guided ureteroscopy for distal ureteric stones and finds no significant difference in stone-free rate, operative time, complications, or hospital stay. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that fluoroscopy is not essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
