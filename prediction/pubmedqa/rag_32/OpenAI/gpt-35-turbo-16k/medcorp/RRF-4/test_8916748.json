    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to examine the relevant documents that discuss socioeconomic differences in mortality after retirement. Document [2] states that socioeconomic differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and increase with age. Document [4] also supports this, stating that there are socioeconomic disparities in mortality in old age. Document [7] suggests that early retirement can have selective and protective impacts on life expectancy, indicating that socioeconomic differences may persist after retirement. Document [9] examines mortality trends among retired German men and finds that socioeconomic deprivation has substantial effects on mortality in post-reunification Germany. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that socioeconomic differences in mortality do persist after retirement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
