    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence suggesting that cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) may involve apoptosis. Document [0] mentions that studies on patients with MTS found increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, which are indicators of apoptosis. Document [2] also supports this, stating that pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms are concomitantly active in the hippocampus of patients with MTS. However, it is important to note that not all documents specifically address the question of whether cell death in MTS is apoptotic. Therefore, the answer is not definitive and falls under the category of 'maybe'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
