    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites results in serious acute side effects, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] states that acute side effects of antivenin occurred in 18% of patients, but these side effects consisted solely of urticaria in most cases. No deaths, amputations, or permanent disability occurred in patients receiving antivenin. Document [2] also mentions that acute hypersensitivity reactions to antivenin occurred in 5.4% of patients, but most reactions were mild and easily treated. Document [4] reports that immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 23% of patients receiving antivenin, but treatment of these reactions was uniformly effective with no mortality or chronic sequelae. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
