    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether PET/CT adds something to multidetector CT in the preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. It mentions that the sensitivity of MDCT/RM in lesion-by-lesion analysis of hepatic staging is superior to PET/CT. Document [3] compares the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) and PET/CT in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver. It concludes that PET/CT is superior to ceCT for the detection of recurrent intrahepatic tumors after hepatectomy and extrahepatic metastases. Document [4] states that PET-CT is a promising diagnostic modality for determining whether patients with recurrent disease in the liver are suitable candidates for curative resection. Document [7] mentions that PET/CT changes patient management in up to 30% of patients with potentially resectable liver metastases. Document [12] concludes that PET-CT is a necessary staging modality in patients with potentially resectable colorectal liver metastases. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that PET/CT does add something to multidetector CT in the preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
