    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document (Document [0]) discusses a new approach for planning knee revision surgery by assessing joint line positions using the contralateral knee. The study hypothesizes that joint lines may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from bony landmarks to the joint line of the contralateral knee using radiographic images. The study examined 200 knees of 100 patients and found that the distance between the fibular head and the joint line was a precise parameter for assessing the joint line. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the answer to the question is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
