    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is a beneficial procedure for adults who have undergone repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and have developed pulmonary valve incompetence. PVR improves symptoms of right heart failure, provides satisfactory long-term survival, and reduces the risk of early valve failure. The timing of PVR is still debated, but there is evidence that early PVR, before symptoms of heart failure develop, may be recommended to prevent irreversible right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, the answer to the question 'Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: are we operating too late?' is likely 'A. yes'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
