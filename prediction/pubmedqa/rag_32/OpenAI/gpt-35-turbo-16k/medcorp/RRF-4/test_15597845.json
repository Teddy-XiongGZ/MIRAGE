    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is indicated that the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) with certain chemotherapeutic agents can enhance the antiproliferative activity and offer a new treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancers, including ovarian cancer. Document [0] states that the combination of 2ME with epirubicine and carboplatin showed a significant additive effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. Document [3] also mentions a significant synergistic effect of 2ME with paclitaxel on the proliferation of human endometrial cancer cells. Additionally, Document [5] suggests that 2ME can increase the antiproliferative property of certain chemotherapeutics in human breast cancer cells. Therefore, based on these findings, the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol may be able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutics in the treatment of human ovarian cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
