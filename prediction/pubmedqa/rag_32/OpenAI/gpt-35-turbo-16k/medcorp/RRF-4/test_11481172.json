    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder patients does run true over time. Document [1] reports that manic and mixed episodes were consistent in significantly more patients than would be expected by chance over an 11-year period. Document [3] also supports this, stating that mixed states were more likely to be followed by mixed, depressive, and dysthymic morbidity during follow-up, while manic first-episodes were followed by more mania, hypomania, and perhaps more psychosis.
