    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents and see if there is evidence supporting the reproducibility and applicability of minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords in routine surgery. We can start by looking for information on the effectiveness and reproducibility of neochordal repair, as well as the stability of neochord implantation. We can also consider any studies comparing outcomes between repair techniques using artificial chords and other methods. Finally, we can look for any recommendations or guidelines regarding the use of minimally invasive approaches for mitral valve repair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
