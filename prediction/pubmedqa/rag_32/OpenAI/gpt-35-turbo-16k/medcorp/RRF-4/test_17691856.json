    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether midwives' competence is affected by working in a rural location, we can analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] compares the views of midwives in rural and urban settings regarding their competence and confidence in providing maternity services. It found that although the proportion of midwives who reported being competent was similar in both groups, there were some significant differences in specific competencies. Midwives in rural areas were more likely to report competence in breech delivery, while urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement and examination of the newborn. Document [1] also highlights the impact of rural geographies on midwives' decision-making and risk assessment, which is common to all settings. However, it does not directly address the question of whether competence is affected by working in a rural location. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that working in a rural location may have some impact on midwives' competence, but further research is needed to fully understand the extent of this impact.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
