    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if patients with diabetes are receiving the same message from dietitians and nurses, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] states that registered dietitian (RD) and registered nurse (RN) certified diabetes educators (CDEs) provide similar recommendations regarding carbohydrates and dietary supplements to individuals with diabetes. However, there are some differences in recommendations for fiber intake, use of the glycemic index, and treatment of hypoglycemia. Document [2] mentions that nurse practitioners (NPs) can serve as role models by presenting accurate, basic nutrition messages and referring patients to registered dietitians for medical nutrition therapy (MNT). Document [4] emphasizes the importance of an interprofessional team approach to diabetes management, including the involvement of nutritionists and diabetes educators.
