    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the ability of nomograms to predict more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than biochemical recurrence (BCR). Document [0] states that currently available nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict more clinically relevant endpoints such as prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Document [1] also supports this, stating that nomograms predicting aggressive recurrence after radical prostatectomy are more accurate than nomograms predicting BCR alone. Document [2] further validates the predictive accuracy of a nomogram for aggressive recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Based on this information, the answer is A. yes, nomograms designed to predict BCR do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR alone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
