    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to review the relevant documents and look for information comparing the noise levels of high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) and bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in preterm infants. We can start by searching for studies or observations that specifically address the noise levels of these two respiratory support methods. Once we have reviewed the relevant information, we can determine whether HFNC is noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
