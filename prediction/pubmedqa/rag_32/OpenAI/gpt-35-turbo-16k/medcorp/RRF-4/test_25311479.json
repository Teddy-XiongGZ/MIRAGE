    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inverse equity hypothesis suggests that new health interventions are initially accessed by the rich, but inequalities narrow with diffusion to the poor. To determine if this hypothesis applies to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries, we can examine the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the relationship between overall coverage and economic inequalities in coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries. It finds that economic inequalities in screening participation are lower in countries with higher aggregate coverage, indicating that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality. Therefore, based on the information provided in Document [0], the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
