    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if vitamin D deficiency is a feature of pediatric celiac disease, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [1] specifically investigates the vitamin D status of prepubertal children with CD. It states that there was no difference in 25(OH)D level between the CD and non-CD children. However, it also mentions that vitamin D deficiency was more common in non-obese CD patients compared to obese normal children. Document [2] discusses the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pediatric gastrointestinal diseases, including celiac disease. It suggests that vitamin D deficiency is common in children with gastrointestinal symptoms and disease processes, and that vitamin D status should be routinely assessed in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease. Document [3] reviews the frequency of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in children with celiac disease and concludes that fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are uncommon in children with new diagnosis of CD. Based on these documents, it seems that vitamin D deficiency may not be a consistent feature of pediatric celiac disease. However, further investigation is needed to confirm this. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
