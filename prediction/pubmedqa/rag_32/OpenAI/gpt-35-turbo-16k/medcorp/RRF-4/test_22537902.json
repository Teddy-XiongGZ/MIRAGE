    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relevant documents and look for evidence regarding the impact of global management at the same center on the results of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases. Document [1] discusses a retrospective study comparing synchronous liver metastases (SLM) resection at different centers (separate management, SM) versus at the same center (global management, GM). The study found that GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. Document [3] supports the idea of multidisciplinary discussion for patients with synchronous colorectal cancer and liver metastases, suggesting that it may alter the treatment approach. Document [7] also suggests that multidisciplinary case conference (MCC) review for synchronous colorectal cancer and liver metastases may impact the treatment approach. However, there is no direct evidence in the provided documents specifically addressing the impact of global management at the same center on the results of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases. Therefore, the answer to the question is uncertain, and the correct choice is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
