    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if cardiopulmonary bypass temperature affects postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the effects of temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid function. It states that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the 'euthyroid sick syndrome' during and after CPB. Document [2] also supports this, stating that alterations in serum concentration of thyroid hormones occur even in euthyroid patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that cardiopulmonary bypass temperature does not affect postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
