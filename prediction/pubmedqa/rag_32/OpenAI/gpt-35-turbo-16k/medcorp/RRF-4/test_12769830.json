    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether tumor depth should be included in the prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that tumor depth per se is unlikely to influence a tumor's metastatic capability, and the prognostic importance of depth can be explained by the association between tumor size and depth. Document [1] supports this by showing that histological invasion, which is correlated with tumor depth, is a significant independent predictor of overall survival and event-free survival. Document [2] also mentions that the presence of tumor near or at the margin of resection increases the risk of local recurrence, but the impact on overall survival is controversial. Document [3] discusses the current American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, which includes tumor size, histologic grade, and location, but also mentions that several other markers have been identified as prognostic factors. Based on this information, it seems that tumor depth may have some prognostic value, but it is not the sole determinant of prognosis. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
