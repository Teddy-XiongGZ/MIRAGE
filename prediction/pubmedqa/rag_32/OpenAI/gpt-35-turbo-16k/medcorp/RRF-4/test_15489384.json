    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether reducing spasticity translates into functional benefit, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [6] reports an exploratory meta-analysis that investigated the relationship between reduced arm spasticity and improved arm function in stroke patients treated with botulinum toxin. The analysis found a definite relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and the maximum change in arm function, suggesting that reducing spasticity is associated with a significant improvement in arm function. Therefore, based on this evidence, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
