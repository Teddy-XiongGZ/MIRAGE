    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents and look for evidence regarding the association between intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) and functional outcome in patients undergoing open total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer. Document [0] reports a case-control study that compared the urogenital and anorectal functional outcome of TME with and without IONM. The study found that TME with IONM was associated with significantly lower rates of urinary and anorectal dysfunction. Document [2] describes a multicenter clinical trial (NEUROS) that also evaluated the impact of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring (pIONM) on urogenital and anorectal functional outcomes in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME. The trial found that pIONM was associated with better sexual and anorectal function. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with better functional outcomes in patients undergoing open TME for rectal cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
