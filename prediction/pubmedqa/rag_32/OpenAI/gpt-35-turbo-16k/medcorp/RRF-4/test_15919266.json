    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether adjuvant radiation is necessary for stage III thymoma, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the addition of adjuvant radiation therapy did not alter local or distant recurrence rates in patients with stage III thymoma. Disease-specific survival at 10 years was similar between patients who received radiation therapy and those who did not. Document [4] also supports this finding, stating that adjuvant radiation therapy did not significantly reduce recurrence rates or improve overall survival in patients with surgically resected stage III thymoma. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that adjuvant radiation therapy may not be necessary for stage III thymoma. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
