    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the need for a pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma, we can analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that pelvic CT does not offer additional information in the vast majority of cases with renal cell carcinoma and should be performed selectively. Document [2] mentions that CT scanning is routinely used to determine the stage of renal cell carcinoma in the abdominal and pelvic regions. Document [3] states that CT scan is used to stage renal cell carcinoma and can detect lymphadenopathy and invasion to adjacent organs. Document [5] concludes that pelvic CT has a negligible yield in the staging of renal cell carcinoma and should not be routinely performed. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the need for a pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma is not necessary in most cases and should be performed selectively.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
