    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the proof of concept study investigated the effect of fenofibrate on sleep apnoea indices. The study found that fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced the percentage of time with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) <90% and obstructive apnoeas. However, there was no significant change in the apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI). While the study showed promising results in reducing certain sleep apnoea variables, it was limited in terms of sample size, treatment duration, and lack of correction for multiplicity of testing. Therefore, the answer to the question is maybe, as further investigation is needed to determine the role of fenofibrate in sleep apnoea syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
