    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the influence of affective disorder polarity on subsequent suicide attempts or completions and any differential effect of suicide risk factors by polarity were assessed. Document [0] states that after controlling for age of onset, there were no differences in prior suicide attempts by polarity although bipolar participants had more prior severe attempts. Document [3] suggests that a high frequency of depressive episodes or mixed features during symptomatic recurrences in bipolar disorder may be linked to a higher suicidal risk. Document [4] supports the hypothesis that the polarity of a patient's first mood episode can be a marker for bipolar disorder subtypes with differential risk for suicidality. Document [7] also suggests that the polarity of the first mood episode may be a marker for suicidal behavior, particularly the violent subtype. Document [14] mentions that major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation/attempts is associated with differences in inflammatory cytokine profile. Document [16] states that major risk factors associated with suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder include current mood state, severity of depression, anxiety, aggressiveness, hostility, hopelessness, comorbidity with other disorders, lifetime history of mixed states, and history of physical or sexual abuse. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that risk factors for suicidal behavior may differ by affective disorder polarity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
