    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether arch form is influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] investigates the association between arch form, tooth-size discrepancy, and sagittal molar relationship in orthodontic patients. However, it concludes that there is no association between arch form and sagittal molar relationship or Bolton discrepancy. Document [1] also examines tooth size discrepancies and arch parameters in different malocclusions, but it does not provide direct information on the influence of arch form. Document [2] analyzes dental arch dimensions and forms in a Saudi sample, but it does not specifically address the influence of sagittal molar relationship or Bolton discrepancy on arch form. Document [3] investigates Bolton tooth size discrepancies in individuals with different dental angle classifications, but it does not focus on the influence of arch form. Based on the available information, it is not clear whether arch form is influenced by sagittal molar relationship or Bolton tooth-size discrepancy. Therefore, the answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
