    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, it is indicated that combined modality treatment, specifically the combination of local therapy (such as radiation therapy) and chemotherapy, may benefit patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with lung metastasis alone. Document [0] states that patients treated with combined therapy had significantly longer post-metastasis survival and overall survival compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. Document [2] also supports this finding, stating that multimodality treatment, including chemotherapy combined with palliative radiotherapy and other local treatments to metastatic sites, improved the survival rate of patients with metastatic NPC. Additionally, Document [10] suggests that the addition of chemotherapy to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can improve overall survival in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is A. yes, combined modality treatment may benefit patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lung metastasis alone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
