    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, there is no consensus on whether PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy. Document [0] found no difference in prostate cancer detection rate at repeat biopsy between patients with fluctuating PSA levels and those with steadily increasing PSA levels. Document [1] also found no significant difference in the risk of having a positive repeat biopsy between patients with fluctuating PSA levels and those with a steady or steadily increasing PSA level. However, Document [3] found that the risk of prostate cancer at repeat biopsy was higher in men with a fluctuating PSA level and a PSA velocity (PSAV) \u22651.0 ng/mL/yr compared to those with a fluctuating PSA level and a PSAV <1.0 ng/mL/yr. Therefore, the answer to the question is not clear and more research is needed to determine if fluctuating PSA levels can be used to avoid biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. maybe\"}"
