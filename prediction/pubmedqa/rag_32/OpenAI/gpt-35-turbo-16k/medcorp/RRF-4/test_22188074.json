    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Document [0] found that IADL disability could help predict dementia in addition to other measured variables at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Document [1] also found that impairment in IADLs was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia at 5-year follow-up. Document [2] showed that decline in IADLs, particularly complex activities, was observed in individuals who progressed from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Document [3] found that impairment in IADLs was a stronger predictor of progression to dementia than cognitive impairment in individuals with MCI. Document [4] demonstrated that performance-based measures of IADLs can predict progression to dementia over 4 years. Overall, the evidence suggests that IADLs can be a useful predictor of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
