    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Document [2] states that there is no objective way of determining the prognosis in the individual, and decisions concerning duration of treatment remain empirical. Document [12] mentions that baseline factors such as elevated plasma viscosity and initial prednisolone dose can influence the duration of steroid therapy and the risk of relapse and late development of giant cell arteritis (GCA). Document [20] suggests that the sixth month of therapy can help identify patients at greater risk of relapses. However, there is no definitive answer in the documents that directly states whether the prognosis of PMR can be predicted at disease onset.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
