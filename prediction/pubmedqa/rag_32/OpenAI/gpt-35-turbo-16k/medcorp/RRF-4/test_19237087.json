    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that a significant number of colorectal cancers may be due to missed adenomas. Document [0] states that assuming these cancers developed from an adenoma, only 1.3% of cancers were missed in the adenoma phase. Document [1] estimates that 0.7 per 1000 persons undergoing a screening colonoscopy had a cancer missed at the baseline colonoscopy, and an additional 1.1 per 1000 subsequently developed cancer from a missed adenoma. Document [4] also suggests that missed or incompletely removed adenomas at prior colonoscopies may contribute to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
