    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the answer to the question. Document [0] discusses the use of a slit-lamp biomicroscopy-based method (SLBM) for measuring pupil diameter, but it specifically mentions that the SLBM underestimates mesopic pupil size. Document [2] also mentions the use of a slitlamp-based cobalt blue light for scotopic pupil measurements, but it does not specifically address mesopic pupil size. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not clear whether the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method can accurately measure mesopic pupil size. The answer is C. maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
