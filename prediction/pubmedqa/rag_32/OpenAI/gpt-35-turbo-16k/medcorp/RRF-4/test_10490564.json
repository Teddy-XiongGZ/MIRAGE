    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that profound hypotensive events can cause myocardial ischemic events in patients with coronary disease. Document [0] discusses a study that found a temporally causal relation between hypotension and symptomatic and silent ischemia in patients with coronary disease. Document [1] mentions that nifedipine, a drug used to treat hypertension, can increase the risk of coronary events in patients with unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction. Document [3] states that applying permissive hypotension to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, such as angina pectoris, may result in decreased coronary perfusion and myocardial infarction. Document [4] reports that more profound hypotension during dobutamine stress echocardiography is associated with a higher cardiac event rate. Document [5] suggests that perioperative hypotension is associated with cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing noncardiac surgery. Considering this evidence, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
