    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a less invasive surgical technique compared to open retropubic radical prostatectomy. Document [2] also mentions that robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is a less invasive surgical approach. Document [3] states that laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, including the robotic-assisted approach, is consistently associated with decreased blood loss and limited postoperative pain and hospital stay. Document [4] mentions that robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a forerunner in treatment options, yielding comparable perioperative and functional outcomes. Document [5] supports the current trend in shifting the standard of care for radical prostatectomy from open to robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach. Based on this information, the answer is A. yes, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
