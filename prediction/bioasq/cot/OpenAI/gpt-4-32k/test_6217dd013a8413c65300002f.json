    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the interaction between proteins. Proteins interact with each other to perform various functions in the body. Talin and Amot are two such proteins. Talin is a cytoskeletal protein that is involved in integrin activation, while Amot (Angiomotin) is a protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton. There are studies that suggest that these two proteins interact with each other.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
