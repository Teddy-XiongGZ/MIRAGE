    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PRP-40 is a protein that is involved in the regulation of microexons. Microexons are small segments of RNA that are included or excluded from the final mRNA molecule during splicing. The regulation of microexons by PRP-40 has been observed in several species, suggesting that it is a conserved phenomenon. However, more research is needed to confirm this in all species.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
