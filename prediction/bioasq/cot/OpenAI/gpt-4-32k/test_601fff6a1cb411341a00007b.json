    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sex differences in oncogenic mutational processes have been observed in several studies. These differences can be attributed to a variety of factors, including hormonal influences, differences in gene expression, and lifestyle factors. For example, some types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer, are more common in one sex than the other due to hormonal influences.
