    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) are short segments within Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) that undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to their partners. There are several computational tools and algorithms available that can predict the presence of MoRFs in IDPs. These tools use various features such as sequence characteristics, physicochemical properties, and structural information to make their predictions. Therefore, it is possible to computationally predict MoRFs regions in IDPs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
