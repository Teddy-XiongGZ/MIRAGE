    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycosylation is a process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This process is crucial for cellular functions such as cell-cell adhesion and immune response. Aberrant glycosylation, which means the glycosylation process is not functioning correctly, has been associated with many diseases, including cancer. Specifically, esophageal adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that occurs in the esophagus, has been linked to aberrant glycosylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
