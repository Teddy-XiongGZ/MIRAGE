    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In eukaryotes, the first amino acid of any newly synthesized protein is always methionine because the start codon (AUG) codes for methionine. However, this methionine is often removed during post-translational modification. In prokaryotes, the first amino acid is formylmethionine, which is also often removed. Therefore, not all proteins in their final form start with methionine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
