    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) are a type of stem cell that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. They have been studied for their potential use in regenerative medicine, including the treatment of stroke. Some preclinical studies have shown promising results, with MAPCs improving functional recovery after stroke. However, it's important to note that more research, including clinical trials in humans, is needed to confirm these findings and fully understand the potential benefits and risks. Therefore, it's not accurate to definitively say that they are effective for treatment of stroke at this time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
