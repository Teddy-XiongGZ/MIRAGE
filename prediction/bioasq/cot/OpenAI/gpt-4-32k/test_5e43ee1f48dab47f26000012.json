    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Circular exons are part of circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are a type of noncoding RNA. They do not directly increase gene expression because they do not code for proteins. However, they can regulate gene expression by acting as microRNA sponges or interacting with RNA-binding proteins. Therefore, the presence of circular exons does not directly increase gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
