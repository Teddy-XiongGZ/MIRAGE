    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Super-enhancers are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes that define cell identity. Mediator is a multi-protein complex that functions as a transcriptional coactivator. It interacts with transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Research has shown that Mediator is indeed present at super enhancers, where it plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
