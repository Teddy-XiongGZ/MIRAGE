    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the comparison between machine learning-based methods and statistical methods for survival analysis. Survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen. Machine learning and statistical methods both have their strengths and weaknesses. The performance of these methods can vary depending on the specific context, the quality and quantity of the data, and the way the methods are implemented. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that one method universally outperforms the other.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
