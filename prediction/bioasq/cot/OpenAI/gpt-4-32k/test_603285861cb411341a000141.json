    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a type of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are proteins that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes are recognized, TLRs can activate immune cell responses. Therefore, it's not that TLRs are induced by microbes, but rather they are activated by them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
