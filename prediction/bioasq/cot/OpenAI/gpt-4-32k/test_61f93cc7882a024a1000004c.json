    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nerinetide is a drug that has been studied for its potential use in the treatment of ischaemic stroke. In a study published in The Lancet, it was found that nerinetide did not significantly improve the clinical outcomes of patients with acute ischaemic stroke who were not treated with alteplase. However, among patients who did not receive alteplase, the use of nerinetide resulted in a significantly better outcome than placebo. Therefore, the effectiveness of nerinetide for ischaemic stroke may depend on whether or not the patient is also receiving alteplase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
