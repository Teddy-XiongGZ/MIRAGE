    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis is involved in DNA replication. Mcm2 is a component of the MCM complex which is involved in the initiation of DNA replication. Ctf4 is a protein that interacts with the MCM complex and Pol\u03b1, a DNA polymerase. This axis is involved in the synthesis of the leading strand during DNA replication. However, the transfer of histones to the leading strand DNA at the replication forks is a process that is generally carried out by histone chaperones, not the Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
