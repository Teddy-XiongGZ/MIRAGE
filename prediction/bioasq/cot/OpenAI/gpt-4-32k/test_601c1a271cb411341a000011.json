    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant's skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone, changing the growth pattern of the skull. SMAD6 is a gene that encodes a protein which inhibits bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is involved in the development of various tissues, including bone. Variants in SMAD6 have been associated with craniosynostosis, as they can disrupt the normal regulation of bone development and lead to premature fusion of the skull bones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
