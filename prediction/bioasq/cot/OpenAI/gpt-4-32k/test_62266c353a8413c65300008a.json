    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autophagy is a cellular process that can be involved in cancer development and progression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA molecule that do not code for proteins but can regulate gene expression. Recent research has shown that certain lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of autophagy and that these can be associated with the prognosis of various types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. Therefore, it is possible that autophagy related lncRNAs could be used for colorectal cancer prognosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
