    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"g-H2AX is a variant of the H2A histone family and is a component of the histone octamer in nucleosomes. When DNA double-strand breaks occur, the histone H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated on a serine four residues from the carboxyl terminus, resulting in \u03b3-H2AX. Therefore, \u03b3-H2AX is a marker for DNA double-strand breaks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
