    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ultraconserved enhancers are sequences in the genome that are highly conserved across species, indicating their importance in biological processes. They are known to regulate gene expression, often of genes involved in development. Therefore, if these enhancers are disrupted, it could potentially lead to abnormal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
