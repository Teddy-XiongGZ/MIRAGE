    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Synonymous sites are those that, even when mutated, do not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein. This is due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, where multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. While it was once thought that these sites were not functionally constrained, recent research has shown that synonymous mutations can affect gene expression, protein folding, and protein function. Therefore, synonymous sites can be functionally constrained, not only in primates and rodents, but in all organisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
