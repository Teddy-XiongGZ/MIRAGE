    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Functional tests, such as the 6-minute walk test, are often used to assess the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatments. These tests can provide valuable information about a patient's physical abilities and how they change over time. However, they are not biomarkers. Biomarkers are measurable substances in an organism whose presence is indicative of some phenomenon such as disease, infection, or environmental exposure. Therefore, while functional tests are useful in managing DMD, they are not biomarkers for the disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
