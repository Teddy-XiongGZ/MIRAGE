    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"TNF-\u03b1, or Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha, is a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation and is one of the cytokines that make up the acute phase reaction. It is produced chiefly by activated macrophages, although it can be produced by other cell types as well. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are key players in the development of pancreatic fibrosis, a characteristic feature of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Research has shown that TNF-\u03b1 can activate pancreatic stellate cells, leading to the production of extracellular matrix proteins that contribute to fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
