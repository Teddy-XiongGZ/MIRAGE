    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Allele phasing refers to the process of determining the specific combination of alleles on each chromosome. Ultraconserved elements are sequences in the genome that are highly conserved across different species. The phylogenetic utility of these elements refers to their usefulness in determining evolutionary relationships between species. Allele phasing can improve the phylogenetic utility of ultraconserved elements by providing more detailed information about the specific combinations of alleles in these sequences, which can help to more accurately determine evolutionary relationships.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
