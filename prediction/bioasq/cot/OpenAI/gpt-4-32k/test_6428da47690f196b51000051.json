    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence itself. These changes can be influenced by various factors such as age, environment, lifestyle, and disease state. Introns are non-coding sections of an RNA transcript, or the DNA encoding it, that are spliced out before the RNA molecule is translated into a protein. Although introns themselves do not code for proteins, they can play a role in gene expression. For example, some introns contain enhancers, sequences that increase the rate of gene expression. Therefore, the epigenetic status of introns can indeed affect gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
