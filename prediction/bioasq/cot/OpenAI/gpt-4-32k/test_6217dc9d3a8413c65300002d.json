    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein that provides structural support to neurons. When neurons are damaged or die, NfL is released into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood, making it a potential biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, NfL can indeed be considered a biomarker of neurodegeneration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
