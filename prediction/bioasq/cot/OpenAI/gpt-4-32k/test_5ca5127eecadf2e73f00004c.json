    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Articular cartilage is a connective tissue that provides a smooth, lubricated surface for articulation and facilitates the transmission of loads with a low frictional coefficient. It is composed of a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) that includes collagen and proteoglycans. In diseases such as osteoarthritis, the structure of the collagen matrix can change. This is due to the breakdown and loss of articular cartilage in the joints. Therefore, the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage does change with disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
