    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Erythropoiesis is the process of producing red blood cells. The TFR1 gene encodes a protein that is a receptor for transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the body. Iron is a critical component of hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Therefore, the TFR1 gene is not dispensable for erythropoiesis because without it, iron cannot be properly transported and utilized for red blood cell production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
