    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gangliosides are a type of lipid found in the outer layer of cell membranes, and they are particularly abundant in the nervous system. They play a role in cell signaling and have been implicated in various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's. However, as of February 2019, there is no definitive evidence that targeting major brain gangliosides is an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease. While some research suggests that gangliosides may play a role in the disease's progression, more research is needed to determine whether they could be a viable target for treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
