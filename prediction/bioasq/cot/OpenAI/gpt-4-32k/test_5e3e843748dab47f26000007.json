    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stretch enhancers and super-enhancers are both types of enhancers, which are regions of DNA that can bind transcription factors to increase the likelihood of transcription of a particular gene. Super-enhancers are a large cluster of enhancers that drive high levels of transcription of genes, particularly those associated with cell identity and disease. On the other hand, stretch enhancers are long enhancers that are associated with cell-specific gene expression. Given these definitions, super-enhancers are associated with higher levels of transcription than stretch enhancers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
