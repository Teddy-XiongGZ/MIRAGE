    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder characterized by weakness and wasting (atrophy) in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). It is caused by a loss of specialized nerve cells, called motor neurons that control muscle movement. The severity of SMA and the specific muscles involved vary depending on the type of the disease. There are four primary types of SMA, named for the age that symptoms begin: SMA type 1, SMA type 2, SMA type 3, and SMA type 4. However, there are also other forms of SMA that are less common, such as SMA plus, which is associated with additional symptoms, and SMA-PME, which also involves a disorder of the nervous system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
