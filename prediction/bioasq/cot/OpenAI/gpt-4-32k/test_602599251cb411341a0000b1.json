    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"bDMARDs, or biologic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs, are a class of drugs used to treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. They work by targeting specific parts of the immune system to reduce inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. The impact of these drugs on neonatal development during pregnancy is not fully understood, and the data is somewhat conflicting. Some studies suggest there may be a small increased risk of preterm birth or low birth weight, but others have found no significant impact. Therefore, the use of bDMARDs during pregnancy may potentially impact neonatal development, but more research is needed to fully understand the extent and nature of this impact.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
