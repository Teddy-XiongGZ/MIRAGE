People with this condition are genetically male, with one X and one Y chromosome in each cell, and they have male gonads (testes). Their bodies, however, do not produce enough of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

However, it does not lead to hermaphroditism, which is characterized by having both male and female reproductive organs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
