    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancers are sequences of DNA that can increase the likelihood of transcription for particular genes. They can be located upstream or downstream of the gene they regulate, and they can be located quite a distance away from the gene. They are not directional in their targeting of gene promoters, meaning they can influence gene expression regardless of their orientation relative to the gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
