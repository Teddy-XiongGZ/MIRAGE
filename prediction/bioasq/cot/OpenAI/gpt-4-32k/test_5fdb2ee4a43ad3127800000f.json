    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Somatic mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that occur in somatic cells, which are all the cells of the body except for the germ cells. These mutations can occur anywhere in the genome, and are not specifically positioned towards the nuclear periphery. The location of these mutations is not determined by their proximity to the nuclear periphery, but rather by the mechanisms of DNA replication and repair, and the specific environmental factors that cause the mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
