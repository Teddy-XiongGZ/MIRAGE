    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MRPL53 is a protein that is part of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. Some studies have suggested that changes in mitochondrial function can contribute to cancer development and progression. Therefore, if MRPL53 is involved in mitochondrial function, it could potentially have a role in cancer. However, without specific studies or evidence linking MRPL53 to cancer, it's not possible to definitively say whether it has a role in cancer or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
