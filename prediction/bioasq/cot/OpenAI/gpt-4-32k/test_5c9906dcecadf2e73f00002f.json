    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardenolides are a class of organic compounds that are part of the cardiac glycosides. They are known to have a specific effect on the heart's muscle cells, increasing their force of contraction. They achieve this by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which leads to an increase in intracellular sodium concentration. This, in turn, leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, which strengthens the heart's contractions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
