    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ubiquitination is a process that occurs in cells to mark proteins for degradation. It is a part of the cell's quality control mechanism to ensure that damaged or unneeded proteins are removed. Phagosomes are vesicles that form around a particle as a part of the cellular 'eating' process known as phagocytosis. During this process, the phagosome fuses with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome, where the particle is degraded. This process involves various proteins, including those on the phagosome. These proteins can be ubiquitinated to signal for their degradation once they have fulfilled their function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
