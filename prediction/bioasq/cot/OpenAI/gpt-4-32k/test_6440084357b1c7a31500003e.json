    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Omaveloxolone is a synthetic oleanane triterpenoid. It is known to activate Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage triggered by injury and inflammation.

There is no scientific evidence that suggests omaveloxolone activates NFkB.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
