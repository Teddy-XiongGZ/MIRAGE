    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what de novo truncating mutations are. De novo mutations are alterations in genes that are present for the first time in one family member as a result of a mutation in a germ cell (egg or sperm) of one of the parents, or in the fertilized egg itself. Truncating mutations are a type of mutation that results in a shortened protein, due to the premature stop codon in the DNA sequence. Now, WASF1 is a gene that encodes a protein that is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations in this gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, but not specifically with cancer. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that de novo truncating mutations in WASF1 cause cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
