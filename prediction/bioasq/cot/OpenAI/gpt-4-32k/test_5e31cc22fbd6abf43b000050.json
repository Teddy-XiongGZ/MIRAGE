    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemochromatosis is a condition that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is stored in the body's tissues and organs, particularly the skin, heart, liver, pancreas, and joints. There are several types of hemochromatosis, which are distinguished by their age of onset, severity, and mode of inheritance. Hemochromatosis type 4, also known as ferroportin disease, is caused by mutations in the SLC40A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called ferroportin, which is involved in the transport of iron. Hemochromatosis type 4 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Therefore, it is not caused by a mutation in a recessive gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
