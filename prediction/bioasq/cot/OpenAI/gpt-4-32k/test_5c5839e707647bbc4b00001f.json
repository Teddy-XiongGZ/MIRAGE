    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"BCL11B is a gene that encodes a protein which plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system. Haploinsufficiency refers to a situation where a person has only one functional copy of a gene, instead of the usual two, which can lead to insufficient protein production. If BCL11B is haploinsufficient, it could potentially lead to neurodevelopmental delay as the nervous system may not develop properly due to the lack of sufficient protein. Therefore, there is a link between BCL11B haploinsufficiency and syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
