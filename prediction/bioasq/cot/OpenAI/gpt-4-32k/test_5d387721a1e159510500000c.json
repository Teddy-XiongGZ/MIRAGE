    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TLR7 gene. It is involved in the innate immune response to microbial agents. TLR7 is expressed in B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells where it mediates the production of interferon in response to viral infection. It has been found that TLR7 escapes X chromosome inactivation, and as a result, females have a higher expression of TLR7. This leads to a higher induction of interferon in females, not males.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
