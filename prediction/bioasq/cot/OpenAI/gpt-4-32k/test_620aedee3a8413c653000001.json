    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"AGO2, also known as Argonaute 2, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the EIF2C2 gene. It is a part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which plays a key role in the RNA interference pathway that silences gene expression by degrading specific mRNAs. Cytokinesis, on the other hand, is the physical process of cell division, which divides the cytoplasm of a parental cell into two daughter cells. While AGO2 is involved in gene expression and RNA interference, it does not directly participate in the physical process of cell division or cytokinesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
