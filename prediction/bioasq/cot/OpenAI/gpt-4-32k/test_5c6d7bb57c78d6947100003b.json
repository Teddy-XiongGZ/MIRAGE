    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ultraconserved regions are segments of DNA sequences that are evolutionarily conserved and are identical across multiple species. They are typically found in organisms that are closely related evolutionarily. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a single-celled organism and is quite distant from multicellular organisms in terms of evolution. Therefore, it is unlikely to have ultraconserved regions that are identical to those in multicellular organisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
