    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neurofilament light (NfL) is a protein that provides structural support to neurons. When neurons are damaged or die, NfL is released into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Therefore, high levels of NfL can indicate neuronal damage. As such, NfL has been studied as a potential biomarker for various neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
