    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are three-dimensional cell culture systems derived from patient tissues. They are used to model diseases and test drug responses in a controlled environment. Since they are derived from the patient's own cells, they can closely mimic the biological behavior of the disease in the patient. Therefore, they can indeed recapitulate patient responses in the clinic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
