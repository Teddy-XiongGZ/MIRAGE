    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PRDM9 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PRDM9 gene. It is known to play a crucial role in meiosis, the process of cell division that produces reproductive cells. PRDM9 is responsible for determining the locations of recombination hotspots, which are regions in the genome where genetic recombination occurs during meiosis. Without PRDM9, these hotspots may not be properly identified, leading to errors in the recombination process and potentially resulting in infertility or genetic disorders. Therefore, PRDM9 is essential for meiosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
