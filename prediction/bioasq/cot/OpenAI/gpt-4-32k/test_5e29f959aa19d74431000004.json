    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"LB-100 is a small molecule inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), an enzyme that is often overexpressed in cancer cells. By inhibiting PP2A, LB-100 can disrupt the growth and survival of cancer cells. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that is often used to treat ovarian cancer. It works by damaging the DNA in cancer cells, which prevents them from dividing and growing. Studies have shown that LB-100 can enhance the effectiveness of cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the DNA-damaging effects of the drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
