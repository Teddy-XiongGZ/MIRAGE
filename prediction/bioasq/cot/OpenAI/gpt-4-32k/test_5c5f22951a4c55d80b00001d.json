    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, also known as GPx4, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the GPX4 gene. This enzyme belongs to the family of glutathione peroxidases, which are enzymes that catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, or lipid peroxides by reduced glutathione. Selenoproteins are a group of proteins that contain selenium in the form of the amino acid selenocysteine. GPx4 is indeed a selenoprotein, as it contains selenocysteine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
