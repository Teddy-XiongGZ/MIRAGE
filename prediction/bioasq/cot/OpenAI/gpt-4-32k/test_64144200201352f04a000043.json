    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. It can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to something you're allergic to, such as peanuts or bee stings. Anaphylaxis causes your immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock. One of the key cells involved in an allergic reaction are mast cells. When mast cells encounter an allergen, they release a variety of chemicals, including histamine, which trigger the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Therefore, anaphylaxis is indeed a result of mast cell activation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
