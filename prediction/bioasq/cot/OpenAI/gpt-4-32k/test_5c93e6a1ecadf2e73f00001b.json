    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MOV10 is a protein that is known to inhibit L1 retrotransposition. RNASEH2 is an enzyme that degrades the RNA of RNA-DNA hybrids, which is a crucial step in the process of retrotransposition. However, the interaction of MOV10 and RNASEH2 does not promote L1 retrotransposition, but rather inhibits it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
