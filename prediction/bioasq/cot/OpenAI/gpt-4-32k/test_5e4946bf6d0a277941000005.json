    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) and topologically associating domains (TADs) are both important in the organization and regulation of the genome. However, they are not the same. GRBs are genomic regions that contain a gene and its regulatory elements, which can be spread over large distances. On the other hand, TADs are self-interacting genomic regions, meaning that DNA sequences within a TAD physically interact with each other more frequently than with sequences outside the TAD. Therefore, they are different.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
