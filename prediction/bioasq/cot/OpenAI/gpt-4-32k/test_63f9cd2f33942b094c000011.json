    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microexon alternative splicing is a process that can significantly alter the function of the resulting protein. Small GTPase regulators are involved in many cellular processes, including those in the central nervous system. If the splicing of these regulators is altered, it could potentially lead to dysfunction and disease. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators could have implications in central nervous system diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
