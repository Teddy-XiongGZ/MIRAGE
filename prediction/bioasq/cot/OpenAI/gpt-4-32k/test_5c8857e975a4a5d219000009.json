    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ApoE mimetics are synthetic peptides that mimic the structure and function of the apolipoprotein E (apoE), a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and neuronal repair. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, and apoE is known to influence the clearance and deposition of this protein. Therefore, apoE mimetics are being considered as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
