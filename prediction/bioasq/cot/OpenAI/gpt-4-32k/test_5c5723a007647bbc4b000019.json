    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yeast prions are proteins that can exist in multiple conformations, some of which are self-propagating. These self-propagating conformations are similar to the misfolded proteins found in human amyloid diseases. Therefore, yeast prions have been used as models to study the basic mechanisms underlying these diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
