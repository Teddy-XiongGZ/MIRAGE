    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Viltolarsen is an antisense oligonucleotide that induces exon skipping to provide a therapeutic benefit in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients with certain genetic mutations. It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. Therefore, viltolarsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in these specific cases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
