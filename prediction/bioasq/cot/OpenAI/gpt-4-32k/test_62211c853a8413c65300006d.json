    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking whether CircRNA is produced by back splicing of exon, intron or both. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of noncoding RNA that, unlike linear RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop. They are produced by a process called back-splicing, a special type of alternative splicing. This process can involve exons, introns or both, leading to the formation of exonic circRNA, intronic circRNA, or exon-intron circRNA. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
