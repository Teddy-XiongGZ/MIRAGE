    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancers are elements of DNA that can greatly increase the likelihood of transcription for particular genes. They do not have to be close to the genes they regulate and can be located upstream or downstream of the gene, in introns, or even in other genes. They can be located thousands of base pairs away from the gene they regulate, and they can regulate multiple genes at once. Therefore, they do not have to be close to their gene targets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
