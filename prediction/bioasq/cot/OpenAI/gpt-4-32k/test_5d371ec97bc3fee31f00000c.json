    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CTCF, also known as CCCTC-binding factor, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CTCF gene. It is a DNA-binding protein that plays an important role in the architecture of the 3D genome. CTCF binds to specific DNA sequences, creating a boundary that blocks the communication between enhancers and promoters. Nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) are areas of DNA that are not wrapped around histones. These regions are accessible for proteins like CTCF to bind. Therefore, CTCF can bind at nucleosome free regions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
