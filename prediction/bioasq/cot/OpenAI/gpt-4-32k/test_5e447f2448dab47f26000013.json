    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"lncRNAs, or long non-coding RNAs, are a type of RNA molecule that do not code for proteins but have been found to play important roles in regulating gene expression. In the context of neuroscience, there is research evidence suggesting that certain lncRNAs are involved in neuronal development, including the process of neuronal outgrowth. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are indeed lncRNAs that control the extent of neuronal outgrowth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
