    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Whole-genome duplications and small-scale duplications are two different types of genetic events. Whole-genome duplications involve the duplication of the entire genome, leading to a doubling of the genetic material. Small-scale duplications, on the other hand, involve the duplication of smaller segments of the genome. The divergence between these two types of duplications would depend on the specific context and the time since the duplication event. However, in general, whole-genome duplications would be expected to lead to greater divergence, as they involve a larger amount of genetic material and thus have a greater potential for evolutionary change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
