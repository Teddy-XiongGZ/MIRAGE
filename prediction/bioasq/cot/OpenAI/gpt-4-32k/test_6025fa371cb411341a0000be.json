    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor that is highly aggressive and difficult to treat. Hypofractionated radiotherapy is a type of radiation treatment that delivers higher doses of radiation in fewer treatments.

Therefore, based on the current evidence, it cannot be said that hypofractionated radiotherapy offers any benefit for DIPG.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
