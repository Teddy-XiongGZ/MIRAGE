    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardiospheres are self-assembling clusters of cells that are derived from the heart tissue. They are composed of cardiac progenitor cells, which are cells that have the potential to differentiate into various types of heart cells. Skin fibroblasts, on the other hand, are a type of cell found in the dermis layer of the skin and are responsible for producing the extracellular matrix and collagen. While skin fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiated into various cell types, they cannot directly form cardiospheres.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
