    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exosomes are small vesicles that are secreted by cells and are involved in cell-to-cell communication. They are typically 30-150 nm in size. FACS, or Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, is a specialized type of flow cytometry. It provides a method for sorting a heterogeneous mixture of biological cells into two or more containers, one cell at a time, based upon the specific light scattering and fluorescent characteristics of each cell. However, the size of exosomes is below the detection limit of conventional flow cytometers, which is around 300-500 nm. Therefore, it is not possible to analyze exosomes with FACS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
