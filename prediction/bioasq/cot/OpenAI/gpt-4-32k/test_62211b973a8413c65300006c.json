    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"G-quadruplexes (G4) are secondary structures formed in nucleic acids that are rich in guanine. They are found in many key regulatory regions of the genome, including telomeres and oncogene promoters. Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer that is often resistant to conventional therapies. Recent research has shown that G-quadruplexes are present in glioblastoma cells and that targeting these structures can inhibit tumor growth. Therefore, G-quadruplexes could potentially be used as drug targets for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
