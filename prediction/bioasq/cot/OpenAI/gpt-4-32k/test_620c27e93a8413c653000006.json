    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I would need to have specific data or studies that show a correlation between METTL1 overexpression and patient survival. METTL1 is a methyltransferase enzyme that is involved in the methylation of tRNA. Its overexpression has been associated with various types of cancers. However, whether its overexpression is associated with better patient survival is not universally agreed upon and can depend on the type of cancer. Therefore, without specific data or studies, I cannot definitively answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Data not provided\"}"
