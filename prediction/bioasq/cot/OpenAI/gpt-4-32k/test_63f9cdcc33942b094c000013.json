    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what SRRM4 is and its role in cancer. SRRM4 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in alternative splicing, a process that allows for the production of multiple protein variants from a single gene. Some studies suggest that SRRM4 is overexpressed in certain types of cancer and may contribute to tumor growth. However, the effect of silencing SRRM4 would likely depend on the specific type of cancer, as the role of SRRM4 and its importance can vary across different cancers. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that silencing SRRM4 would inhibit tumor growth across all cancers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
