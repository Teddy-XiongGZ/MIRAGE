    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also spread by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), it is not yet clear whether the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. There have been a few reports of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in breast milk, but detection of viral RNA does not indicate the presence of infectious virus. Therefore, the risk of transmission through breast milk is currently considered to be low.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
