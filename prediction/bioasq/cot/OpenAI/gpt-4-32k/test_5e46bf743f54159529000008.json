    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are single, membrane-spanning, non-catalytic receptors usually expressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. TLR2, in particular, recognizes bacterial lipoproteins. Certain food components, such as probiotics, have been found to interact with TLRs, including TLR2. Therefore, it can be said that TLR2 activators have been found in food.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
