    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-chromosome inactivation is a process that occurs in female mammals in which one of the two copies of the X chromosome present in each cell is inactivated. The mechanism is crucial to prevent females, who have two X chromosomes, from having twice as many X chromosome gene products as males, who have only one X chromosome. Some genes, however, escape this inactivation. These genes are known as 'escapees'. Research has shown that abnormalities in X-chromosome inactivation can lead to mental impairment. Therefore, genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation could potentially be related to mental impairment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
