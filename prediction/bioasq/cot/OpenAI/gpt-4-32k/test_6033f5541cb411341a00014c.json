    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gluconeogenesis is the process of glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate precursors. The rate-limiting enzymes of this process are Pyruvate carboxylase, Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and Glucose-6-phosphatase. PCK1 is a form of PEPCK, so it is one of the rate-limiting enzymes, but not the only one.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
