    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cathepsin L is a type of protease enzyme that is known to be active in lysosomes, which are a type of organelle in the cells of animals. Endosomes are another type of organelle that are involved in the transport of proteins within the cell. While cathepsin L is not typically associated with endosomes, it is possible that it could be active in endosomes under certain conditions. However, the primary location of cathepsin L activity is in the lysosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
