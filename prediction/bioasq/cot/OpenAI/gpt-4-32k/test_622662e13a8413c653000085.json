    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"METTL3 is an enzyme that is known to methylate RNA. It is a component of the methyltransferase complex, which plays a critical role in the methylation of adenosine residues in RNA. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA molecule. Therefore, since METTL3 can methylate RNA, it should be able to methylate long noncoding RNAs as well.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
