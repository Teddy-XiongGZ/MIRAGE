    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Copy Number Variants (CNVs) are a type of structural variation where sections of the genome are repeated and the number of repeats in the genome varies between individuals. Regions of low mappability are areas in the genome that are difficult to sequence due to their complexity, such as repetitive sequences. CNVs are less likely to be detected in these regions because the sequencing technology may not be able to accurately map these regions. Therefore, it can be said that CNVs are depleted in regions of low mappability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
