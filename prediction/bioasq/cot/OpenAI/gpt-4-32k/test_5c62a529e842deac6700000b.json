    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Topologically associated domains (TADs) are a key feature of the organization of genomes in many organisms. They are regions of the genome that interact more frequently with each other than with other parts of the genome. However, studies have shown that the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome does not have these TADs. This is likely due to the fact that yeast has a simpler genome organization compared to more complex organisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
