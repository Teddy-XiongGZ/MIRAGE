    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"TET proteins are known to play a role in DNA demethylation, which is a crucial process in cell differentiation and fate determination. Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) are a type of immune cell that also undergoes differentiation. Therefore, it is plausible that TET proteins could play a role in iNKT cell fate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
