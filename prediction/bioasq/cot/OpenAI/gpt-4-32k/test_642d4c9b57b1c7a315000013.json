    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Luminopsins are indeed fusion proteins, but they are not a fusion of luminol and rhodopsin. Instead, they are a fusion of luciferase, which is a bioluminescent protein, and opsins, which are a group of light-sensitive proteins found in photoreceptor cells of the retina. Luminol is a chemical that produces light when oxidized, it is not a protein and therefore cannot be part of a fusion protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
