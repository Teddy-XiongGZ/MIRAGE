    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitochondria are organelles within a cell that are responsible for producing energy. They are too large to pass through membrane nanotubes. However, recent research has shown that mitochondria can indeed be transferred between cells through structures called tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). These are actin-based, bridge-like structures that connect two cells, allowing for the exchange of cellular components.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
