    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Crocus sativus, commonly known as saffron, has been used in traditional medicine for a long time. However, there is no scientific evidence or research that suggests that extracts from Crocus sativus can loosen the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that prevents solutes in the circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system where neurons reside. The properties of the blood-brain barrier change under different pathological conditions, but this is not linked to Crocus sativus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
