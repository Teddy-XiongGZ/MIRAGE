    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PPARG is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. Variants in this gene have been associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity, not type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It is not typically associated with genes involved in glucose metabolism or fatty acid storage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
