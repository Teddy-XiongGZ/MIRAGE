    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancers are sequences of DNA that can increase the likelihood of transcription of a particular gene. They can be located upstream or downstream from the gene they regulate. Negative enhancers, also known as silencers, are indeed a type of enhancer that can decrease the likelihood of transcription of a particular gene. Therefore, the answer is yes, there are negative enhancers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
