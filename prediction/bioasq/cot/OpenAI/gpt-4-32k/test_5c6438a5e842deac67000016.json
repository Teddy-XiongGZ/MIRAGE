    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Recessive coding variants refer to genetic mutations that are not expressed unless two copies of the gene are present. These variants can indeed cause diseases, but they are not the majority cause of undiagnosed conditions in nonconsanguineous individuals. Nonconsanguineous individuals, those who are not closely related, have a lower chance of carrying the same recessive variant. Therefore, other factors such as dominant variants, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices are more likely to be responsible for the majority of undiagnosed conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
