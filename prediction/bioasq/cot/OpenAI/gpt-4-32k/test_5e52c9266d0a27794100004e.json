    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"AhR, or Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the AHR gene. It is involved in the regulation of biological responses to planar aromatic hydrocarbons. Cyp1a1 is one of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) which are the enzymes involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. AhR ligands are indeed attractive drug targets because they can induce the expression of Cyp1a1, which can be beneficial in the metabolism of certain drugs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
