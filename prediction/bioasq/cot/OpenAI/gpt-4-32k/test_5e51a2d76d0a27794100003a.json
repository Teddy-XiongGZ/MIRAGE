    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Monoallelic expression refers to the expression of only one allele of a gene, rather than both. This means that only one variant of the gene is expressed, which could limit genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is increased when both alleles of a gene are expressed, as this allows for more variation in traits. Therefore, genes with monoallelic expression do not contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
