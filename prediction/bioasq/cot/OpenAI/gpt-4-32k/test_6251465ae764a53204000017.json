    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phospholemman is a member of the FXYD family of small ion transport regulators. It is known to regulate the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which is a crucial component of cellular function. This pump is located in the cell membrane, and since Phospholemman regulates this pump, it must also be located in the cell membrane. Therefore, Phospholemman is a membrane protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
