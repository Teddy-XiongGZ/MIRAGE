    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1) is a genetic disorder that is typically caused by mutations in the KMT2D gene. Missense variants in this gene can indeed cause the syndrome. However, it's important to note that not all missense variants will necessarily lead to the disease, as it depends on the specific location and nature of the mutation. In this case, the question is asking about exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants. To answer this question definitively, one would need to refer to specific scientific research or genetic databases that have documented cases of KS1 caused by these specific exon mutations. Without that information, it's impossible to say for sure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
