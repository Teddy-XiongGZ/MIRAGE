    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"AZD5153 is a BRD4 inhibitor. BRD4 is a protein that plays a key role in the progression of various cancers, including prostate cancer. Therefore, if AZD5153 is a BRD4 inhibitor, it should theoretically be active in prostate cancer. However, without specific clinical trial data or research studies confirming this, it's not possible to definitively say whether AZD5153 is active in prostate cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
