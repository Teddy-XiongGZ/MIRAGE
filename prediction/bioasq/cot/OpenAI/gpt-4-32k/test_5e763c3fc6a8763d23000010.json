    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question requires knowledge about the licensing history of the drug Vivotif. Vivotif is a vaccine used to prevent typhoid fever. The licensing process for drugs varies by region and is controlled by different regulatory bodies. In Europe, it's the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and in the US, it's the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
