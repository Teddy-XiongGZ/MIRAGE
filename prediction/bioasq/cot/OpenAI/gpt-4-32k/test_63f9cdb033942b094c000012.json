    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SRRM4 is a protein that promotes the inclusion of microexons in the final mRNA transcript. Therefore, if SRRM4 is silenced, it would not be available to promote the inclusion of microexons. This means that silencing SRRM4 would likely lead to a decrease in microexon inclusion, not an increase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
