    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hodgkin disease is a type of lymphoma, which is a blood cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. The treatment for Hodgkin disease often involves radiotherapy. Radiotherapy uses high-energy rays (similar to X-rays) to kill cancer cells. However, this treatment can also damage healthy cells in the process, potentially leading to secondary cancers.

Therefore, radiotherapy for Hodgkin disease can increase the risk for lung cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
