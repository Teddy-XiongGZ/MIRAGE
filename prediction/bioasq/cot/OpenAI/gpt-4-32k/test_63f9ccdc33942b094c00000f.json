    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PRP-40 is a protein that is involved in the splicing process of pre-mRNA. Microexons are very small exons that are also spliced into the mature mRNA. Therefore, since PRP-40 is involved in the splicing process, it is likely that it is also involved in microexon splicing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
