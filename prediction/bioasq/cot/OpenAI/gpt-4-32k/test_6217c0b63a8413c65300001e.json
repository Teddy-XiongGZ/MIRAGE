    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"UBE4B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is responsible for protein degradation. Some studies have shown that UBE4B is overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma, suggesting that it may play a role in promoting the disease. However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of UBE4B in renal cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
