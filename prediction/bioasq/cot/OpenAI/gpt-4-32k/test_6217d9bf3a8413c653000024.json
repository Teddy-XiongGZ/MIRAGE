Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in tryptophan catabolism to kynurenine. IFNg has been shown to induce the expression of IDO in various cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells, as a part of the immune response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
