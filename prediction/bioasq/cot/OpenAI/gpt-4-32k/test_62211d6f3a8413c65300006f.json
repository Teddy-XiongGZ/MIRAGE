    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CircRNAs, or circular RNAs, are a type of RNA which, unlike linear RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop. This circular structure makes them resistant to degradation by exonucleases such as RNase R, which typically degrade linear RNAs from their ends.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
