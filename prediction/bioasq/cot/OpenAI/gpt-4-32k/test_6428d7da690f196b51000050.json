    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Untranslated regions (UTRs) are parts of the mRNA that are not translated into protein, but they can still play a role in gene expression. They can influence how the mRNA is translated, its stability, and its location within the cell. Therefore, UTRs can indeed regulate gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
