    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the role of GRG5 in mouse development. GRG5, also known as Groucho-related-gene 5, is a transcriptional co-repressor involved in various developmental processes. While it does play a role in late embryonic development, it is not exclusive to this stage. GRG5 is also involved in early embryonic development and postnatal development. Therefore, it is not correct to say that GRG5 is involved only in late embryonic mouse development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
