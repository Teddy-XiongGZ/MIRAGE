    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The MEF2C gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development of various tissues and organs, including the brain. Mutations in this gene can cause developmental disorders. However, not only changes in the coding regions of MEF2C can cause developmental disorders. Changes in non-coding regions, such as regulatory regions that control the gene's activity, can also lead to disorders. Therefore, it's not only the coding regions that can cause disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
