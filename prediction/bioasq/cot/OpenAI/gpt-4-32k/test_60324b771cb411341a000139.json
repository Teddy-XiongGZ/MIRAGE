    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apilimod is a drug that has been identified as a potent inhibitor of the endosomal and lysosomal phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-5-kinase (PIKfyve). SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, relies on the host's endosomal system for entry into cells. Therefore, by inhibiting PIKfyve, Apilimod could potentially prevent the virus from entering host cells. Recent studies have shown that Apilimod has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
