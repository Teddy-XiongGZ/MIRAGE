    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Promoters are regions of DNA that initiate transcription of a particular gene. They are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream. The shape of a promoter is determined by the sequence of nucleotides it contains, which is dictated by the genetic code. Since genetic variation exists among populations, it is reasonable to assume that promoter shapes can also vary across populations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
