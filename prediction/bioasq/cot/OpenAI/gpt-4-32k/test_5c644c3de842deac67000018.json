    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cohesin is a protein complex that regulates the separation of sister chromatids during cell division. Recent studies have shown that cohesin and its regulatory proteins play a role in controlling gene expression, which can influence cell differentiation. Specifically, research has indicated that cohesin is involved in the regulation of myeloid differentiation, which is a process that leads to the formation of different types of white blood cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
