    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"De novo mutations are alterations in genes that are present for the first time in one family member as a result of a mutation in a germ cell (egg or sperm) of one of the parents, or in the fertilized egg itself. These mutations can occur in any part of the genome, including regulatory elements. Regulatory elements are crucial for controlling gene expression. If a de novo mutation occurs in a regulatory element of a gene important for neurodevelopment, it could potentially lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder. However, not all de novo mutations in regulatory elements will lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, as it depends on the specific gene and regulatory element affected, and the nature of the mutation. Therefore, while de novo mutations in regulatory elements can be responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders, they are not always the cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
