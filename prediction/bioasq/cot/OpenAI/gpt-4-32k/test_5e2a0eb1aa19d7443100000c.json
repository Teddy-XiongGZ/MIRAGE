    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PRL3-zumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets PRL3, a protein that is often overexpressed in various types of cancer. Studies have shown that PRL3-zumab can inhibit the growth of PRL3+ cancer cells in vitro (in a lab setting). Additionally, in vivo studies (in living organisms) have also demonstrated that PRL3-zumab can inhibit the growth of PRL3+ cancer cells. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
