    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noncoding RNAs are RNA molecules that do not code for proteins. They are classified into two main types: short noncoding RNAs and long noncoding RNAs. Short noncoding RNAs include microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, while long noncoding RNAs are longer than 200 nucleotides. Research has shown that these two types of noncoding RNAs can interact with each other. For example, long noncoding RNAs can act as molecular sponges to sequester microRNAs, thereby modulating their functions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
