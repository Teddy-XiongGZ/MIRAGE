    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"KCNQ1 is a gene that provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for maintaining the normal functions of the heart. Mutations in this gene can lead to arrhythmias. Modulating the splicing of KCNQ1 could potentially correct these mutations and restore the normal function of the protein, thereby preventing arrhythmias. However, this is a theoretical concept and the actual effectiveness would depend on the specific circumstances and the techniques used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
