    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CRISPR/Cas12a is a gene-editing tool that can be used to modify DNA sequences and regulate gene activity. It has been used in various applications, including the detection of specific genetic mutations. EGFR mutations are changes in the EGFR gene that can lead to abnormal cell growth and cancer. Circulating DNA refers to fragments of DNA that are released into the bloodstream, often from dying cells. Therefore, if the EGFR mutation is present in the circulating DNA, CRISPR/Cas12a should be able to detect it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
