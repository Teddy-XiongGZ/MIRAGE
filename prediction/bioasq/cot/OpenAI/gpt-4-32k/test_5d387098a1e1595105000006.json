    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"BTK, or Bruton's tyrosine kinase, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the development and functioning of B cells, which are a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies to fight off infections. Mutations in the BTK gene can lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a condition that affects the immune system and results in a reduced ability to fight off infections. Moreover, BTK inhibitors are used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, BTK is implicated in autoimmunity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
