    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SRRM4 is a splicing factor that is known to regulate neuronal-specific microexon splicing. TAF1 mRNA is a type of mRNA that can undergo splicing. Therefore, it is possible that SRRM4 could regulate the microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
