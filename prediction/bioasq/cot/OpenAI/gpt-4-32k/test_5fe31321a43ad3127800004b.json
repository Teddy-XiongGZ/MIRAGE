    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yeast FBP1 gene encodes for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis, a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates. When glucose is abundant, the FBP1 gene is repressed, meaning it is not active. However, during glucose starvation, the FBP1 gene is derepressed, or activated, to help generate glucose. Therefore, the yeast FBP1 is indeed affected by glucose starvation stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
