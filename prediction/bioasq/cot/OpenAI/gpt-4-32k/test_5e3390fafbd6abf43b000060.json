    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiotherapy is a treatment method that uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells. While it is effective in treating certain types of cancer, it can also cause damage to healthy cells and tissues near the treatment area. This damage can potentially lead to the development of a secondary cancer. In the case of cervical cancer, the colon is in close proximity to the cervix, and therefore, it could potentially be affected by the radiation. However, the risk is generally low and depends on various factors such as the dose of radiation, the area treated, and the patient's individual susceptibility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
