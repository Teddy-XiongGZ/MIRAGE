    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The functional fraction of the human genome refers to the portion of the genome that has a specific purpose or function. This includes genes that code for proteins, regulatory sequences that control gene expression, and other functional elements. Theoretically, there is no upper limit to the functional fraction of the human genome. As our understanding of the genome increases, we may discover more functional elements. Therefore, there is no upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
