    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GRHL2, or Grainyhead-like 2, is a transcription factor that has been shown to play a role in epithelial cell differentiation and barrier formation. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion, and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells. Studies have shown that GRHL2 actually suppresses EMT, rather than promoting it. Therefore, over-expression of GRHL2 would not lead to EMT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
