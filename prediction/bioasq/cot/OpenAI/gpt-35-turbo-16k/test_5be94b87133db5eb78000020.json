    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. Gene therapy is a technique that involves introducing genetic material into a person's cells to treat or prevent a disease. 2. Auditory function refers to the ability to hear and process sound. 3. In the context of gene therapy, restoring auditory function would involve using gene therapy to address any genetic abnormalities or mutations that are causing hearing loss or impairment. 4. Gene therapy has shown promise in treating certain genetic disorders that can cause hearing loss, such as certain types of deafness caused by mutations in specific genes. 5. However, it is important to note that the success of gene therapy in restoring auditory function would depend on the specific cause of the hearing loss and the underlying genetic factors involved. 6. Therefore, the answer to the question 'Can gene therapy restore auditory function?' is not a simple yes or no, as it would depend on the individual case and the specific genetic factors involved.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
