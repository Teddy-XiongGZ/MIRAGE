    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue. Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are a type of tumor that can occur in individuals with neurofibromatosis. Spinal Intradural Primary MPNSTs specifically refer to MPNSTs that develop within the spinal cord. To determine if these tumors are rare in neurofibromatosis patients, we need to consider the prevalence of MPNSTs in general and the likelihood of them occurring in the spinal cord. If MPNSTs are rare overall and have a low likelihood of occurring in the spinal cord, then Spinal Intradural Primary MPNSTs would also be rare in neurofibromatosis patients. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
