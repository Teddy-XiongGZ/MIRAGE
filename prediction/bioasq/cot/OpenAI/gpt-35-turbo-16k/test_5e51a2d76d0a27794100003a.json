    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genes with monoallelic expression are genes that are expressed from only one of the two alleles in a diploid organism. This means that only one copy of the gene is active, while the other copy is silenced. In humans, monoallelic expression can occur due to various mechanisms, such as genomic imprinting or X-chromosome inactivation in females. When considering genetic diversity, it is important to note that genetic diversity refers to the variation in genetic material within a population. This variation can arise from differences in alleles, which are alternative forms of a gene. Since genes with monoallelic expression are expressed from only one allele, they do not contribute to genetic diversity in the same way as genes with biallelic expression, where both alleles are active. Therefore, genes with monoallelic expression do not contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans. Based on this reasoning, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
