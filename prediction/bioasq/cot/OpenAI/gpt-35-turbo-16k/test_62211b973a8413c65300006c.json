    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. G-quadruplexes (G4) are secondary structures formed by guanine-rich DNA or RNA sequences. 2. Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer that is highly aggressive and difficult to treat. 3. G-quadruplexes have been found to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer. 4. Several studies have suggested that G-quadruplexes could be potential drug targets for cancer therapy, including glioblastoma. 5. These studies have shown that targeting G-quadruplexes can lead to inhibition of cancer cell growth and induce cell death. 6. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that G-quadruplexes are possible drug targets for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
