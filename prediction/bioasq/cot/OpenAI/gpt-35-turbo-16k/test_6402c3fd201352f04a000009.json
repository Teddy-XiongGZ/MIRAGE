The RIGHT-2 trial was a randomized controlled trial that investigated the use of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate in patients with suspected stroke. The trial compared the use of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate patches to placebo patches. To find the answer, we need to review the trial results and determine if the use of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate was found to be effective or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
