    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a type of immune cell that infiltrate the tumor microenvironment in gliomas. They have been shown to play a complex role in tumor progression and prognosis. TAMs can have both pro-tumoral and anti-tumoral functions depending on their polarization state. Some studies have suggested that high levels of TAM infiltration are associated with poor prognosis in gliomas, indicating a prognostic role. However, other studies have reported conflicting results, showing no significant association between TAMs and prognosis. Overall, the role of TAMs in glioma prognosis is still not fully understood and further research is needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
