    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if atenolol is metabolized by CYP2D6, we need to consider the known substrates of CYP2D6 and any available information on atenolol metabolism. CYP2D6 is a liver enzyme responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including beta blockers like metoprolol and propranolol. Atenolol is also a beta blocker, so it is possible that it could be metabolized by CYP2D6. However, to confirm this, we need to review the available literature or drug labeling information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
