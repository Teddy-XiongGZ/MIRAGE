    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if SMOC2 is expressed during wound healing, we need to consider the role of SMOC2 in wound healing and any available evidence of its expression. SMOC2 is a protein that belongs to the SPARC family and has been implicated in various biological processes, including tissue repair and regeneration. To determine if SMOC2 is expressed during wound healing, we can look for studies or research that specifically investigate SMOC2 expression in wound healing models or in human wound samples. By reviewing the available evidence, we can determine if SMOC2 is indeed expressed during wound healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
