    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) can be associated with a mutation of the Super Oxide Dismutase 1 (SOD) gene. ALS is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Mutations in the SOD1 gene have been found to be associated with a familial form of ALS, which accounts for about 10% of all ALS cases. These mutations lead to the production of abnormal SOD1 protein, which can be toxic to the nerve cells and contribute to the development of ALS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
