    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nanog is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. It is known to be highly expressed in pluripotent stem cells and is involved in the regulation of pluripotency genes. Therefore, it is unlikely that Nanog is repressed in pluripotent stem cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
