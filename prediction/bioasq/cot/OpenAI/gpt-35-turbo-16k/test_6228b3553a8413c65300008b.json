    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNA that form a covalently closed continuous loop structure. 2. They are generated through a process called back-splicing, where a downstream splice donor site is joined to an upstream splice acceptor site, resulting in a circular RNA molecule. 3. CircRNAs have been found to have various functions in gene regulation, including acting as microRNA sponges and interacting with RNA-binding proteins. 4. While circRNAs have been extensively studied in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, their role in diseases of the eye is still being investigated. 5. Some studies have suggested that circRNAs may play a role in eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma. 6. However, more research is needed to fully understand the involvement of circRNAs in eye diseases. Based on the available evidence, the answer is A. yes, circRNAs are implicated in diseases of the eye.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
