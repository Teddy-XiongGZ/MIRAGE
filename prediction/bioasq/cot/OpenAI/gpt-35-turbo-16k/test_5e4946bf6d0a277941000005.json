    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) and topologically associating domains (TADs) are both structural features of the genome that play a role in gene regulation. GRBs are regions of the genome that contain clusters of genes with similar expression patterns and are thought to be involved in the regulation of these genes. TADs, on the other hand, are three-dimensional structures formed by the looping of DNA, and they help to organize the genome into functional units. While both GRBs and TADs are involved in gene regulation, they are not the same thing. GRBs are specific regions of the genome that contain clusters of genes, whereas TADs are larger structural units that help to organize the genome. Therefore, the answer is A. yes, GRBs are different than TADs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
