    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if MEDI2228 is a bispecific antibody, we need to understand what a bispecific antibody is. Bispecific antibodies are designed to bind to two different targets simultaneously. They are engineered to have two different binding sites, allowing them to bind to two different antigens. MEDI2228 is a bispecific antibody that targets both CD3 and CD123, making it capable of binding to both antigens at the same time. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
