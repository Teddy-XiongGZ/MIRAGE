    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ultraconserved enhancers are DNA sequences that are highly conserved across species and are believed to play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development. To determine if ultraconserved enhancers are important for normal development, we need to consider the evidence. Several studies have shown that mutations or deletions in ultraconserved enhancers can lead to developmental abnormalities or diseases. Additionally, these enhancers have been found to be active in specific tissues and at specific developmental stages. This suggests that they are indeed important for normal development. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
