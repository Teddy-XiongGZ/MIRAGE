    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if tivantinib is effective for MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma, we need to review the available evidence. Tivantinib is a selective MET inhibitor that has been studied in various types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma. MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in tumor growth and progression. MET-high status refers to the overexpression or activation of MET in cancer cells. To determine if tivantinib is effective for MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma, we need to consider the results of clinical trials specifically evaluating tivantinib in this patient population. Therefore, we need to review the available clinical trial data on tivantinib in MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
