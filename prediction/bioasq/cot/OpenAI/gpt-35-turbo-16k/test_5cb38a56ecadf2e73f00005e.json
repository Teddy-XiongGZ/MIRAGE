    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if myc is a tumor suppressor gene, we need to consider its function. Tumor suppressor genes are responsible for regulating cell growth and preventing the formation of tumors. They typically act as a brake on cell division. If myc functions as a tumor suppressor gene, it would inhibit cell growth and prevent tumor formation. On the other hand, if myc promotes cell growth and contributes to tumor formation, it would not be considered a tumor suppressor gene. Therefore, we need to determine whether myc inhibits or promotes cell growth and tumor formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
