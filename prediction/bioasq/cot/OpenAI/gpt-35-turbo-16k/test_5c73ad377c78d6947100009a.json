    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether Panitumumab prolongs survival of biliary tract cancer patients, we need to review relevant clinical studies. We should look for randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews/meta-analyses that have investigated the use of Panitumumab in biliary tract cancer patients. These studies should compare the survival outcomes of patients who received Panitumumab with those who did not receive it. By examining the results of these studies, we can determine whether Panitumumab has a significant impact on the survival of biliary tract cancer patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
