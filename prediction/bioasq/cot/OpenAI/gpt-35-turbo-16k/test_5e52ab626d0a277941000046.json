    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if promoter shape varies across populations, we need to consider the genetic diversity among different populations. Promoters are regions of DNA that play a crucial role in gene expression. Genetic variations can lead to differences in promoter sequences, which in turn can affect gene expression levels. Therefore, if there is genetic diversity among populations, it is possible that promoter shape may vary across populations. To answer the question, we need to consider studies that have investigated genetic diversity and promoter sequences in different populations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
