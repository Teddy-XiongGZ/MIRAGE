    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive brain tumor that occurs in children. Valproic acid is an antiepileptic drug that has been studied for its potential anticancer effects. To determine if the addition of valproic acid improves survival of patients with DIPG, we need to review the available evidence. The most reliable source of evidence would be randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of valproic acid with a control group. We should search for systematic reviews or meta-analyses that have summarized the results of multiple RCTs. By reviewing the available evidence, we can determine if there is a significant improvement in survival with the addition of valproic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
