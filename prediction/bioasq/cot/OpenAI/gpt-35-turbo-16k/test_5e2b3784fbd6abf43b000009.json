    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if GRG5 is involved only in late embryonic mouse development, we need to consider the available evidence. One way to do this is to review the scientific literature and studies that have investigated the role of GRG5 in mouse development. We can also consider any known functions or interactions of GRG5 that may provide insights into its involvement in embryonic development. Finally, we can look for any experimental evidence or data that specifically address the timing of GRG5's involvement in mouse development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
