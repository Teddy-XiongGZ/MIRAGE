    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Luminopsins are not fusion proteins of luminol and Rhodopsin. Luminopsins are actually a class of genetically engineered proteins that combine the light-sensing properties of rhodopsin with the light-emitting properties of luciferase. They are used in optogenetics to control the activity of neurons using light. Therefore, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
