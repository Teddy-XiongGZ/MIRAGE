    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether stretch enhancers are transcribed more than super-enhancers, we need to understand the characteristics of both types of enhancers. Stretch enhancers are typically shorter in length and have lower levels of transcription compared to super-enhancers. Super-enhancers, on the other hand, are longer in length and have higher levels of transcription. Based on this information, it is likely that super-enhancers are transcribed more than stretch enhancers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
