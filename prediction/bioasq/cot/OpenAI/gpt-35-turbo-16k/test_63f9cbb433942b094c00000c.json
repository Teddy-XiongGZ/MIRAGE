    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alternative splicing is a process in which different combinations of exons are included or excluded from the final mRNA transcript, resulting in the production of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene. Heart disease is a broad term that encompasses various conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. To determine if alternative splicing is associated with heart disease, we need to consider the role of alternative splicing in the development and progression of heart disease. Research studies have shown that alternative splicing plays a significant role in cardiac development, function, and disease. It can influence the expression of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, heart failure, and other cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, the answer to the question is A. yes, alternative splicing is associated with heart disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
