    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if lucatumumab is a polyclonal antibody, we need to understand the characteristics of polyclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies are produced by multiple B cell clones and recognize multiple epitopes on the target antigen. Lucatumumab is a monoclonal antibody, which means it is produced by a single B cell clone and recognizes a single epitope on the target antigen. Therefore, lucatumumab is not a polyclonal antibody.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
