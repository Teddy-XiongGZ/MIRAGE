    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Astrocytes are a type of glial cell in the central nervous system. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid. It is formed by specialized endothelial cells lining the blood vessels in the brain. These endothelial cells are connected by tight junctions that restrict the passage of substances from the blood into the brain. Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and function of the BBB. They surround the blood vessels and provide structural support, regulate blood flow, and release various factors that influence the permeability of the BBB. Therefore, astrocytes are indeed part of the blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
