    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MEF2C is a gene that codes for a transcription factor involved in the development of various tissues and organs. Developmental disorders can result from changes in the coding regions of MEF2C, as these changes can alter the structure or function of the protein it produces. However, it is also possible for changes in non-coding regions of the gene to cause developmental disorders. Non-coding regions can contain regulatory elements that control the expression of the gene. Therefore, changes in these regions can disrupt the normal regulation of MEF2C and lead to developmental disorders. Based on this information, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
