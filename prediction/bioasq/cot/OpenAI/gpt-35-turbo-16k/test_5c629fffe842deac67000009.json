    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) has a role only in late development, we need to consider the available evidence. First, we can review the literature and research studies that have investigated the function of GRG5. Second, we can examine the expression pattern of GRG5 during different stages of development. Finally, we can analyze any known phenotypes or effects associated with the loss or overexpression of GRG5. By considering these factors, we can determine whether GRG5 has a role only in late development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
