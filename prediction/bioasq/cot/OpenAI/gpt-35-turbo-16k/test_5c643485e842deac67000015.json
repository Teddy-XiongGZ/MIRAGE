    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. De novo mutations are genetic mutations that occur for the first time in an individual and are not inherited from their parents.\\n2. Regulatory elements are regions of DNA that control the expression of genes.\\n3. Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of disorders that affect the development of the nervous system.\\n4. De novo mutations in regulatory elements can disrupt the normal gene expression patterns, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental disorders.\\n5. Therefore, the answer is yes, de novo mutations in regulatory elements can be responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
