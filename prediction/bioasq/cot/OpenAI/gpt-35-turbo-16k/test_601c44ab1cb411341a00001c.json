Radiosurgery is a non-invasive treatment that uses focused radiation beams to target and destroy tumors. 3. In the case of DNET tumors, the primary treatment approach is surgical resection, which involves removing the tumor through surgery. 4. Radiosurgery is typically not used as the primary treatment for DNET tumors because they are benign and can often be completely removed through surgery. 5. However, in some cases where complete surgical resection is not possible or if the tumor recurs after surgery, radiosurgery may be considered as an alternative treatment option. 6. Therefore, the answer to the question is A. yes, radiosurgery can be used for DNET tumors, but it is not the primary treatment approach.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
