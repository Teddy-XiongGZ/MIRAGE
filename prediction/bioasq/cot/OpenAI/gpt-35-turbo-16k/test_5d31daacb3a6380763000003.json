    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The KRAB-ZNF gene family is a group of genes that encode for proteins called KRAB-ZNF transcription factors. These transcription factors have a KRAB domain and multiple zinc finger domains. The KRAB domain is known to recruit co-repressor proteins, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are involved in gene repression. Therefore, based on the known function of the KRAB domain in recruiting co-repressors, it is likely that members of the KRAB-ZNF gene family promote gene repression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
