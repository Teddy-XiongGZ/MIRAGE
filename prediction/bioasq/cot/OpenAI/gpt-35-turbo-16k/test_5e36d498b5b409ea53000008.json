    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if de novo truncating mutations in WASF1 cause cancer, we need to consider the role of WASF1 in cancer development. WASF1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. Mutations in WASF1 have been associated with a rare genetic disorder called Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), which is characterized by immune deficiency and an increased risk of developing certain cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia. However, it is important to note that these mutations are not de novo truncating mutations, but rather inherited mutations. De novo truncating mutations refer to new mutations that occur for the first time in an individual and are not inherited from their parents. Given this information, we can conclude that de novo truncating mutations in WASF1 do not cause cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
