    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CircRNAs are circular RNA molecules that are formed by back-splicing of exons. They are known to be resistant to degradation by exonucleases due to their circular structure. RNase R is an exonuclease that degrades linear RNA molecules but does not have the ability to degrade circular RNA molecules. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
