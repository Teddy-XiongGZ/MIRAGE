    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yeast prions are self-propagating protein aggregates that can cause heritable phenotypic traits in yeast. Amyloid diseases in humans, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are also characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Therefore, studying yeast prions could provide insights into the basic mechanisms underlying human amyloid diseases. Based on this information, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
