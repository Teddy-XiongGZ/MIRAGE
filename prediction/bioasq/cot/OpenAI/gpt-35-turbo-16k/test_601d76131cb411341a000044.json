    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if avelumab is effective for urothelial carcinoma, we need to review the available evidence. Avelumab is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma. It works by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1), which helps to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells. To confirm its effectiveness, we need to consider clinical trials and studies that have evaluated the use of avelumab in urothelial carcinoma patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
