    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) are effective for the treatment of stroke, we need to consider the available evidence. First, we can review any relevant clinical trials or studies that have been conducted on the use of MAPCs for stroke treatment. Second, we can examine the results of these studies to see if there is evidence of improved outcomes in stroke patients who received MAPC treatment. Finally, we can consider any potential limitations or conflicting evidence that may exist. Based on this information, we can then make a determination on whether MAPCs are effective for the treatment of stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
