The radiation used in radiotherapy can affect not only the cancer cells but also the surrounding healthy tissues. 3. The bladder is located near the prostate, and it can be exposed to radiation during prostate cancer radiotherapy. 4. Exposure to radiation is a known risk factor for developing cancer. 5. Therefore, it is possible that radiotherapy for prostate cancer could increase the risk of bladder cancer. 6. To determine if radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases bladder cancer risk, we need to examine scientific studies and evidence. 7. Based on the available evidence, the answer to the question is: A. yes, radiotherapy for prostate cancer can increase bladder cancer risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
