    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Flotillin can be used as an exosomal marker, we need to consider its characteristics and its presence in exosomes. Flotillin is a protein that is known to be associated with lipid rafts, which are microdomains in the cell membrane. Exosomes are small vesicles that are released by cells and contain various biomolecules, including proteins. To determine if Flotillin can be used as an exosomal marker, we need to check if it is present in exosomes. If Flotillin is consistently found in exosomes, it can be considered as an exosomal marker. If not, it cannot be used as an exosomal marker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
