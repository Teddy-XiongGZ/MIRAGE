    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MCL-1 is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which are known to regulate apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family consists of both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. Anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival. On the other hand, pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, promote apoptosis. MCL-1 is classified as an anti-apoptotic protein because it functions to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
