    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancers are DNA sequences that can increase the transcription of specific genes. They can be located upstream, downstream, or even within a gene. Enhancers work by binding to specific transcription factors, which then recruit RNA polymerase to the gene promoter, leading to increased gene expression. Enhancers are not directional in their targeting of gene promoters. They can interact with gene promoters located upstream, downstream, or even on different chromosomes. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
