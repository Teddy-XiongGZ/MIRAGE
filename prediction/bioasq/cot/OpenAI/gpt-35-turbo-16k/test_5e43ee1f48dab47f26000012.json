    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Circular exons are a type of alternative splicing event where the exon is spliced back onto itself, forming a circular RNA molecule. Circular RNAs have been shown to have various functions in gene regulation, including acting as microRNA sponges and regulating transcription. However, the specific effect of circular exons on gene expression is not well understood. It is possible that circular exons could increase gene expression by stabilizing the mRNA molecule or by promoting translation. On the other hand, circular exons could also have a negative effect on gene expression by disrupting the normal splicing process. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to definitively say whether circular exons increase gene expression or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
