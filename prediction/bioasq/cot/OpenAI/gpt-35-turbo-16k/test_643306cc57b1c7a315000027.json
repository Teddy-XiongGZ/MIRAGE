    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, CRISPR/Cas12a can be used for the detection of EGFR mutations in circulating DNA. CRISPR/Cas12a is a gene-editing tool that can be repurposed for diagnostic purposes. It can be programmed to specifically target and cleave DNA sequences that are associated with EGFR mutations. By using CRISPR/Cas12a, researchers can detect the presence of EGFR mutations in circulating DNA samples through a process called CRISPR-based diagnostic assay. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
