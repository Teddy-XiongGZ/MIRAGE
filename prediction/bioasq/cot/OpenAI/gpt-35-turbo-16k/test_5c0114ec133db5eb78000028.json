    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gepotidacin is a novel antibiotic that belongs to the class of topoisomerase inhibitors. Topoisomerase is an enzyme that helps in the regulation of DNA topology by introducing or removing supercoils in the DNA molecule. Inhibition of topoisomerase activity can lead to DNA damage and ultimately cell death in bacteria. Therefore, it is expected that gepotidacin activates bacterial topoisomerase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
