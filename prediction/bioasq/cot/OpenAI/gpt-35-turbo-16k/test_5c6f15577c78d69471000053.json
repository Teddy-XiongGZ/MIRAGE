    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if galcanezumab is effective for the treatment of migraine, we need to review the available evidence. Galcanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is believed to play a role in migraine pathophysiology. Clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of galcanezumab in reducing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. These trials typically compare galcanezumab to a placebo or standard treatment. By reviewing the results of these trials, we can determine if galcanezumab is effective for the treatment of migraine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
