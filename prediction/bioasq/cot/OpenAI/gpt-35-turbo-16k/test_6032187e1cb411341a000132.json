    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gram positive bacteria are able to release extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles are small membrane-bound structures that are released by cells and contain various molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. They play important roles in intercellular communication and can be involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Gram positive bacteria, which have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell wall, are known to release extracellular vesicles. These vesicles can contain virulence factors, toxins, and other molecules that can be important for bacterial pathogenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
