    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intepirdine is a drug that was initially developed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. It works by blocking a certain receptor in the brain called the 5-HT6 receptor, which is believed to play a role in memory and cognition. However, clinical trials of Intepirdine have not shown significant benefits in improving cognitive function or slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, a large Phase 3 clinical trial called the MINDSET study was terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Based on the available evidence, it is not recommended to use Intepirdine for Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
