    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Mediator is present at super enhancers, we need to consider the role of Mediator and the characteristics of super enhancers. Mediator is a multi-subunit protein complex that acts as a bridge between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, facilitating the initiation and regulation of gene transcription. Super enhancers, on the other hand, are large clusters of enhancers that drive high levels of gene expression. They are characterized by the presence of high levels of transcription factors and coactivators. Given the role of Mediator in transcriptional regulation, it is possible that Mediator is present at super enhancers to facilitate gene expression. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
