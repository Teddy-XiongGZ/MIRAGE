    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancers do not have to be close to their gene targets. Enhancers are DNA sequences that can be located far away from the genes they regulate. They can interact with their target genes through DNA looping and other mechanisms. This long-range interaction allows enhancers to activate or enhance gene expression even if they are located at a considerable distance from the gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
