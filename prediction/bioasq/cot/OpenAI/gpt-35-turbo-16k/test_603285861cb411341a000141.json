    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are indeed induced by microbes. TLRs are a type of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that recognize specific molecular patterns associated with microbes, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or viral nucleic acids. When TLRs recognize these microbial patterns, they initiate an immune response to eliminate the invading microbes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
