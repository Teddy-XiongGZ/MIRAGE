    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the NLM medical text indexer (MTI) is still useful and relevant, we need to consider several factors. First, we can look at the purpose of the MTI, which is to automatically assign MeSH terms to biomedical articles. If this task is still necessary and valuable, then the MTI could still be useful. Second, we can examine the performance of the MTI. If it consistently produces accurate and relevant MeSH term assignments, then it would be considered relevant. Third, we can consider any alternative methods or technologies that may have emerged since the development of the MTI. If there are more advanced or efficient methods available, the relevance of the MTI may be diminished. Finally, we can look at the usage and adoption of the MTI within the medical community. If it is widely used and trusted by researchers, it would indicate its continued usefulness and relevance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
