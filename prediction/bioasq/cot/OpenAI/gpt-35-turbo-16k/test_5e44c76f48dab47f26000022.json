    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Aptiganel is effective for the treatment of stroke, we need to review the available evidence. Aptiganel is a drug that acts as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, which means it blocks the activity of a specific type of receptor in the brain. Stroke is a medical condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, leading to brain damage. To assess the effectiveness of Aptiganel for stroke treatment, we need to consider clinical trials and studies that have evaluated its efficacy and safety in stroke patients. Based on the available evidence, we can then determine if Aptiganel is effective or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
