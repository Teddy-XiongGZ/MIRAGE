    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through breast milk, we need to consider the available evidence. First, it is known that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. However, the transmission through breast milk is still under investigation. Second, studies have been conducted to analyze breast milk samples from mothers with COVID-19, and some studies have detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk. However, the presence of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that the virus is viable or infectious. Third, there have been reports of newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 shortly after birth, but it is unclear whether the transmission occurred through breast milk or during the birthing process. Given the available evidence, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of breastfeeding in consultation with healthcare professionals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
