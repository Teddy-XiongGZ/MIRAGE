    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nivolumab (Opdivo) is a monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on immune cells. PD-1 is a checkpoint protein that regulates the immune response. When PD-1 binds to its ligand, programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), it inhibits the activity of immune cells. Therefore, by blocking PD-1, nivolumab enhances the immune response against cancer cells. However, nivolumab itself does not directly inhibit PD-L1. Instead, it prevents the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1, which indirectly leads to the inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
