    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if AZD3759 crosses the blood brain barrier, we need to consider its properties. AZD3759 is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation. The ability of a drug to cross the blood brain barrier depends on its molecular size, lipophilicity, and presence of efflux transporters. Since AZD3759 is a small molecule, it has a higher chance of crossing the blood brain barrier. Additionally, it has been specifically designed to target EGFR mutations in the brain, indicating that it is likely to cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
