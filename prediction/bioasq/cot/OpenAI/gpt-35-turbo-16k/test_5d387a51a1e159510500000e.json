    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if CXorf21 escapes X chromosome inactivation, we need to consider its location on the X chromosome. If CXorf21 is located on the X chromosome, it should undergo X chromosome inactivation. If it is located on an autosome or the Y chromosome, it would not undergo X chromosome inactivation. Therefore, we need to determine the location of CXorf21 to answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
