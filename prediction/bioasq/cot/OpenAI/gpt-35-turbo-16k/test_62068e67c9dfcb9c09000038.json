    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders that affect the mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy in cells. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a technique that can analyze the complete set of DNA in an individual, including both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Therefore, WGS has the potential to identify genetic variants in both nuclear and mitochondrial genes that may be associated with mitochondrial disease. However, it is important to note that WGS may not be the first-line diagnostic test for mitochondrial disease. Other targeted genetic tests, such as mitochondrial DNA sequencing or nuclear gene panel testing, may be more commonly used for initial diagnosis. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
