Severity: COVID-19 tends to cause more severe illness compared to influenza, with a higher risk of complications and hospitalization. 3. Transmission: COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and can spread easily, while influenza can also spread through respiratory droplets but is generally less contagious. 4. Testing: Diagnostic tests are available to specifically detect COVID-19, such as PCR tests or antigen tests. Influenza can also be diagnosed through similar tests. 5. Epidemiology: The prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza can vary depending on the region and time of year. COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic, while influenza is more seasonal.
