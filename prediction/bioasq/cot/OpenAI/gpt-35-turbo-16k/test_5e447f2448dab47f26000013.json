    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA molecule that do not code for proteins but have been found to play important regulatory roles in gene expression. 2. Neuronal outgrowth refers to the extension of neuronal processes, such as axons and dendrites, during development. 3. Numerous studies have identified lncRNAs that are involved in various aspects of neuronal development and function. 4. Some lncRNAs have been shown to regulate the extent of neuronal outgrowth by influencing the expression of genes involved in axon guidance, synapse formation, and other processes. 5. Therefore, the answer to the question is A. yes, there are lncRNAs that control the extent of neuronal outgrowth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
