    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CircRNA is produced by back splicing of exons, which are the coding regions of genes. In this process, a downstream splice donor site is joined to an upstream splice acceptor site, resulting in a circular RNA molecule. Therefore, the correct answer is exon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
