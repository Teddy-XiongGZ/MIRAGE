    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if nintedanib holds promise for lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis, we need to review the available evidence. Nintedanib is a medication that has been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a condition characterized by progressive scarring of the lungs. Systemic sclerosis is a connective tissue disease that can also lead to lung involvement, including interstitial lung disease (ILD). Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nintedanib in treating ILD associated with systemic sclerosis. These trials have shown that nintedanib can slow the decline in lung function and reduce the risk of acute exacerbations in patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is A. yes, nintedanib holds promise for lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
