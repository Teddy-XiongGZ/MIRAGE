    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"AhR ligands are attractive drug targets for pharmaceutical development due to their induction of Cyp1a1. Cyp1a1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which are responsible for metabolizing a wide range of drugs and toxins in the body. Induction of Cyp1a1 by AhR ligands can enhance the metabolism and elimination of drugs, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes and reduced toxicity. Therefore, the statement is true and the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
