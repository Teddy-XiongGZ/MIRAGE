    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether silencing of SRRM4 promotes microexon inclusion, we need to understand the role of SRRM4 in splicing regulation. SRRM4 is a splicing factor that has been shown to promote inclusion of microexons in certain genes. Therefore, if we silence SRRM4, it is expected that the promotion of microexon inclusion would be reduced or inhibited. Based on this information, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
