    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if sacituzumab govitecan is effective for breast cancer, we need to review the available evidence. Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets Trop-2, a protein found on the surface of many cancer cells, including breast cancer cells. It consists of an antibody that specifically binds to Trop-2 and a chemotherapy drug, SN-38, which is released inside the cancer cells to kill them. To assess its effectiveness, we need to consider clinical trials and studies that have evaluated the use of sacituzumab govitecan in breast cancer patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
