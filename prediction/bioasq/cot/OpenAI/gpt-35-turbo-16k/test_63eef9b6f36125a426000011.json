    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Prasinezumab is effective for Parkinson's Disease, we need to review the available evidence. Prasinezumab is an experimental monoclonal antibody that targets alpha-synuclein, a protein that forms abnormal clumps in the brains of people with Parkinson's Disease. It is designed to reduce the accumulation of alpha-synuclein and potentially slow down the progression of the disease. To answer the question, we need to consider the results of clinical trials and studies that have investigated the efficacy of Prasinezumab in treating Parkinson's Disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
