    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amblyopia, also known as lazy eye, is a condition that affects vision. It occurs when there is a problem with the development of the visual system, typically during childhood. The brain and the eye are both involved in the development of amblyopia. The most common cause of amblyopia is strabismus, which is a misalignment of the eyes. In this condition, one eye may turn inwards, outwards, upwards, or downwards, causing the brain to suppress the image from that eye. Another cause of amblyopia is a significant difference in the refractive error between the two eyes, such as one eye being more nearsighted, farsighted, or having more astigmatism than the other. This can lead to the brain favoring the eye with better vision and ignoring the image from the other eye. Therefore, amblyopia does affect the eye.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
