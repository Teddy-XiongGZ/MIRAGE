    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"LOQ and LOD are abbreviations used in analytical chemistry. LOQ stands for Limit of Quantification, which is the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be reliably measured and quantified. LOD stands for Limit of Detection, which is the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be reliably detected, but not necessarily quantified. Based on these definitions, LOQ and LOD are not the same. LOQ is a lower concentration than LOD because it represents the point at which the analyte can be reliably quantified, whereas LOD represents the point at which the analyte can be reliably detected. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
