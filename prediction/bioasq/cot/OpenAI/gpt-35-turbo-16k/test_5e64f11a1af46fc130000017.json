    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Paramyxoviruses are a family of viruses that have a single-stranded RNA genome. The genome of paramyxoviruses is indeed segmented, meaning it is divided into multiple separate RNA molecules. Additionally, the RNA genome of paramyxoviruses is negative-sense, which means it is complementary to the viral mRNA and requires transcription to produce viral proteins. Therefore, the correct answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
