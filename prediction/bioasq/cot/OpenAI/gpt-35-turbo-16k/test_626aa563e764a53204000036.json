    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if pRETRO-SUPER is an adenoviral vector, we need to consider its characteristics. Adenoviral vectors are derived from adenoviruses and are commonly used in gene therapy. They have a high capacity for carrying genetic material and can efficiently infect a wide range of cell types. pRETRO-SUPER, on the other hand, is a plasmid vector commonly used for RNA interference (RNAi) studies. It is not derived from adenoviruses and does not possess the characteristics of an adenoviral vector. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
