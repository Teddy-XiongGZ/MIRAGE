    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that are released by cells and can be found in various body fluids. Flow cytometry is a commonly used technique to analyze cells and particles based on their size and surface markers. FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting) is a specialized form of flow cytometry that allows for the separation and collection of specific cell populations based on their fluorescence signals. Exosomes are typically smaller than cells and may not have sufficient fluorescence signals to be detected and sorted by FACS. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
