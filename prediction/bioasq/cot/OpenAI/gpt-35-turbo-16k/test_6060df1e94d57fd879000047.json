    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, there is an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome. The human genome consists of all the genetic material present in a human cell. However, not all parts of the genome are functional or actively involved in gene expression. Only a portion of the genome is considered to be functional, meaning it contains genes or regulatory elements that have a specific function. The rest of the genome is often referred to as non-functional or junk DNA. While the exact proportion of functional versus non-functional DNA is still a topic of debate, it is widely accepted that the functional fraction of the human genome is limited. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
