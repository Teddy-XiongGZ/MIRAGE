    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. Tyrosine kinase BTK is known to play a crucial role in B-cell development and function. 2. Autoimmunity is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. 3. Since BTK is involved in the regulation of B-cell signaling and activation, it is possible that dysregulation of BTK could contribute to autoimmunity. 4. Several studies have shown that BTK inhibitors can be effective in treating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 5. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that the tyrosine kinase BTK is indeed implicated in autoimmunity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
