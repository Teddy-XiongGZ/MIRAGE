    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. FTO is a gene that encodes for an enzyme called fat mass and obesity-associated protein. 2. Studies have shown that FTO is involved in the regulation of body weight and energy balance. 3. Pancreatic cancer is a complex disease with multiple risk factors, including genetic and environmental factors. 4. There is evidence to suggest that FTO may play a role in the development of pancreatic cancer. 5. Several studies have found an association between certain variants of the FTO gene and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. 6. These variants may affect the expression or function of FTO, leading to alterations in cellular processes that contribute to cancer development. 7. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is A. yes, FTO can promote pancreatic cancer development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
