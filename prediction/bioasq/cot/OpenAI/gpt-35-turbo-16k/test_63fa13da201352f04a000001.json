    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if PRP-40 regulation of microexons is a conserved phenomenon, we need to consider the available evidence. First, we can review the literature and research studies that have investigated this topic. We can look for studies that have examined the role of PRP-40 in the regulation of microexons across different species. Additionally, we can consider if there are any known evolutionary conservation patterns of PRP-40 and microexon regulation. By evaluating these sources of information, we can determine if PRP-40 regulation of microexons is a conserved phenomenon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
