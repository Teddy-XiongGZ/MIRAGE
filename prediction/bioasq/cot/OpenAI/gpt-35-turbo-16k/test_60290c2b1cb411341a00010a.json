    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if there is high nucleotide diversity in the Drosophila suzukii species, we need to consider the genetic variation within the species. One way to measure genetic variation is by looking at nucleotide diversity, which refers to the average number of nucleotide differences between any two individuals in a population. To answer this question, we can look at studies or research that have specifically investigated the nucleotide diversity in Drosophila suzukii. Based on the available information, we can then choose the appropriate answer choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
