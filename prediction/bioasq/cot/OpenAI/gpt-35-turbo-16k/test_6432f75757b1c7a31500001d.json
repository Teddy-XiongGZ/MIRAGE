    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Zanubrutinib is a first-generation BTK inhibitor approved by the US FDA, we need to gather information about Zanubrutinib and its approval status. First, we need to understand what a first-generation BTK inhibitor is. First-generation BTK inhibitors are drugs that target the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) enzyme and were among the first drugs developed in this class. Next, we need to find out if Zanubrutinib is a BTK inhibitor and if it has been approved by the US FDA. Finally, we can compare this information to determine if Zanubrutinib is a first-generation BTK inhibitor approved by the US FDA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
