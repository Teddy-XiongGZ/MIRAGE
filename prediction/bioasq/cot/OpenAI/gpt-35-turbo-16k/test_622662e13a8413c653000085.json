    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"METTL3 is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of a methyl group to RNA molecules. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA molecule that do not code for proteins. To determine if METTL3 can methylate lncRNAs, we need to consider if METTL3 has the ability to recognize and bind to lncRNAs and if it has the enzymatic activity to methylate them. Since METTL3 is known to methylate other types of RNA molecules, it is possible that it can also methylate lncRNAs. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
