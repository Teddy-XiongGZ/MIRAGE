    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if FKBP52 is encoding a chaperone, we need to understand what FKBP52 is. FKBP52 is a protein that belongs to the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family. Chaperones are proteins that assist in the folding and assembly of other proteins. To determine if FKBP52 is a chaperone, we can look at its known functions and interactions. If FKBP52 has been shown to interact with and assist in the folding or assembly of other proteins, then it can be considered a chaperone. If there is no evidence of such interactions, then it is not a chaperone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
