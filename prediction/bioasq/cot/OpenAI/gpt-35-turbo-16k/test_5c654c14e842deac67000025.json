    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if lucatumumab binds to CD140, we need to consider the properties of both lucatumumab and CD140. Lucatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets CD40, a cell surface receptor protein. CD140, on the other hand, is a receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since lucatumumab targets CD40 and not CD140, it does not bind to CD140. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
