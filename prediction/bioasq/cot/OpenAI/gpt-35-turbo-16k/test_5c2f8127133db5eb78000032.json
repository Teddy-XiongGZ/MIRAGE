    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether whole-genome duplications are more divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast, we need to consider the characteristics of each type of duplication. Whole-genome duplications involve the duplication of an entire genome, resulting in two identical copies. This can lead to significant changes in the genetic makeup of the organism. On the other hand, small-scale duplications involve the duplication of smaller segments of the genome, such as individual genes or small clusters of genes. These duplications may have less impact on the overall genetic diversity of the organism. Therefore, based on these characteristics, it is likely that whole-genome duplications are more divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
