    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Casimersen is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called antisense oligonucleotides. It is specifically designed to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. Exon skipping is a therapeutic approach that aims to restore the reading frame of the dystrophin gene, which is mutated in DMD. Casimersen works by binding to the dystrophin pre-mRNA and promoting the skipping of exon 45 during the splicing process, resulting in the production of a truncated but functional dystrophin protein. Clinical trials have shown that casimersen can increase dystrophin production in patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 45 skipping. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
