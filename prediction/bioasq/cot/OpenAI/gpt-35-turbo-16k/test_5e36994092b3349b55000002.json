    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"TET proteins are enzymes that play a role in DNA demethylation, which can affect gene expression and cell fate. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subset of T cells that have a unique phenotype and function. To determine if there is a role for TET proteins in iNKT cell fate, we need to consider if TET proteins are expressed in iNKT cells and if their activity affects the development or function of these cells. Research studies have shown that TET proteins are indeed expressed in iNKT cells and that their activity is important for the development and function of these cells. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
