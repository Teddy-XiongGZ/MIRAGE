    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether silencing of SRRM4 inhibits tumor growth across cancers, we need to consider the available evidence. One way to assess this is by looking at studies that have investigated the effects of silencing SRRM4 on tumor growth in different types of cancers. We should review the literature and examine the results of these studies. If there is consistent evidence showing that silencing SRRM4 inhibits tumor growth across different types of cancers, then the answer would be yes. However, if the studies show inconsistent or inconclusive results, or if there is a lack of studies on this topic, then the answer would be no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
