    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"IFNg stands for Interferon-gamma, which is a cytokine involved in immune response. IDO stands for Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of tryptophan. To determine if IFNg can induce the expression of IDO, we need to consider the known effects of IFNg on gene expression. IFNg is known to have immunomodulatory effects and can induce the expression of various genes involved in immune response. IDO is one such gene that can be induced by IFNg. Therefore, the answer is yes, IFNg can induce the expression of IDO.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
