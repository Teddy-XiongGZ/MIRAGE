    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if yeast fbp1 is affected by glucose starvation stress, we need to consider the role of fbp1 and the impact of glucose starvation on yeast metabolism. Fbp1 is an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis, which is the process of synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. Glucose starvation stress occurs when there is a lack of glucose available for energy production. In this condition, yeast cells would need to rely on alternative carbon sources and activate gluconeogenesis. Since fbp1 is involved in gluconeogenesis, it is likely that its expression or activity would be affected by glucose starvation stress. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
