    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease that is involved in the degradation of proteins in the lysosomes. Endosomes are membrane-bound compartments that are involved in the sorting and trafficking of proteins. Cathepsin L is known to be active in the lysosomes, which are derived from endosomes. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that cathepsin L is active in endosomes as well.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
