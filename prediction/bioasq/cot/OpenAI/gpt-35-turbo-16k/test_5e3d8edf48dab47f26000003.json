    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autophagy is a cellular process in which cells recycle their own components to obtain nutrients. It is a mechanism used by cells to maintain homeostasis and survive under conditions of nutrient deprivation. However, autophagy is not a process by which a virus obtains nutrients from its host. Viruses have different mechanisms to obtain nutrients from their host cells, such as hijacking cellular machinery or manipulating host cell metabolism. Therefore, the answer is no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
