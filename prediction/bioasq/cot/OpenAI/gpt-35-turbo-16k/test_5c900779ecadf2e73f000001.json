    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antisense therapy is a type of treatment that uses short DNA or RNA molecules to target and bind to specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules in the body. By binding to the mRNA, antisense molecules can prevent the production of specific proteins. Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene. The mutation leads to the production of a toxic protein called mutant huntingtin. Antisense therapy has been studied as a potential treatment for Huntington's disease, with the goal of reducing the production of mutant huntingtin protein. Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of antisense therapy in Huntington's disease. Based on this information, the answer to the question is:\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
