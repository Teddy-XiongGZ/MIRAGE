    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if natalizumab improves the disease course of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, we need to review the available evidence. Natalizumab is a medication that is used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, including relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, its effectiveness in treating secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is less clear. To answer this question, we need to look at clinical trials and studies that specifically evaluated the use of natalizumab in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Based on the available evidence, we can then determine if natalizumab improves the disease course of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
