    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The SNOT-22 is a validated questionnaire that assesses the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) on a patient's quality of life. It consists of 22 items that cover various symptoms and functional limitations associated with CRS. To determine if it is a widely used measure for HRQOL associated with CRS, we can consider the following factors: 1) the availability and use of the questionnaire in clinical practice and research studies, 2) the number of citations and references to the SNOT-22 in scientific literature, and 3) the recognition and endorsement of the SNOT-22 by professional organizations and guidelines. By considering these factors, we can determine if the SNOT-22 is widely used or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
