    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"g-H2AX is a phosphorylated form of the histone variant H2AX. It is known to be a marker for DNA double strand breaks. When double strand breaks occur, H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated at the site of the break, forming g-H2AX. This phosphorylation event helps recruit repair proteins to the site of the break. Therefore, g-H2AX is indeed a marker for double strand breaks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
