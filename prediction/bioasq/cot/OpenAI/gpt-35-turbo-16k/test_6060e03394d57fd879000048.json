    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if synonymous sites in primates and rodents are functionally constrained, we need to consider the genetic code and evolutionary conservation. Synonymous sites are positions in the DNA sequence where a mutation does not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein. If synonymous sites are functionally constrained, it means that mutations at these sites are not tolerated and may have negative effects on protein function. To answer this question, we can look at comparative genomics studies that compare the conservation of synonymous sites between primates and rodents. If there is a high level of conservation, it suggests that these sites are functionally constrained. If there is little conservation, it suggests that these sites are not functionally constrained. Therefore, we need to review the relevant scientific literature to determine the level of conservation at synonymous sites in primates and rodents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
