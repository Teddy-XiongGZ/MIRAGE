    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if PRL3-zumab can inhibit PRL3+ cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, we need to consider the following steps:\\n\\n1. Check if PRL3-zumab has been previously tested for its inhibitory effects on PRL3+ cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.\\n2. If yes, review the results of those studies to determine if PRL3-zumab showed inhibitory effects.\\n3. If no previous studies are available, consider the mechanism of action of PRL3-zumab and its potential to target PRL3+ cancer cells.\\n4. Review any available preclinical or clinical data on the use of PRL3-zumab in cancer models.\\n\\nBased on the information available, we can then determine the answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
