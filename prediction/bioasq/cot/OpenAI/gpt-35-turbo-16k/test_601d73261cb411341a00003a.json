    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, there is a genetic cause of craniostenosis. Craniostenosis is a condition characterized by the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, which leads to abnormal skull growth. This abnormal fusion can be caused by genetic mutations or abnormalities that affect the development of the skull bones. Several genes have been identified to be associated with craniostenosis, including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1, and MSX2. Mutations in these genes can disrupt the normal growth and development of the skull bones, leading to craniostenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
