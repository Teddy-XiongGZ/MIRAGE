    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells and CD4+ Helper T cells are not generated in the thyroid. They are generated in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells. These cells then migrate to the thymus where they undergo maturation and selection. During this process, CD8+ T cells acquire the CD8 co-receptor and CD4+ T cells acquire the CD4 co-receptor. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells express the T-cell receptor (TCR) on their surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
