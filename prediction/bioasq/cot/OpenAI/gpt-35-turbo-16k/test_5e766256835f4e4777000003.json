    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the rotavirus vaccines have changed the predominant rotavirus genotypes, we need to consider the impact of the vaccines on the circulating rotavirus strains. The rotavirus vaccines are designed to target specific rotavirus genotypes, so if the vaccines are effective, they should reduce the prevalence of the targeted genotypes. To answer the question, we need to review the available evidence on the impact of rotavirus vaccines on rotavirus genotypes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
