    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. Adenosine is a signaling molecule that plays a role in various physiological processes, including immune response and inflammation. 2. Adenosine signaling has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. 3. Adenosine can promote tumor growth by suppressing the immune system and promoting angiogenesis. 4. Adenosine signaling can also contribute to drug resistance in cancer cells. 5. Several studies have shown that high levels of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment are associated with poor prognosis in various types of cancer. 6. Therefore, based on the available evidence, adenosine signaling is prognostic for cancer outcome. 7. The answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
