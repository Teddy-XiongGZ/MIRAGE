    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The chromatin remodeling complex, RSC, is known to play a role in altering the structure of chromatin. H2A.Z is a variant of the histone protein H2A, which is a component of nucleosomes. To determine if RSC targets H2A.Z nucleosomes, we need to consider if there is any evidence or studies that have investigated the interaction between RSC and H2A.Z. If there is evidence of such interaction, then the answer would be 'yes'. If there is no evidence or studies suggesting an interaction between RSC and H2A.Z, then the answer would be 'no'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
