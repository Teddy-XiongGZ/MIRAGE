    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MAIT cells, or mucosal-associated invariant T cells, are a subset of T cells that have been primarily associated with immune responses in mucosal tissues. Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. To determine if MAIT cells have a role in multiple myeloma, we need to consider the available research and evidence. It is known that the tumor microenvironment in multiple myeloma can influence the immune response. Studies have shown that MAIT cells can be found in the bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma, and their frequency and function can be altered in this disease. Additionally, MAIT cells have been shown to have cytotoxic activity against myeloma cells in vitro. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that MAIT cells do have a role in multiple myeloma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
