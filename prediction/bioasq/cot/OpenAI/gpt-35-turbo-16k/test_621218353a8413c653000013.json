    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if REGN5458 is a single-targeted antibody, we need to gather information about its mechanism of action. REGN5458 is a monoclonal antibody developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. It is designed to target the protein BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), which is expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. If REGN5458 only targets BCMA and does not have any additional targets, then it can be considered a single-targeted antibody. To confirm this, we need to review the available literature or product information about REGN5458.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
