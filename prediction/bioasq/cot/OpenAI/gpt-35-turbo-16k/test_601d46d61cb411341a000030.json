    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants cause Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1), we need to review the available literature and evidence. Kabuki syndrome is primarily caused by pathogenic variants in the KMT2D gene. Missense variants are a type of genetic variant where a single nucleotide change results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. Exons 38 and 39 are specific regions of the KMT2D gene. To find the answer, we need to check if there is any evidence or studies that have specifically linked missense variants in exon 38 or 39 of the KMT2D gene to Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
