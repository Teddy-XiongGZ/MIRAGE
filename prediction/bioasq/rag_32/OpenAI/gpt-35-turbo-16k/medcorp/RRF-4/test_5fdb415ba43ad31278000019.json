    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, Nanog is not repressed in pluripotent stem cells. Document [0] states that Nanog is an ESC-specific factor and its repression correlates with the loss of pluripotency and ESC differentiation. Document [1] mentions that Nanog levels in pluripotent stem cells are heterogeneous and reflect different cell states, with a Nanog-high subpopulation poised for self-renewal and a Nanog-low subpopulation poised for differentiation. Document [2] describes a dose-dependent induction of Fgfbp1 and Fgfr2 by NANOG in Nanog-high cells, which triggers autorepression. Document [22] also mentions that Nanog autorepression is a major regulator of Nanog transcription switching. Based on this information, it can be concluded that Nanog is not repressed in pluripotent stem cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
