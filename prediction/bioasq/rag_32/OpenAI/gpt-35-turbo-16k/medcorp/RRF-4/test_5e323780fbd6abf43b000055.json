    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, there is evidence to suggest that there is an increased risk of meningiomas in atomic bomb survivors. Document [0] states that there is a high incidence of meningioma among Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors, with a significant correlation between the incidence and the dose of radiation to the brain. Document [1] also supports this finding, reporting a high correlation between incidence of meningiomas and distance from the hypocenter among Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Additionally, Document [4] mentions that atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima had a higher than typical frequency of developing meningiomas, with the incidence increasing the closer they were to the site of the explosion. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
