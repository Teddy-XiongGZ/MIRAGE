    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, yeast prions have indeed become important models for the study of the basic mechanisms underlying human amyloid diseases. Document [1] mentions that yeast models of amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases have become powerful tools for screening for compounds and drugs that reduce aggregation and toxicity of amyloids. Document [3] also states that the lessons learned from yeast prions may help in understanding human diseases. Additionally, document [7] mentions that yeast prions are important models for human amyloid diseases in general. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
