    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], an analysis of 4,227 genes subject to monoallelic expression (MAE) in humans uncovered high genetic variation across human populations. This increased diversity is associated with greater allelic age and elevated nucleotide diversity of MAE genes. Therefore, genes with monoallelic expression do contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
