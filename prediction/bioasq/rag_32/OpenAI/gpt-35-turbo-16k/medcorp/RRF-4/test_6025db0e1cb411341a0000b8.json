    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if capmatinib is effective for glioblastoma, we need to examine the relevant documents for information on capmatinib's efficacy in treating glioblastoma. Document [1] mentions that bevacizumab, not capmatinib, is recommended for the treatment of progressive glioblastoma. Document [3] describes a Phase Ib/II study of capmatinib in patients with recurrent glioblastoma, but the study did not show clear activity with capmatinib monotherapy. Document [5] states that bevacizumab alone is able to increase response rate and progression-free survival in recurrent glioblastoma. Based on this information, it can be concluded that capmatinib is not effective for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
