    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is clear that IFN-gamma (IFNg) can induce the expression of IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase). Document [0] states that IFN-gamma induces the enzyme IDO in a variety of human cell types. Document [4] also mentions that IDO expression is up-regulated by IFN-gamma in various cell types. Therefore, the answer is A. yes, IFNg can induce the expression of IDO.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
