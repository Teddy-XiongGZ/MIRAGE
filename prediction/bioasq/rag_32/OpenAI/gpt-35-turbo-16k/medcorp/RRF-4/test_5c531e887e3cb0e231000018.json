    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, ultraconserved enhancers are indeed important for normal development. Document [0] states that ultraconserved enhancers are required for normal development and that their loss can lead to neurological or growth abnormalities. Document [2] supports this by showing that ultraconserved enhancers still function as enhancers even with mutations, indicating their robustness and importance. Document [3] also suggests that ultraconservation identifies a small subset of highly constrained cis-regulatory elements that are functionally important. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
