    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, there is a role for HUWE1 in MYC signalling. Document [0] mentions that HUWE1 is involved in modulating c-MYC, an oncogene frequently dysregulated in multiple myeloma (MM). It shows that genetic knockdown and biochemical inhibition of HUWE1 reduced MYC expression in MM cell lines. Document [1] also supports this, stating that HUWE1 overexpression inhibits CaP proliferation and migration by downregulating c-Myc expression. Additionally, Document [4] mentions that inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 stabilizes MIZ1 and leads to the selective repression of MYC-activated target genes. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
