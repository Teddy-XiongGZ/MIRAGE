    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information from the relevant documents, FTO has been shown to be associated with pancreatic cancer progression and development. Document [0] states that FTO expression is associated with a poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients and that suppression of FTO expression inhibits cell proliferation. Document [2] also mentions that FTO promotes the growth, migration, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, Document [12] indicates that FTO suppresses pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis by demethylating PJA2 and inhibiting Wnt signaling. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the answer is A. yes, FTO can promote pancreatic cancer development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
