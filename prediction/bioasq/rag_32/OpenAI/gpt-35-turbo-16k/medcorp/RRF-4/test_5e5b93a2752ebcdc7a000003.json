    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, Flotillin can be used as an exosomal marker. Document [0] states that Stomatin, which belongs to the same family of lipid rafts proteins as Flotillin, is highly expressed in exosomes and is considered a promising exosomal marker. Document [1] also mentions that Flotillin release, a marker of exosomes, was attenuated by A\u03b2, indicating its association with exosomes. Additionally, Document [4] confirms the presence of Flotillin-1 in exosomes derived from synovial tissue. Therefore, based on the evidence from these documents, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
