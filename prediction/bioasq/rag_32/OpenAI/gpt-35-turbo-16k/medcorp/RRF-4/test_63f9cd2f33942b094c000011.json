    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators does have implications in central nervous system diseases. Document [0] mentions that aberrations in the inclusion of microexons have been observed to lead to abnormal processes in the central nervous system (CNS). Document [1] further supports this by showing that microglia deficient for the QUAKING (QKI) RNA binding protein, which regulates microexon networks of the Rho GTPase pathway, have increased proinflammatory cytokine release and defects in processing phagocytosed cargo. Document [3] also highlights the importance of microexons in nervous system development and their misregulation in autism. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
