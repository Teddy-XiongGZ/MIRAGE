    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) have a prognostic role in gliomas. Document [0] mentions that immune infiltrates composed of various lymphocyte subsets and microglia/macrophages are frequently observed in brain tumours, and their density and prognostic role seem to differ between tumour types. Document [4] states that TAMs, specifically M2-like TAMs, predict poor prognosis in high-grade gliomas and correlate with an aggressive tumour subtype. Document [7] also supports this, stating that M2 ratios are associated with tumour proliferation and poor prognosis. Additionally, document [25] mentions that CD204+ M2-polarized TAMs are negatively correlated with patient prognosis in low-grade glioma. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
