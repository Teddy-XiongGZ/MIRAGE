    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, circular RNAs are indeed implicated in diseases of the eye. Document [0] mentions that circular RNAs play a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation in eye pathologies such as neovascularization, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, ocular malignancy, and strabismus. Document [1] also highlights the potential roles of circular RNAs as biomarkers and mediators of retinal disease pathogenesis in diseases like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. Additionally, Document [3] states that dysregulated circRNAs are found in ocular diseases including pterygium, age-related cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinoblastoma, retinal vascular dysfunction, and hyperhomocysteinemia-induced ocular diseases, and they could be promising biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
