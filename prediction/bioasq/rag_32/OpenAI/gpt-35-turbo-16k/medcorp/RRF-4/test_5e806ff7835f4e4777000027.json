    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, ACE2 is expressed on cell surfaces. Document [0] states that the viral Spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the host cell-surface receptor ACE2. Document [1] also mentions that the virus gains access to host cells when the S-protein binds to the host cell surface receptor ACE2. Additionally, Document [2] describes ACE2 as a membrane protein located on the surface of intestinal enterocytes, renal tubular cells, and other cells. These statements indicate that ACE2 is indeed expressed on cell surfaces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
