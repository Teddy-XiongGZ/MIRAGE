    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CircRNA can be produced by back splicing of both exons and introns, forming both exon circRNA and intron circRNA. This is supported by multiple documents that mention the production of circRNAs from exons, introns, or both exons and introns. Specifically, Document [0] mentions that most circRNAs reported to date originate from back splicing of a pre-mRNA, which includes exonic circRNAs. Document [1] also mentions that circRNAs can originate from the interior regions of exons, introns, and intergenic transcripts, indicating the presence of both exon and intron circRNAs. Additionally, Document [3] states that non-canonical circRNAs can originate from intronic sequences, lariat-derived intronic circRNAs, and intron circles, further supporting the production of intron circRNAs. Therefore, the answer is yes, CircRNA can be produced by back splicing of exon, intron, or both, forming exon or intron circRNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
