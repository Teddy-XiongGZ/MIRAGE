    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, miR-122 has been shown to directly target RUNX2 in multiple studies. Document [0] states that miR-122 functions as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting RUNX2 in glioma cells. Document [2] also confirms that miR-122 directly attenuates Runx2 protein accumulation in osteoblasts. Additionally, Document [3] demonstrates that miR-122 and miR-203 reduce the abundance of Runx2 in breast cancer cells. Therefore, the answer is A. yes, miR-122 can target RUNX2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
