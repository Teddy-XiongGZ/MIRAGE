    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, honey does contain diastase/amylase. Document [0] mentions that diastase activity is a composition criterion for honeys intended for human consumption. Document [1] states that natural beehoney contains amylase (diastase) activity. Document [2] characterizes honey amylase and provides information about its stability and kinetics. Document [4] discusses the quality parameter of diastase/amylase activity in honey. Document [11] shows a correlation between the content of a lipid marker in honey and the enzymatic activity of invertase and diastase. Document [15] mentions the determination of diastase activity in honey. Document [17] provides information about diastase as an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of starch into maltose. Document [20] describes a rapid method for the determination of honey diastase activity. Document [21] presents a method for the determination of honey diastase activity using a polyacrylic film. Document [22] identifies proteolytic activities in honey, including serine proteases that can degrade major honey proteins. Document [24] describes a direct potentiometric determination of diastase activity in honey. Document [25] discusses the localization of alpha-glucosidases, including diastase, in honeybees and honey. Document [26] analyzes the effect of heating on diastase activity in honey. Document [29] mentions diastase activity as one of the parameters used to differentiate honey produced by kelulut bees. Document [30] evaluates diastase activity in Nigerian honey samples. Document [31] includes diastase activity as one of the investigated parameters in honey correlation study. Based on this information, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
