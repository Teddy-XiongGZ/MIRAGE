    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The comet assay is a method used to measure DNA damage in individual cells after exposure to radiation. It detects DNA strand breaks, which are a type of DNA damage. However, the comet assay does not directly measure mutations. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, whereas the comet assay measures the extent of DNA damage. Therefore, the answer is no, a comet assay does not measure radiation induced mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
