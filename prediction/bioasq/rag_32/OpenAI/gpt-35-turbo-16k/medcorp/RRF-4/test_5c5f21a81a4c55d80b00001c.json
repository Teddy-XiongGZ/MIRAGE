    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine whether selenocysteine is an amino acid. Document [2] states that selenocysteine is the 21st proteinogenic amino acid and is present in several enzymes. Document [10] also mentions that a selenocysteine-containing selenoprotein must be degraded prior to synthesizing a new selenocysteine for incorporation into a selenoprotein. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that selenocysteine is indeed an amino acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
