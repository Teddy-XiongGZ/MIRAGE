    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if erenumab is effective for trigeminal neuralgia, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] reports a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of erenumab in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. The trial found no difference between the erenumab and placebo groups in the number of responders at 4 weeks. Document [1] presents a retrospective case series showing that erenumab was an efficacious treatment option for patients with refractory trigeminal neuralgia. Based on these conflicting findings, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether erenumab is effective for trigeminal neuralgia. However, since the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial did not show a significant difference between erenumab and placebo, the most accurate answer choice would be B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
