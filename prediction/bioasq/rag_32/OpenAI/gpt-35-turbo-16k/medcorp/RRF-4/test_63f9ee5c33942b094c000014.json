    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, SRRM4 is indeed involved in the regulation of neuronal-specific microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA. Document [0] mentions that SRRM4 promotes the inclusion of microexon 34' into TAF1 mRNA, which encodes the largest subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIID. Document [1] also states that SRRM4 regulates the splicing of protrudin gene (Zfyve27) transcripts in neuronal cells. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
