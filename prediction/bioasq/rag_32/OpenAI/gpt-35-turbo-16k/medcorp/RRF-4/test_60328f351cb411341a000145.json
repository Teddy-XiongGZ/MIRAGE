    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA) has been shown to induce arthritis in various animal models, such as rats and mice. Document [0] states that injection of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (ICFA) alone specifically suppresses subsequent CFA-induced arthritis in DA rats. Document [2] mentions that successful induction of arthritis is reported to require the administration of CFA by intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Document [5] describes the use of FCA to induce arthritis in mice. Document [7] discusses the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis in the tibio-tarsal joint of rats using a low dose of Freund's adjuvant. Document [10] states that Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) is a potent adjuvant that can induce acute and chronic polyarthritis in rats. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA) can indeed induce arthritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
