    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine whether Phospholemman is a membrane protein. Document [3] states that Phospholemman is a homolog of the Na,K-ATPase gamma subunit and is a major cardiac myocyte phosphorylation target upon adrenergic stimulation. It is also shown to physically associate with the Na,K-ATPase in cerebellum and choroid plexus. Document [6] further supports this by stating that Phospholemman regulates the plasmalemmal sodium pump in excitable tissues. Additionally, Document [20] mentions that Phospholemman is a transmembrane protein found in cardiac sarcolemma. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that Phospholemman is indeed a membrane protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
