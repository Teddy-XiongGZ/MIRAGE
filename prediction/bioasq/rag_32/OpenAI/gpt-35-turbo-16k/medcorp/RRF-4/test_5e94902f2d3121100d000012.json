    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine whether aggrephagy is a variant of autophagy. Aggrephagy refers to the selective degradation of protein aggregates by macroautophagy. Document [1] specifically mentions that the selective degradation of protein aggregates by macroautophagy is called aggrephagy. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that aggrephagy is indeed a variant of autophagy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
