    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, mucins are glycosylated proteins. According to multiple documents, mucins are heavily glycosylated with O-linked glycans. The glycosylation of mucins is a key characteristic and plays important roles in their structure, function, and biological properties. The glycosylation of mucins involves the attachment of carbohydrate chains to the protein backbone through O-glycosidic linkages. This extensive glycosylation contributes to the large size and high molecular weight of mucins. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
