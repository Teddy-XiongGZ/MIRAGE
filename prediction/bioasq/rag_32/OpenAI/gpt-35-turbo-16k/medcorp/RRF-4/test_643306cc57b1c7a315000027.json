    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, CRISPR/Cas12a can be used for the detection of EGFR mutations in circulating DNA. Document [0] titled 'A CRISPR Test for Rapidly and Sensitively Detecting Circulating EGFR Mutations' provides evidence that the CRISPR-Cas12a system can detect EGFR mutations in circulating cell-free DNA with a limit of detection of 0.005%. The study demonstrates that the CRISPR-Cas12a system could rapidly and sensitively detect circulating EGFR mutations, indicating its potential for diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
