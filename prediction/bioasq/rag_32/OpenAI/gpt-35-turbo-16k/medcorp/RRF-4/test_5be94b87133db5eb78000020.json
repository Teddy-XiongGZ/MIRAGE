    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, gene therapy has shown promising results in restoring auditory function in animal models of hearing loss. Document [1] discusses the successful restoration of gene and protein expression, sensory cell function, auditory function, and hearing and balance behavior in a mouse model of Usher syndrome type 1c using gene therapy. Document [3] also reports the restoration of inner and outer hair cell function, cochlear and vestibular function, neural responses in auditory cortex, and behavioral responses to auditory and vestibular stimulation in mice with genetic inner ear disorders. Additionally, Document [14] demonstrates the restoration of auditory function and stable hearing thresholds for at least 12 weeks after gene therapy in adult mice. These findings suggest that gene therapy has the potential to restore auditory function. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
