    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], silencing of SRRM4 suppresses microexon inclusion and promotes tumor growth across cancers. It states that SRRM4 is the most consistently silenced splicing factor across all tumor types analyzed, implying a general advantage of microexon down-regulation in cancer. Additionally, Document [1] supports this finding by showing that SRRM4 drives neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma, which is associated with tumor growth. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
