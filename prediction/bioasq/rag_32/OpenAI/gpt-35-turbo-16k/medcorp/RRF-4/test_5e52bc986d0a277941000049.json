    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, the CADM2 gene is associated with differences in information processing speed. Document [0] states that the polymorphism rs17518584 near the CADM2 gene showed evidence of association with information processing speed as inferred from scores from various tests measuring processing speed. Document [1] also mentions that a significant association was observed between the SNP rs17518584 in the CADM2 gene and performance on the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST) and Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), which are tests of information processing speed. Therefore, based on the information from these documents, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
