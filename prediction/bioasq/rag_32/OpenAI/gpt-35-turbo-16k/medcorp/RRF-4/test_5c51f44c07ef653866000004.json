    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents and look for information about the relationship between CNVs and regions of low mappability. Document [0] mentions that low-mappability regions are approximately 5 times more likely to harbor germline CNVs. Document [1] discusses the limitations of CNV detection methods in regions of low mappability. Document [3] suggests that CNVs are enriched in sequences with high G+C content, which may be more prone to copy number variation. Based on this information, it can be inferred that CNVs are not depleted in regions of low mappability, but rather enriched. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
