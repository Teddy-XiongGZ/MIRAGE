    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"LOQ and LOD are not the same. LOD stands for Limit of Detection, which is the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be reliably detected. LOQ stands for Limit of Quantification, which is the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be reliably quantified with a high degree of confidence. While LOD is the point at which analysis is just feasible, LOQ is the concentration at which quantitative results can be reported with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
