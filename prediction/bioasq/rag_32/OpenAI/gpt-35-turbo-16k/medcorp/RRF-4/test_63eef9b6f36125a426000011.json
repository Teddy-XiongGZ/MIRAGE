    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prasinezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds aggregated alpha-synuclein, a key protein associated with Parkinson's disease. Document [0] states that the objective of the PASADENA study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prasinezumab in individuals with early PD. Document [2] mentions a phase 2 trial that randomly assigned participants with early-stage Parkinson's disease to receive intravenous placebo or prasinezumab at different doses. The results of this trial, as mentioned in Document [2], showed that prasinezumab therapy had no meaningful effect on global or imaging measures of Parkinson's disease progression compared to placebo.
