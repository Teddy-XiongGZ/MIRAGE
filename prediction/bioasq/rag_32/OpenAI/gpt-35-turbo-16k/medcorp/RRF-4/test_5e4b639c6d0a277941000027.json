    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the efficacy of the NicVAX vaccine for smoking cessation is not supported. Document [0] states that the NicVAX vaccine does not appear to improve the chances of stopping smoking when given in addition to varenicline and behavioral support. Document [1] mentions that none of the four included studies detected a statistically significant difference in long-term cessation between participants receiving the vaccine and those receiving placebo.
