    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if thiotepa can be recommended for the treatment of osteosarcoma, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] describes a study where high dose thiotepa was used in combination with autologous stem cell transplantation in children with relapsed osteosarcoma. The study reported partial and complete responses, as well as overall and progression-free survival rates. Document [1] also mentions the use of high-dose thiotepa with autologous bone marrow rescue in pediatric solid tumors, including osteosarcoma, with a response rate of 71%. However, Document [4] reports that adjuvant high-dose thiotepa did not significantly improve overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with resectable relapsed osteosarcoma. Based on these conflicting results, it is difficult to definitively recommend thiotepa for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
