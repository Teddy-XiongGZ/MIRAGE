    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, there is evidence suggesting a connection between autism and the Arginine Vasopressin Peptide (AVP). Several studies have shown that AVP and its receptors, particularly AVPR1a and AVPR1b, play a role in regulating social behavior, which is impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Genetic variations in the AVP system, including AVPR1a and AVPR1b polymorphisms, have been associated with ASD. Additionally, studies have found altered AVP levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with ASD. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
