    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, there is evidence to suggest that induction of interferon by TLR7 is higher in females, not males. Document [6] states that TLR7-driven type I interferon production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is higher in women than in men due to the cell-intrinsic actions of estrogen and X-chromosome complement. Document [12] also mentions that females have higher mRNA expression of all 13 IFN-\u03b1 subtypes in pDCs compared to males. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
