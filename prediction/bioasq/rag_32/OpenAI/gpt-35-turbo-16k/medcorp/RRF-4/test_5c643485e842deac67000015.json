    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], de novo mutations in highly evolutionarily conserved fetal brain-active elements are significantly and specifically enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders. The study identified a significant twofold enrichment of recurrently mutated elements and estimated that 1-3% of patients without a diagnostic coding variant carry pathogenic de novo mutations in fetal brain-active regulatory elements. Therefore, based on this information, de novo mutations in regulatory elements are responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
