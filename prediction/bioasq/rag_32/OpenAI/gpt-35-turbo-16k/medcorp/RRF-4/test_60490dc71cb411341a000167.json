    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Interferons are proteins that are released by host cells in response to the presence of viruses. They activate a signal transduction cascade leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. Interferons play a key role in host defenses against viral infections and are considered part of the innate immune response. Therefore, interferons can be considered defensive proteins. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
