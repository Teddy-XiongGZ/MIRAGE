    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, the safety and efficacy of multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) for the treatment of stroke have been investigated in clinical trials. Document [0] describes a phase 2 trial of intravenous MAPCs in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The study found that the administration of MAPCs was safe and well-tolerated in patients, but there was no significant improvement in neurological outcomes at 90 days compared to the placebo group. Document [7] also conducted a meta-analysis of 11 studies on autologous adult stem cell therapy for stroke and found no clinical significance in patients transplanted with stem cells compared to the control population. Although some preclinical studies have shown promising results, the current evidence from clinical trials does not support the effectiveness of MAPCs for the treatment of stroke. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
