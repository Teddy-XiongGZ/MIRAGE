    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can gather the following information: Document [0] mentions the existence of functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional, and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts. Document [1] states that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized into topologically associated domains (TADs). Document [2] discusses the principles of genome folding into TADs and highlights the specific characteristics of TADs in terms of size, structure, and proteins involved in their formation. Document [3] mentions the handcuff model and the loop extrusion model, which describe TAD formation with the aid of CTCF and cohesin proteins. Document [8] discusses how the cohesin and condensin complexes are key molecular machines that organize the 3D genome structure in yeast. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome is indeed organized into topologically associated domains (TADs).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
