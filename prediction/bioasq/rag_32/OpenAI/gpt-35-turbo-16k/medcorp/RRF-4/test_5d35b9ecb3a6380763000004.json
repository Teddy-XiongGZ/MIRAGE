    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is clear that cohesin plays a role in gene expression. Several studies have shown that cohesin regulates gene transcription and is involved in the control of gene expression during development. Mutations or deletion of cohesin subunits have been shown to alter gene expression patterns. Therefore, the answer to the question is A. yes, deletion of cohesin can change gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
