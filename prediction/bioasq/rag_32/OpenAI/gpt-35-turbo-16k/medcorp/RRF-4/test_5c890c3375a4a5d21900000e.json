    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, oleuropein aglycone has been shown to interfere with amyloid aggregation in multiple studies. Document [0] states that oleuropein aglycone interferes with the aggregation of amylin and A\u03b2(1-42), eliminating their cytotoxicity. Document [1] also mentions that oleuropein aglycone interferes with amyloid aggregation of various proteins/peptides involved in amyloid diseases. Document [2] further supports this by stating that oleuropein aglycone prevents the growth of toxic A\u03b2(1-42) oligomers and blocks their successive growth into mature fibrils. Additionally, Document [3] mentions that oleuropein aglycone stabilizes \u03b1-synuclein monomers and favors the growth of non-toxic aggregates. Based on this information, it can be concluded that oleuropein aglycone can indeed interfere with amyloid aggregation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
