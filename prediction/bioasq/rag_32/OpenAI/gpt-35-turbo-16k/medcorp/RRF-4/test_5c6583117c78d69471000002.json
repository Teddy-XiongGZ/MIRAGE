    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, midostaurin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis. Document [0] mentions that midostaurin can inhibit growth and induce megakaryocytic differentiation in human leukemia cells, which involves the expression and signaling of c-Mpl, a thrombopoietin receptor-encoding gene. Document [7] states that angiogenesis is a fundamental process in which neovascularization is tightly regulated, and that synthetic inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as midostaurin, are being evaluated in clinical trials against a variety of solid tumors. Document [14] also mentions that midostaurin inhibits immunoglobulin E-dependent activation and mediator release in human blood basophils and mast cells, which are involved in angiogenesis. Therefore, based on this information, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
