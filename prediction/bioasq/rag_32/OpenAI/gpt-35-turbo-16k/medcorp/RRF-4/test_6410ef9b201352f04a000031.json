    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, modulation of KCNQ1 splicing has been suggested as a potential strategy to prevent arrhythmias. Document [0] mentions that the modulation of KCNQ1 splicing may help prevent arrhythmia. Additionally, Document [5] discusses the identification of KCNQ1 splicing mutations in patients with long QT syndrome, suggesting that the clinical severity may differ according to the aberrant splicing products. Therefore, based on the available information, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
