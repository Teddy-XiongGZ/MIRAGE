    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA have been shown to regulate gene expression by influencing mRNA stability, translational efficiency, and localization. They contain regulatory sequences that can post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. These regulatory sequences include microRNA response elements (MREs) and binding sites for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the UTRs, microRNAs can decrease gene expression by inhibiting translation or causing degradation of the mRNA. Additionally, the length and structural characteristics of UTRs contribute to translation regulation. Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer is A. yes, untranslated regions (UTRs) can regulate gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
