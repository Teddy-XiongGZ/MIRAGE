    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, resistance training is commonly associated with increasing muscle hypertrophy. Document [0] states that there is strong evidence that resistance training frequency does not significantly or meaningfully impact muscle hypertrophy when volume is equated. Document [1] suggests that increasing the training frequency may allow for more frequent elevations in muscle protein synthesis and more time spent in a positive net protein balance, leading to muscle growth. Document [4] discusses the quest to increase lean body mass through resistance training and the various factors that mediate the hypertrophic process. Document [5] mentions that strength training, which is a form of resistance training, can induce muscular hypertrophy. Document [10] states that a positive energy balance and progressive overload, which are common principles in resistance training, are required for muscle hypertrophy. Overall, the majority of the provided documents support the idea that resistance training is associated with increasing muscle hypertrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
