    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the H3 R antagonist CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition in clinical trials, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] states that CEP-26401 has potential therapeutic utility in cognition enhancement, and Document [2] mentions that CEP-26401 has cognition-enhancing and wake-promoting activities. However, Document [1] states that the effect of CEP-26401 on spatial working memory was subtle and only seen at the lowest dose tested. Document [3] mentions GSK239512, another H3 R antagonist, and its positive effects on attention and memory. Based on this information, it is unclear if CEP-26401 specifically has a positive effect on cognition in clinical trials. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
