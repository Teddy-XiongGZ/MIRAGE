    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if pembrolizumab is effective against Ewing's sarcoma, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that one patient with Ewing sarcoma had a sustained complete response to pembrolizumab therapy. Document [2] also mentions a case of relapsed Ewing sarcoma that had a very good response to a combination of paclitaxel and nivolumab, which is another immune checkpoint inhibitor similar to pembrolizumab. However, Document [3] mentions that a nonrandomized clinical trial combining doxorubicin with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced, anthracycline-naive sarcomas did not reach the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR). Based on this information, it can be concluded that pembrolizumab has shown some effectiveness in treating Ewing's sarcoma, but further studies are needed to fully evaluate its efficacy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
