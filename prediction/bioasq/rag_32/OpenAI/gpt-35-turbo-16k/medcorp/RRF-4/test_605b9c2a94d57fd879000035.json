    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, amblyopia does affect the eye. Amblyopia is a disorder of sight in which the brain fails to fully process inputs from one eye and over time favors the other eye. It results in decreased vision in an eye that typically appears normal in other respects. Amblyopia is the most common cause of decreased vision in a single eye among children and younger adults. The condition is characterized by several functional abnormalities in spatial vision, including reductions in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity function, and vernier acuity, as well as spatial distortion, abnormal spatial interactions, and impaired contour detection. Amblyopia also affects binocular vision, leading to limited stereoscopic depth perception and difficulty seeing three-dimensional images. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
