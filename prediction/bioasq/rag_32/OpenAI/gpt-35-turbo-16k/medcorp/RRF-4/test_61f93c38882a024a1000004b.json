    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence suggesting that Isradipine may have the potential to slow the progression of Early Parkinson Disease. Document [0] mentions that Isradipine has been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Document [2] re-analyzed the data from a clinical trial and found that participants given 10 mg/day of Isradipine had significantly smaller total and part 3 UPDRS scores at the end of the trial compared to the placebo group. Document [7] also mentions that drugs with selectivity for Cav1.3 calcium channels, such as Isradipine, are neuroprotective in animal models of Parkinson's disease. However, it is important to note that the phase III clinical trial mentioned in Document [23] failed to show efficacy in slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease. Overall, while there is some evidence suggesting the potential for Isradipine to slow the progression of Early Parkinson Disease, further research and clinical trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
