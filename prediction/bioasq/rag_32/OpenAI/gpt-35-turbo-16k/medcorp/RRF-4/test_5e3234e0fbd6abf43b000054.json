    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the answer is yes. Document [0] states that Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for radiation-induced meningiomas. Document [1] also mentions that stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become an important primary or adjuvant management for patients with intracranial meningiomas, including radiation-induced tumors. Document [14] further supports this by reporting that Gamma Knife radiosurgery provides high rates of tumor control for radiation-induced intracranial tumors, including meningiomas. Therefore, the evidence suggests that radiation-induced meningiomas can be treated with radiosurgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
