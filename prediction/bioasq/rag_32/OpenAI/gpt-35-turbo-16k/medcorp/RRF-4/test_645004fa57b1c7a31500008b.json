    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if accessible enhancers are necessarily active, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [2] discusses the relationship between accessibility and activity of enhancers. It states that while open chromatin is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers do display a higher degree of accessibility compared to other states. This suggests that accessible enhancers are more likely to be active, but it does not necessarily mean that all accessible enhancers are active. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
