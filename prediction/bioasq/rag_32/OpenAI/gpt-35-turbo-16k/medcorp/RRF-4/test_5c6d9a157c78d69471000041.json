    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, MoRFs can be computationally predicted in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). There are several computational methods and predictors available for the prediction of MoRFs in IDPs. These methods utilize various features such as sequence properties, physicochemical properties, evolutionary information, and machine learning algorithms to identify and predict MoRF regions in protein sequences. Some of the commonly used predictors include OPAL+, MoRFpred, ANCHOR, MoRFCHiBi, and MoRF-FUNCpred. These predictors have been shown to achieve high accuracy in predicting MoRF regions in IDPs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
