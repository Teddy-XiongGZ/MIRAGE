    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, it is possible to analyze exosomes with FACS. FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) is a flow cytometry-based technique that can be used to analyze and sort individual exosomes based on specific cell-surface markers. This technique involves labeling exosomes with fluorescent antibodies or dyes that target specific proteins or markers on the exosome surface. The labeled exosomes can then be analyzed and sorted based on their fluorescence signals using a flow cytometer. FACS can provide information about the size, phenotype, and protein composition of exosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
