    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, Otolin-1 is indeed a matrix protein. Document [0] mentions that Otolin-1 is a collagenous protein involved in the correct arrangement of the otoliths onto the sensory epithelium of the inner ear and stabilization of the otolith matrix. Document [2] also identifies Otolin-1 as a major organic component of the otolith, serving as a template for calcification. Additionally, Document [4] states that Otolin-1 is a glycoprotein specific to the inner ear and is a component of the otoconial matrix. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
