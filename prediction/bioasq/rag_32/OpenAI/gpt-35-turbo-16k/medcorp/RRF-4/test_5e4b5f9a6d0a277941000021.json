Document [3] mentions that Pentoxifylline is one of the therapeutic options for ALS, along with other anti-inflammatory medications. Document [8] also mentions that Pentoxifylline is being investigated as a potential therapy for ALS. However, Document [5] states that Pentoxifylline is not a promising treatment for multiple sclerosis, which is a different condition.
