    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, dacomitinib has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of glioblastoma (GB). Document [0] mentions that dacomitinib has noteworthy antiglioma activity in preclinical models and has been tested in one phase II trial in patients with recurrent GB with EGFR amplification. However, the global results of dacomitinib in recurrent GB shown in the phase II trial were poor. Document [2] also states that dacomitinib has limited single-agent activity in recurrent GB with EGFR amplification. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is not recommended to use dacomitinib for the treatment of glioblastoma patients. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
