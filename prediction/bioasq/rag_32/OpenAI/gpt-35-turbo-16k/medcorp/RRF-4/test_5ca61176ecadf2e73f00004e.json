    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, TAD disruption can lead to disease. Several documents mention that disruption of TAD boundaries can affect the expression of nearby genes and cause disease. Document [1] states that disruption of TAD boundaries can cause developmental disorders and contribute to the growth of certain cancers. Document [2] mentions that boundary mutations can lead to human developmental disorders and oncogene overexpression in certain cancers. Document [9] provides evidence that disruption of TADs can rewire long-range regulatory architecture and result in pathogenic phenotypes. Document [14] discusses how disease-causing structural variations can disrupt TADs and lead to gene misexpression and disease. Overall, the evidence from these documents supports the idea that TAD disruption can lead to disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
