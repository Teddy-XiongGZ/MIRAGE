    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if EuroQol 5-Dimension Health Assessment (EQ-5D) is a 5 question assessment, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [3] states that the EQ-5D descriptive system is a preference-based HRQL measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. This indicates that EQ-5D consists of five questions, each corresponding to one dimension of health. Therefore, the answer is yes, EQ-5D is a 5 question assessment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
