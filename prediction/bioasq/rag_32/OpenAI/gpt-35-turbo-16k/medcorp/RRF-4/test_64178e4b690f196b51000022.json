    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if golodirsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that golodirsen is a medication used for the treatment of DMD and works by inducing exon skipping in the dystrophin gene, thereby increasing the amount of dystrophin protein available to muscle fibers. Document [1] reports the results of a clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of golodirsen in DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. The study found that golodirsen increased dystrophin protein expression and showed functional benefit compared to external controls. Document [3] also supports the effectiveness of golodirsen, stating that it induces exon skipping and increases dystrophin production in DMD patients. Based on this information, it can be concluded that golodirsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
