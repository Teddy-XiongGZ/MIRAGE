    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence that variants in FHF2 (also known as FGF13) are associated with encephalopathy. Document [0] mentions that gain of function hemizygous or heterozygous variants in FGF13 (FHF2) were identified as the cause for X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 90 (DEE90). Document [1] also states that missense variants in the N-terminal domain of FHF2/FGF13 cause an X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Additionally, Document [6] reports a gain-of-function FHF1 mutation causing early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
