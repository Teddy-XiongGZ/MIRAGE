    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is consistent evidence that radiation for tinea capitis increases the risk of brain tumors. Document [0] states that ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for brain tumors. Document [2] confirms that radiation for tinea capitis in childhood is associated with an increased risk of tumors of the brain and nervous system. Document [5] specifically mentions radiation-induced intracranial meningiomas in patients previously treated with low-dose radiation for tinea capitis. Document [10] provides further evidence by estimating the dose to various head structures in children treated with X-ray therapy for tinea capitis. Overall, the evidence supports the conclusion that radiation for tinea capitis increases brain tumor risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
