    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the efficacy of MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is inconclusive. Document [1] reports the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (MAGRIT) that investigated the efficacy of MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic in surgically resected MAGE-A3-positive NSCLC. The trial did not show any increase in disease-free survival compared to placebo. Document [2] also reports the results of a phase 2 randomized study that assessed the clinical activity of MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic in completely resected MAGE-A3-positive stage IB to II NSCLC. The study did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in disease-free interval, disease-free survival, or overall survival. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
