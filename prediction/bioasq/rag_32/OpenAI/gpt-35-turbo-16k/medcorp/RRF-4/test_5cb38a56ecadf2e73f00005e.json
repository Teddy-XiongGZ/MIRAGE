    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, MYC is not a tumor suppressor gene. MYC is described as an oncogene and is implicated in the pathogenesis of most types of human cancers. It is involved in the initiation and maintenance of tumorigenesis, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. MYC drives uncontrolled tumor growth, cellular proliferation, and altered cellular metabolism. It also influences tumor cell fate by enforcing self-renewal and abrogating cellular senescence and differentiation programs. Brief or partial suppression of MYC can lead to tumor regression. Therefore, MYC is not a tumor suppressor gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
