    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants cause Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1), we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] states that missense variants in exon 38 or 39 of KMT2D have been found in patients with a new phenotype distinct from KS1. Document [10] also mentions that missense variants in exon 38 or 39 of KMT2D cause a multiple malformations disorder distinct from KS1. Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer is B. no, exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants do not cause Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
