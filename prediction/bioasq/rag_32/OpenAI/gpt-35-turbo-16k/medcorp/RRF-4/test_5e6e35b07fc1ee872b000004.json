    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if astrocytes are part of the blood-brain barrier, we need to examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions confusion about the role of astrocytes in the development of the blood-brain barrier, but states that these issues should soon be clarified. Document [3] states that astrocytes control the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Document [4] mentions that astrocytes perform biochemical control of endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier. Document [8] states that specialized glial cells called astrocytes form a tight junction or protective barrier around brain blood vessels and may be important in the development of the blood-brain barrier. Document [9] mentions that astrocyte cell projections called astrocytic feet surround the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier, providing biochemical support to those cells. Document [11] mentions that astrocytes were thought to aid in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, but recent research indicates that they do not play a substantial role. Document [21] concludes that astrocytes are necessary to maintain blood-brain barrier integrity in the adult brain. Based on this information, it can be concluded that astrocytes are indeed part of the blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
