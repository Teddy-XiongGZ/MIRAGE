    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if radiosurgery can be used for DNET tumors, we need to examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions a case of a simple DNET with disease progression that showed a significant radiologic response following concurrent therapy with temozolomide and external beam radiation therapy. Document [3] also mentions a case of an 8-year-old boy with a DNET who underwent fractionated radiotherapy and eventually chemotherapy for tumor growth. Document [10] discusses the long-term outcome of gamma knife radiosurgery in the management of DNETs and reports that radiosurgery was effective in terms of tumor and seizure control. Based on this information, it can be concluded that radiosurgery can be used for DNET tumors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
