    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if promoter shape varies across populations, we need to find information about promoter shape in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that animal promoters can have either narrow or broad shapes, referred to as promoter shape. Document [2] also discusses the properties of mammalian promoters, including their breadth of expression across cell types. Document [8] provides a high-resolution map of promoters in Drosophila melanogaster and mentions that promoters can have different shapes. Based on this information, it is likely that promoter shape does vary across populations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
