    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if GRG5 is involved only in late embryonic mouse development, we need to examine the relevant documents for information about the expression and function of GRG5 during different stages of embryonic development. We can start by looking at Document [2] which specifically mentions the role of GRG5 in early developmental stages. If Document [2] provides evidence that GRG5 is involved in early embryonic development, then the answer would be 'no'. If Document [2] does not provide any information about the involvement of GRG5 in early embryonic development, then we would need to examine other documents for more information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
