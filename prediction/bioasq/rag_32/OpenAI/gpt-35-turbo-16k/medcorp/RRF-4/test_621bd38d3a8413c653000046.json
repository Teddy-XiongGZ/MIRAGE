    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with aberrant glycosylation. Document [1] states that glycomic profiling of serum from patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma revealed a subset of glycans that can be selected as candidate biomarkers. Document [2] also mentions that comparative glycomic profiling of esophageal adenocarcinoma reveals a subset of glycans that can be selected as candidate biomarkers. Additionally, Document [4] discusses the abnormal glycosylation signatures in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of esophageal cancer. Therefore, based on this information, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
