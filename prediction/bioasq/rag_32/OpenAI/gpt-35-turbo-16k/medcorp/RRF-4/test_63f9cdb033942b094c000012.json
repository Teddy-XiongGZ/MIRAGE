    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, silencing of SRRM4 suppresses microexon inclusion. Document [0] states that SRRM4 is the most consistently silenced splicing factor across all tumor types analyzed, resulting in the suppression of normal microexon inclusion. Document [2] also mentions that knockdown of SRRM4/nSR100, the neuronal-specific splicing factor, leads to the exclusion of microexon 34' from the neuronal form of TAF1 mRNA. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
