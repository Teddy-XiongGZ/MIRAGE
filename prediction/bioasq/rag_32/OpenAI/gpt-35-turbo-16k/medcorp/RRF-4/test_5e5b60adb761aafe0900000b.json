    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, ABCG2 is described as a membrane protein and a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. It is involved in xenobiotic and endobiotic transport in key pharmacological barriers and drug metabolizing organs. It is also implicated in multidrug resistance of cancer and protection of stem cells. The documents mention that ABCG2 has transmembrane domains and is localized on the plasma membrane. Therefore, based on this information, the protein ABCG2 is transmembrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
