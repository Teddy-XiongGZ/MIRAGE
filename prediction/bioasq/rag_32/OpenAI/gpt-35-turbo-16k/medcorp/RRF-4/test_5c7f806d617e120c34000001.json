    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, tumour-specific antigens can originate from various sources, including mutated oncogenes, genes specifically expressed in tumours, and altered cell surface glycolipids and glycoproteins. Therefore, it is possible that tumour-specific antigens can originate from known protein coding genes. However, it is important to note that not all tumour-specific antigens are derived from protein coding genes. Some tumour-specific antigens can also arise from non-canonical open reading frames, mutational frameshifts, splice variants, gene fusions, endogenous retroelements, and other processes. Therefore, the answer is not definitive and requires further investigation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
