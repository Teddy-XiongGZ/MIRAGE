    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, GRBs (genomic regulatory blocks) and TADs (topologically associating domains) are related concepts. Document [1] mentions that GRBs are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs) and that they often contain extensive gene deserts. Document [0] states that clusters of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) strongly coincide with topological organization, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of TADs. Document [13] also mentions that HCNE arrays often span unrelated neighboring genes and that the synteny blocks correspond to regulatory domains. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that GRBs and TADs are not different concepts, but rather refer to the same or closely related genomic structures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
