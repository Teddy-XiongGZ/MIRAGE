    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No, changes in coding regions of MEF2C do not exclusively cause developmental disorders. Document [1] mentions that non-coding region variants upstream of MEF2C can also cause severe developmental disorders through loss-of-function mechanisms. Additionally, Document [3] reports a patient with a balanced translocation that resulted in MEF2C overexpression and a phenotype similar to MEF2C functional duplication. Therefore, changes in non-coding regions and gene regulation can also contribute to MEF2C-related developmental disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
