    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is evident that gut microbiota profiles are indeed altered by irradiation. Multiple studies have shown that exposure to radiation leads to changes in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Document [0] mentions that irradiation results in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, while Document [2] states that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with the development and progression of radiation enteritis. Furthermore, Document [7] highlights that low-dose ionizing radiation has a significant impact on the composition and functional role of the gut microbiota. These findings indicate that gut microbiota profiles are indeed altered by irradiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
