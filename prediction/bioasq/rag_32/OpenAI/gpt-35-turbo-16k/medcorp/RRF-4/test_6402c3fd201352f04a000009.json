    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if prehospital transdermal glyceryl trinitrate was effective for stroke in the RIGHT-2 trial, we need to analyze the relevant documents. The RIGHT-2 trial was a randomized-controlled trial that assessed the safety and efficacy of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in adults with ultra-acute presumed stroke. Document [0] provides information about the RIGHT-2 trial and its findings. Document [5] also discusses the RIGHT-2 trial and its results. We need to review these documents to determine if prehospital transdermal glyceryl trinitrate was effective for stroke in the RIGHT-2 trial.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
