    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Viltolarsen is a medication used for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. Document [0] states that viltolarsen is indicated for the treatment of DMD in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. Document [1] mentions that viltolarsen has been shown to induce dystrophin expression and is safe and well tolerated in DMD patients. Document [2] explains that viltolarsen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) designed to skip exon 53 on the DMD primary transcript. Document [3] confirms that viltolarsen is used for the treatment of DMD in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. Document [4] states that viltolarsen is a drug of PMO chemistry designed to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene and restore muscle function. Document [5] mentions that the FDA concluded that viltolarsen demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in people with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 53 skipping. Document [6] reports that viltolarsen has been shown to increase endogenous dystrophin levels and improve motor function in DMD patients. Based on the information from these documents, it can be concluded that viltolarsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
