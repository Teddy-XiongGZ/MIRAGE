    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is stated in Document [0] that exosomes secreted by cortical neurons carry endogenous APP and its fragments. Document [1] also mentions that exosomes isolated from brain tissues contain full-length APP and APP C-terminal fragments. Additionally, Document [2] states that exosomes derived from AD mouse brain promote APP expression in neuronal cells. Therefore, based on these findings, it can be concluded that brain derived exosomes can carry APP molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
