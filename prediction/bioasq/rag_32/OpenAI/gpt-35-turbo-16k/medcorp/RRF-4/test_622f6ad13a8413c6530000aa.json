    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that parasite infections by Schistosoma japonicum can prevent or improve asthma. Document [0] states that helminth infections and their proteins can inhibit allergic asthma via immune regulation. Document [1] found that S. japonicum infection downregulated allergic airway inflammation in mice. Document [2] also showed that S. japonicum infection led to a significant decrease in eosinophil accumulation and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines in mice with allergen-induced airway inflammation. Document [5] found that S. mansoni infection, a related helminth, was associated with a reduced course of asthma in humans. Document [12] suggests that S. mansoni infection may protect against allergic diseases such as asthma. Document [13] demonstrated that a peptide derived from S. japonicum can suppress airway inflammation in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Overall, the evidence suggests that parasite infections by S. japonicum can prevent or improve asthma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
