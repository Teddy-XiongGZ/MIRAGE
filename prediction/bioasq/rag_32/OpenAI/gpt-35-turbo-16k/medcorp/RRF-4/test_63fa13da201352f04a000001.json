    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, PRP-40 regulation of microexons is described as a widely conserved phenomenon. Document [0] states that PRP-40 is a core component of the U1 snRNP and is required for inclusion of alternatively spliced microexons in C. elegans. Document [4] mentions that misregulation of microexons, including those regulated by PRP-40, is linked to autism. Document [10] further supports the conservation of PRP-40 regulation of microexons, stating that microexons are the most conserved class of alternative splicing events and that their regulation by the neuronal-specific splicing factor SRRM4/nSR100, which is related to PRP-40, is highly conserved in vertebrates. Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
