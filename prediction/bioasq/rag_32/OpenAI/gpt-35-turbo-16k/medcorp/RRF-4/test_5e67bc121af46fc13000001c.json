    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Spinal Intradural Primary Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are rare in neurofibromatosis patients, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] states that spinal intradural MPNSTs in children are extremely rare, with only five reported cases in the literature. Document [8] mentions that MPNSTs are rare in children and account for approximately 5-10% of all soft tissue sarcomas in adults. However, Document [10] states that MPNSTs are regarded as being sporadic or associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Based on these documents, it can be concluded that MPNSTs can occur in neurofibromatosis patients, but they are still considered rare. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
