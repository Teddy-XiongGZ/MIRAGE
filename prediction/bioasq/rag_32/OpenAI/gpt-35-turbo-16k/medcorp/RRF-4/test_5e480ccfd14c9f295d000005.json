    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, phosphorylation of histone H2AX at serine 139 (gamma-H2AX) is a sensitive marker for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The presence of gamma-H2AX foci indicates the formation of DSBs, and the number and intensity of these foci correlate with the number of DSBs. Therefore, g-H2AX can be considered as a marker for double-strand breaks. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
