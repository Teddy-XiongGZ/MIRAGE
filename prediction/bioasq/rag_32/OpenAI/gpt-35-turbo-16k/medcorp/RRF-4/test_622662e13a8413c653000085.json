    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Yes, METTL3 can methylate long noncoding RNAs. Document [1] mentions that METTL3 and METTL14 complex transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to N6 amino group of adenosine bases in RNA (m6A) and DNA (m6dA). Document [2] also states that METTL3 and METTL14 preferentially catalyze the formation of m6dA in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), despite weaker binding affinity to DNA. Both documents provide evidence that METTL3 is involved in the methylation of RNA and DNA, including long noncoding RNAs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
