    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if nintedanib improves response rate in patients with bladder cancer, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [1] is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial that investigated the effect of adding nintedanib to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response rate, and the results showed no significant improvement in pathological complete response rate with the addition of nintedanib. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
