    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information from the relevant documents, SOX10 is expressed in melanoma cells. Document [0] states that both SOX9 and SOX10 exhibit distinct but overlapping expression patterns with metastatic marker NEDD9 in melanoma patient samples. Document [1] mentions that SOX10 contributes to melanomagenesis by regulating the SOX10-MITF pathway. Document [2] shows that reducing SOX10 expression levels in human melanoma cells abolishes tumorigenesis. Document [3] states that SOX10 is a key regulator of melanoma progression. Document [4] demonstrates that SOX10 promotes melanoma cell invasion. Document [5] suggests that SOX10 is a specific marker for detecting metastases of melanoma in lymph nodes. Document [6] shows that SOX10 is strongly expressed in desmoplastic melanoma. Document [7] states that SOX10 is a pan-schwannian and melanocytic marker. Document [8] indicates that SOX10 is strongly expressed in malignant melanoma. Document [9] shows that SOX10 is required for melanoma tumor growth. Document [10] demonstrates that SOX10 controls migration of melanoma cells. Document [11] mentions that SOX10 is highly expressed in melanoma tumors. Document [12] shows that SOX10 is expressed in primary melanocytic neoplasms. Document [13] states that SOX10 is a sensitive and specific marker for melanoma. Document [14] indicates that SOX10 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for malignant melanoma. Document [15] shows that SOX10 is a reliable marker for detecting metastatic melanoma in sentinel lymph nodes. Document [16] demonstrates that SOX10 ablation suppresses melanomagenesis. Document [17] suggests that SOX10 regulates melanoma cell invasion. Document [18] states that SOX10 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for malignant melanoma. Document [19] shows that SOX10 is coexpressed with nestin in melanoma. Document [20] indicates that SOX10 knockdown inhibits melanoma cell proliferation. Document [21] suggests that SOX10 is expressed in granulomatous dermatoses and benign reactive lymph nodes. Document [22] demonstrates that SOX10 is expressed in primary melanocytic neoplasms. Document [23] shows that SOX10 is expressed in malignant melanoma, carcinoma, and normal tissues. Document [24] indicates that SOX10 expression is rare in non-small cell lung cancer. Document [25] suggests that SOX10 is coexpressed with SOX9 during melanocytic differentiation. Document [26] demonstrates that SOX10 is expressed in schwannian and melanocytic neoplasms. Document [27] shows that SOX10 is expressed in melanoma cells in effusions. Document [28] indicates that SOX10 is a marker of melanoma in effusion cytology. Document [29] suggests that SOX10 expression distinguishes desmoplastic melanoma from its histologic mimics. Document [30] demonstrates that SOX10 is regulated via ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Document [31] shows that SOX10 stability is regulated by Fbxw7\u03b1-mediated degradation. Based on the consistent evidence from these documents, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
