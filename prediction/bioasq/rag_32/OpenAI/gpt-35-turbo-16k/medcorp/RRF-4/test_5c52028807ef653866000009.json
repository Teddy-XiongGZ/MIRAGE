    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is stated that mitochondrial inheritance in humans is primarily maternal, meaning that mitochondria are inherited only from the mother. Document [0] explains that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not transmitted through nuclear DNA (nDNA) and is inherited only from the mother's ovum. Document [3] also confirms that when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA usually come from the egg only, and the sperm's mitochondria do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. While there have been rare cases reported of paternal mitochondrial inheritance in humans, these cases are very rare and require further investigation (Document [2]). Therefore, the answer is B. no, mitochondria cannot be inherited by both parents in humans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
