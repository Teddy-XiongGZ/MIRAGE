    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if CMB305 can be used against sarcomas, we need to examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] describes a phase II randomized study of CMB305 and atezolizumab compared with atezolizumab alone in soft-tissue sarcomas expressing NY-ESO-1. The study investigated the efficacy and safety of adding the CMB305 regimen to atezolizumab in patients with synovial sarcoma or myxoid liposarcoma. Document [1] also discusses the potential of the CMB305 vaccine regimen to target NY-ESO-1 and improve outcomes for synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma patients. Based on this information, it appears that CMB305 can be used against sarcomas, specifically synovial sarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma, which express NY-ESO-1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
