    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, Figitumumab has shown some potential as a treatment option for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Document [0] states that Figitumumab has been well tolerated in clinical studies and recent data suggest that it might be active in combination with platinum doublets for the treatment of chemotherapy-naive NSCLC. However, Document [3] mentions that a phase III study comparing Figitumumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC was closed early due to futility and increased incidence of serious adverse events. Considering these conflicting statements, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether Figitumumab is effective for NSCLC. Therefore, the answer is inconclusive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
