    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether nerinetide should be used for the treatment of ischaemic stroke, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] provides information about a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of nerinetide in human ischaemia-reperfusion in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The trial compared nerinetide to placebo and found that nerinetide did not improve the proportion of patients achieving good clinical outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy compared to placebo. Therefore, based on the evidence from this trial, the answer is no, nerinetide should not be used for the treatment of ischaemic stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
