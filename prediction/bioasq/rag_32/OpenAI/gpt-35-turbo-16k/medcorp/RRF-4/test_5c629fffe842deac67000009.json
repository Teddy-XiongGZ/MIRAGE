    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) has a role only in late development, we need to examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [5] states that GRG5 is involved in early developmental stages and stem cell fate decisions. Document [10] mentions that GRG1 overexpression induces lung adenocarcinoma, while GRG5 overexpression does not. Document [14] suggests that GRG5 is involved in left-right asymmetry and organogenesis. Based on this information, it can be concluded that GRG5 does not have a role only in late development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
