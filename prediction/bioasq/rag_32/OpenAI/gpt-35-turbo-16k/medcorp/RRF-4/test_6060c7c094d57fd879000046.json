    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cadherins are a group of transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. They are integral membrane proteins that form cell-cell junctions, including adherens junctions, desmosomes, and cardiac junctions. Cadherins are involved in cell-cell adhesion and are critical for maintaining tissue integrity and morphogenesis. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that cadherin is a plasma membrane marker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
