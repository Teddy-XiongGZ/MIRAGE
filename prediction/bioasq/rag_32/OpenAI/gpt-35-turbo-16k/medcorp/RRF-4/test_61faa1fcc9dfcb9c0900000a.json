    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if vocimagene amiretrorepvec is effective for recurrent high-grade glioma, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that delivering high concentrations of the chemotherapy 5-FU directly to brain tumors via vocimagene amiretrorepvec may benefit patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Document [1] mentions that a phase 1 trial of vocimagene amiretrorepvec and 5-fluorocytosine for recurrent high-grade glioma showed improved overall survival compared to an external control. Document [2] describes a randomized clinical trial comparing vocimagene amiretrorepvec with standard of care, and the results did not show an improvement in overall survival. Document [3] reports durable complete responses in some recurrent high-grade glioma patients treated with Toca 511 + Toca FC (vocimagene amiretrorepvec + extended-release 5-fluorocytosine). Based on this information, it seems that vocimagene amiretrorepvec may have some effectiveness for recurrent high-grade glioma, but more evidence is needed. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
