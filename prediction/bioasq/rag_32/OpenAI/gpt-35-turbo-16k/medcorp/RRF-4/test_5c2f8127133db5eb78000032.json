    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents that provide information about the divergence of whole-genome duplications and small-scale duplications in yeast. Document [0] compares pairs of gene duplicates generated by small-scale duplications with those created by a large-scale gene duplication event (whole-genome duplication) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It finds that whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts. Document [2] compares genes arising from whole gene duplication (WGD) and smaller scale duplication (SSD) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrates that genes duplicated by WGD and SSD are similarly biased with respect to codon bias and evolutionary rate, although differing significantly in their functional constituency. Document [7] also compares the functional evolution of paralogs resulting from whole-genome duplication and smaller-scale duplications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and finds that WGD paralogs are more likely to share interaction partners and biological functions than smaller-scale duplicates. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that whole-genome duplications are generally less divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
