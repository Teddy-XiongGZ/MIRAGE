    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancers are regulatory elements that control gene expression by interacting with gene promoters. They can be located at large distances from the promoters they regulate. The documents mention that enhancers can loop through long distances to come in physical proximity with their target gene promoters. This suggests that enhancers are not directional in their targeting of gene promoters, as they can interact with promoters regardless of their orientation. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
