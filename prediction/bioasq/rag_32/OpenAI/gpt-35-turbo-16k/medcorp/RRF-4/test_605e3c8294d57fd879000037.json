    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if atenolol is metabolized by CYP2D6, we need to search for information about the metabolism of atenolol and its interaction with CYP2D6. From the provided documents, we can see that atenolol is primarily excreted by the renal route and is eliminated largely unchanged. Document [4] states that atenolol is primarily excreted by glomerular filtration and active secretion, and document [24] confirms that atenolol is eliminated largely unchanged. However, there is no direct information about the involvement of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of atenolol. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively conclude whether atenolol is metabolized by CYP2D6 or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
