    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, gepotidacin is a bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor. It inhibits bacterial DNA replication through a mode different from that of fluoroquinolones. It forms gyrase-DNA cleavage complexes and induces gyrase-mediated single-stranded breaks. Therefore, gepotidacin does not activate bacterial topoisomerase, but rather inhibits its activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
