    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if SMOC2 is expressed during wound healing, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that SMOC2 is required for regenerative repair and blocks injury-induced jaw bone osteonecrosis and age-induced periodontal decay. Document [16] states that SMOC2 is involved in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis during wound healing. Document [19] shows that SMOC2 promotes wound healing through the activation of pro-angiogenic factors. Based on this information, it can be concluded that SMOC2 is indeed expressed during wound healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
