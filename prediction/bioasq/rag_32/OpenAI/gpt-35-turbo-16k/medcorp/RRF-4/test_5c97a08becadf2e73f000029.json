    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine the answer by examining the information about the genetic cause of Velocardial facial syndrome (also known as Di George syndrome). Document [2] states that Velocardial facial syndrome is the result of a microdeletion of DNA on a single copy of chromosome 22q11.2. Document [9] also confirms that DiGeorge syndrome (which is another name for Velocardial facial syndrome) is caused by a microdeletion on the long arm of chromosome 22 at a location known as 22q11.2. Therefore, the correct answer is B. no, Velocardial facial syndrome is not caused by a deletion in chromosome 21.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
