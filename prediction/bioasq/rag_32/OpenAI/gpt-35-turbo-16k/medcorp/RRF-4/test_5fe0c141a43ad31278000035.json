    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the Zelda transcription factor is a chromatin remodeller, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that Zelda is required for transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome and influences chromatin accessibility. Document [1] mentions that Zelda is a pioneer factor that can engage nucleosomal DNA and lead to local chromatin remodeling. Document [2] states that Zelda is a pioneer factor essential for remodeling chromatin and driving the initial wave of zygotic gene expression. Document [3] suggests that Zelda acts through specific chromatin patterns of histone modifications to mark developmental enhancers and active promoters. Based on this information, it can be concluded that Zelda is involved in chromatin remodeling. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
