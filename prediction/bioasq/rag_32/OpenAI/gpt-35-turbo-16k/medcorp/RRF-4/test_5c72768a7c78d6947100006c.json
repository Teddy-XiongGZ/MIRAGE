    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is stated that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation are associated with mental impairment. Document [2] mentions that there is an excess of escaping genes associated with mental retardation. Document [3] also suggests that genes that escape X-inactivation may produce their gene products in excess, influencing normal brain growth and differentiation, and provides evidence for the involvement of the X-chromosome in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Document [7] states that X-linked genes have been found to have a general influence on intelligence and specific effects on social-cognition and emotional regulation. Document [13] discusses the role of X-linked genes in neurodevelopmental disorders and the impact of X-chromosome inactivation on their phenotypic expression. Considering this information, the answer to the question is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
