    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, SATB1 is a DNA-binding protein that recognizes AT-rich sequences. Document [0] mentions that SATB1 recognizes an ATC sequence context that consists of a cluster of sequence stretches with well-mixed A's, T's, and C's without G's on one strand. Document [2] also states that SATB1 binds to a special AT-rich sequence context in which one strand is well-mixed A's, T's, and C's, excluding G's (ATC sequences). Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that SATB1 is positioned close to AT-rich sequences.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
