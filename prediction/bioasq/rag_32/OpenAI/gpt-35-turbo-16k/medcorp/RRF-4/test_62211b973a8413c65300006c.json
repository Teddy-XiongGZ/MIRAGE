    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, G-quadruplexes (G4) are indeed possible drug targets for glioblastoma. Document [0] demonstrates that a synthetic G4 ligand, Y2H2-6M(4)-oxazole telomestatin derivative (6OTD), limits the growth of glioblastoma and glioma stem cells (GSCs). Document [2] further supports this by showing that guanine mutations in TMZ-resistant glioblastoma disrupt G4s and create vulnerabilities that can be targeted by G4-stabilizing drugs. Document [7] also highlights the potential of G4-interactive compounds as pharmacologically important molecules. Overall, the evidence suggests that G4s are promising therapeutic targets for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
