    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Circular exons are a type of circular RNA that can be generated through backsplicing. Circular RNAs have been shown to have various functions, but their role in gene expression is still not fully understood. To determine if circular exons increase gene expression, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that circular RNA formation is generally coupled to RNA splicing and that most circular RNAs contain multiple exons. Document [2] states that circular RNA in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is generated through an exon-containing lariat precursor. Document [4] mentions that circular RNAs are usually composed of 1-5 exons. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that circular exons are formed through RNA splicing and can contribute to the generation of circular RNAs. However, there is no direct evidence in the provided documents that suggests circular exons increase gene expression. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
