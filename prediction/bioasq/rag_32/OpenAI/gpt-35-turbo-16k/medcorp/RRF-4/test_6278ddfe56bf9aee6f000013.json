    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, functional tests are commonly used to monitor changes in muscle function in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Document [1] mentions that functional measures such as the motor function measure, 6-minute walk test, timed 10-meter walk/run test, and supine-up time are commonly used in DMD clinical trials. Document [2] also states that functional measures like the 6-minute walk test and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment are important outcome measures for patient follow-up and collaborative studies. Additionally, Document [5] mentions that functional endpoints such as the 10m walk/run, climb four stairs, supine to stand, and six minute walk tests have significant correlations with quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR) biomarkers in DMD. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, functional tests are considered a good biomarker for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
