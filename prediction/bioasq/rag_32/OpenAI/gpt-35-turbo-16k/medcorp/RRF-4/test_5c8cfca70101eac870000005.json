    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, SIRT2 has been associated with cervical cancer. Document [0] states that SIRT2 expression in tumor tissue was negatively correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and FIGO stage in cervical cancer patients. It also mentions that high SIRT2 expression in tumor tissue was a predictive factor for more prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Document [1] supports this by stating that SIRT2 expression level gradually increased in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal cervical tissues. Document [2] also mentions that SIRT2 expression increased during the progression of cervical cancer. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
