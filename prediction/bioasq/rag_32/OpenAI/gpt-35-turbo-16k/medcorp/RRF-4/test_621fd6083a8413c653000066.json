    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to find information about the methylation of RNA in the provided documents. Document [3] mentions that RNA methylation occurs in different RNA species, including tRNA, rRNA, mRNA, and others. However, it does not provide information about whether RNA itself is methylated. Document [7] states that RNA uses a different set of bases than DNA and that uracil, which is present in RNA, is similar to thymine but differs by a methyl group. This suggests that RNA can have methyl groups. Document [19] discusses the possibility of naturally occurring 2'-O-methylated RNA, which has chemical properties intermediate between RNA and DNA. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that RNA can be methylated. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
