    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, cardenolides are indeed inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase. Document [0] states that cardenolide aglycones inhibit the TNF-\u03b1-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by blocking Na+/K+-ATPase. Document [1] mentions that cardenolides specifically inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase, which is essential for many physiological processes. Document [2] also confirms that acetyltylophoroside and tylogenin, which are cardenolides, inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase. Additionally, document [7] states that modulators of Na/K-ATPase, including cardenolides, inhibit Na+/K+ exchange. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
