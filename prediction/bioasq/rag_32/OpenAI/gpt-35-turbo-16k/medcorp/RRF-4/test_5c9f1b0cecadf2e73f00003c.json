    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protamines are small, arginine-rich, nuclear proteins that are involved in sperm chromatin condensation and are essential for sperm head condensation and DNA stabilization. They are predominantly found in testicular spermatids and ejaculated spermatozoa. The documents mention that protamines are the major nuclear proteins in sperm cells and are involved in the correct packaging of the paternal DNA. They are highly expressed during spermiogenesis, the haploid phase of spermatogenesis. However, there is no mention of protamines being ubiquitously expressed in other tissues or cells. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
