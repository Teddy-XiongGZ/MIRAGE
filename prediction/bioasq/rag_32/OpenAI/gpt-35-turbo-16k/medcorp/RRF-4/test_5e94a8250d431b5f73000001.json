    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if protein ALEX1 contains armadillo repeats, we need to examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that ALEX1 contains two armadillo repeat domains. Document [2] also mentions that ALEX1 shares significant homology with uncharacterized ORF KIAA0512 and putative protein product of unknown mRNA (GenBank AF211175), designated here as ALEX2 and ALEX3, respectively. Based on this information, it can be concluded that protein ALEX1 does contain armadillo repeats.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
