    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can conclude that Ameloblastoma (AB) is not always a benign tumor that never metastasizes. While the majority of ameloblastomas are benign and slow-growing, with a low tendency to metastasize, there are rare cases of malignant ameloblastoma and metastasizing ameloblastoma.
