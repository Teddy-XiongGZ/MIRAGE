    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if pazopanib is an effective treatment for glioblastoma, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses a phase I/II trial of pazopanib in combination with lapatinib in adult patients with relapsed malignant glioma. However, the study found limited antitumor activity of this combination at the phase II dose tested. Document [1] describes a phase II trial of pazopanib in adults with recurrent glioblastoma, which showed no improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival. Document [2] provides an overview of novel targeted therapies in glioblastoma, but does not specifically mention pazopanib. Document [5] mentions that bevacizumab, another antiangiogenic agent, has shown some benefit in glioblastoma, but there is no mention of pazopanib. Based on the available information, it appears that pazopanib is not an effective treatment for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
