    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether epidural anesthesia for pain management during labor affects the Apgar score of the infant, we can review the relevant documents. Document [1] states that epidural labor analgesia does not affect the 5-minute Apgar scores of neonates. Document [3] also mentions that there were no significant statistical differences in Apgar scores between the epidural and combined spinal-epidural groups. Document [4] supports this by stating that extending epidural analgesia for intrapartum cesarean section following epidural labor analgesia did not have any adverse effects on neonatal Apgar scores. Document [5] found no differences in Apgar scores between the group receiving epidural analgesia and the group receiving local anesthetic alone. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that epidural anesthesia for pain management during labor does not affect the Apgar score of the infant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
