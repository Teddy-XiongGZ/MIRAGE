    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence to suggest that deflazacort is more efficient than prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Document [0] states that evidence from randomized clinical trials, prospective studies, meta-analyses, and post-hoc analyses suggests that patients receiving deflazacort experience similar or slower rates of functional decline compared with those receiving prednisone/prednisolone. Document [2] mentions that two trials found that deflazacort causes less weight gain than prednisone. Document [9] reports that a randomized controlled trial comparing deflazacort and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy showed that both steroids were equally effective in improving motor function and functional performances, but deflazacort caused fewer side effects, particularly weight gain. Document [12] also supports the idea that deflazacort is associated with fewer side effects than prednisone. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
