    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, vocimagene amiretrorepvec (Toca 511) has shown promise in the treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma, including glioblastoma. Document [1] describes a randomized clinical trial (TOCA 5) comparing overall survival for patients receiving tumor resection followed by Toca 511 with flucytosine (Toca FC) versus standard of care (SOC). The trial showed that Toca 511/FC did not improve overall survival compared to SOC. However, other documents such as [2], [3], [4], [7], [19], and [23] provide evidence of the potential efficacy of Toca 511 in treating recurrent high-grade glioma, including glioblastoma. These documents discuss the positive results observed in preclinical studies, phase I trials, and phase I/II trials, including durable complete responses and prolonged survival. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is A. yes, vocimagene amiretrorepvec (Toca 511) is effective for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
