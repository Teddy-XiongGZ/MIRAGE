    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine whether the chromatin remodeling complex, RSC targets H2A.Z nucleosomes. Document [0] states that RSC has been shown to preferentially evict nucleosomes containing the histone variant H2A.Z in vitro. Document [1] also mentions that RSC preferentially resides on H2B SUMOylated nucleosomes in vivo. Additionally, Document [9] states that RSC targets the RSC chromatin remodeling complex to stress-responsive genes, and these genes are regulated by H3K4 monomethylation, which is inhibiting RSC-independent chromatin remodeling. Therefore, based on this information, the answer is A. yes, the chromatin remodeling complex, RSC targets H2A.Z nucleosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
