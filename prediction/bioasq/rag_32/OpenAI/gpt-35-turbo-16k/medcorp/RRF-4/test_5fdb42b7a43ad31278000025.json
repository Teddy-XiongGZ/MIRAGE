    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, super-enhancers are large clusters of DNA elements that can physically contact their target promoters by chromatin looping during transcription. Insulators, on the other hand, are DNA regulatory elements that can limit the ability of enhancers to target distal genes by forming chromatin loops. Some documents mention the presence of insulators within or at the boundaries of super-enhancers. However, it is not explicitly stated whether super-enhancers themselves are structurally insulated in chromatin loops. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined definitively based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
