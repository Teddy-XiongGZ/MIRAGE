    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of isradipine for Parkinson's disease. Document [0] states that long-term treatment with immediate-release isradipine did not slow the clinical progression of early-stage PD. However, Document [2] suggests that higher isradipine exposure may decrease the risk of needing antiparkinson treatment over 36 months compared with placebo. Document [7] also indicates that longer exposure to isradipine may delay the need for symptomatic medication in early-stage PD. Overall, the evidence is inconclusive and further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of isradipine for Parkinson's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
