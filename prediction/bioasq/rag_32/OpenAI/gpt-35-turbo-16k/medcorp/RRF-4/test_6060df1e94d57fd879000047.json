    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is evidence suggesting that there is an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome. Document [0] states that the functional fraction within the human genome cannot exceed 25%. Document [1] suggests that the functional fraction of the human genome is likely to be no more than \u223c15%. Document [3] estimates that between 6.5% and 10% of the human genome is under functional constraint. Document [6] estimates that 8.2% of the human genome is presently subject to negative selection and thus likely to be functional. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
