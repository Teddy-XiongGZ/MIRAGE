    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nivolumab (Opdivo) is a PD-1 inhibitor, not a PD-L1 inhibitor. PD-1 and PD-L1 are both immune checkpoint proteins involved in regulating the immune response. Nivolumab works by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby preventing the inhibition of T cells and allowing them to attack cancer cells. PD-L1 inhibitors, on the other hand, specifically target the PD-L1 protein to block its interaction with PD-1. Based on the information provided in the documents, there is no mention of Nivolumab being a PD-L1 inhibitor. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
