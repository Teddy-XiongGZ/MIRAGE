    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can conclude that the Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis does play a role in the transfer of histones to leading strand DNA at the replication forks. Document [0] states that mutating the histone-binding domain of the Mcm2 subunit of the CMG helicase results in a marked enrichment of parental histones on the leading strand, indicating that the transfer of histones to the lagging strand is impaired. Document [1] also supports this by showing that the RPC (replisome progression complex), which includes the Mcm2-7 helicase and Ctf4, associates with DNA polymerase alpha (Pol\u03b1) that primes each Okazaki fragment during lagging strand synthesis. Therefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
