    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of Panitumumab in prolonging survival of biliary tract cancer patients. Document [0] states that adding Panitumumab or Bevacizumab to chemotherapy did not meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival at 6 months. Document [1] also mentions that Panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy did not improve overall survival or progression-free survival in patients with biliary cancer. However, Document [3] reports that Panitumumab as first-line therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary tract cancer resulted in a median overall survival of 10.0 months. Document [4] also mentions that Panitumumab in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine showed promising clinical efficacy in biliary tract cancer patients. Overall, the evidence is inconclusive and there is no clear consensus on whether Panitumumab prolongs survival in biliary tract cancer patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
