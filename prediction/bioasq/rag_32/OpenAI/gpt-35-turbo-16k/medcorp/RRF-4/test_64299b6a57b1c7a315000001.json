    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant is less severe than infection caused by other variants, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that Omicron was described as being less fatal and more 'mild' in comparison to past variants. Document [5] also mentions that infections by Omicron were significantly less severe than those caused by Delta and other previous variants, with a lower incidence of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical ventilator use. Document [6] supports this by stating that infections caused by the Omicron variant caused significantly less morbidity, including admission to the hospital and requirement for oxygen supplementation, and significantly less mortality than those caused by the Delta variant. However, it is important to note that Document [14] mentions that the Omicron variant can still cause indirect harm via strain on the healthcare system. Based on this information, the answer is A. yes, COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant is less severe than infection caused by other variants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
