    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide several pieces of evidence that suggest a link between suicide and autism in adolescents. For example, Document [1] mentions that suicide is one of the most common reasons for adolescent death worldwide and that there is a lack of clinical awareness on suicidal behaviors of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study found that the rate of suicidal behaviors was 29% and suicide attempt was 12.7% among adolescents with ASD. Document [9] also mentions that patients with ASD had a higher incidence of suicide attempts than those without ASD. Document [13] also found that being bullied, which is a common experience for adolescents with ASD, was associated with an increased risk of suicidality. Document [22] also found that suicidality in autistic youth is a major public health issue, with the prevalence of suicidal ideation being 25.2% and suicide attempts being 8.3%. These findings suggest that there is indeed an association between suicide and autism in adolescents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
