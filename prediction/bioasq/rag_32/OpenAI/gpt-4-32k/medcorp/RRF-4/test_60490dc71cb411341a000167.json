    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Interferons are described in the documents as proteins that are released by host cells in response to the presence of several viruses. They activate a signal transduction cascade leading to the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) which work alone or in concert to achieve one or more cellular outcomes, including antiviral defense. They provide a first line of defense against virus infections by generating an intracellular environment that restricts virus replication and signals the presence of a viral pathogen to the adaptive arm of the immune response. Therefore, interferons can be considered as defensive proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
