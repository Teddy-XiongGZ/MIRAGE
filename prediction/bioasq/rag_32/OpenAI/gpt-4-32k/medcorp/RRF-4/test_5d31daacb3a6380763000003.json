    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The KRAB-ZNF gene family is one of the largest gene families of transcriptional factors in the human genome. The KRAB domain, found in the amino-terminal region of the proteins, behaves as a transcriptional repressor domain by binding to corepressor proteins, whereas the C2H2 zinc-finger motifs bind DNA. This suggests that the members of the KRAB-ZNF gene family are involved in gene repression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
