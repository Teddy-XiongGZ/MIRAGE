    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several times that antisense therapy, specifically antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), are being used in research and clinical trials for the treatment of Huntington's disease. For example, Document [0] mentions the use of ASOs to degrade Huntingtin mRNA in HD mice. Document [1] mentions that antisense drugs are in development for Huntington's disease among other neurological diseases. Document [17] mentions a clinical trial for an ASO therapy for HD. Therefore, it can be concluded that antisense therapy can be used for Huntington's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
