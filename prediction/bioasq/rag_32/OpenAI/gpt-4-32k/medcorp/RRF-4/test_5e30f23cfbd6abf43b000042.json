    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a lot of information about the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) as a vaccine for smallpox. Document [0] suggests MVA as a leading candidate for an alternative smallpox vaccine. Document [1] mentions that the safety of MVA is well documented and its efficacy against smallpox is currently being addressed. Document [2] states that the MVA-based smallpox vaccine protected macaques against a lethal respiratory challenge with monkeypox virus, suggesting its potential for human protection against smallpox. Document [3] finds MVA to be broadly similar to the traditional Lister vaccine in terms of longevity and efficacy of immunity. Document [23] concludes that immune responses and attenuation of the major cutaneous reaction suggest that this MVA vaccine protected against variola infection. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that Modified Vaccinia Ankara is effective for smallpox.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
