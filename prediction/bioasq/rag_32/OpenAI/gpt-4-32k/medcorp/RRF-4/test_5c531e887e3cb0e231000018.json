    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that ultraconserved enhancers are required for normal development. It mentions that mice with deletions of ultraconserved enhancers showed neurological or growth abnormalities. Document [1] also mentions the importance of ultraconserved sequences in mammalian development. Document [2] suggests that the regulatory properties of ultraconserved enhancers are robust to mutation, indicating their importance in development. Document [3] suggests that ultraconservation identifies a small, functionally indistinct subset of similarly constrained cis-regulatory elements, implying their role in development. Document [5] suggests that ultraconserved sequences work as repressor elements, indicating their role in the regulation of developmental genes. Document [7] suggests that UCEs play a functional role in vertebrate genomes, such as serving as long-range enhancers of flanking genes, regulating splicing and epigenetic modifications, and functioning as transcriptional coactivator. Document [9] suggests that extreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucial functions required for viability. However, this does not negate the importance of ultraconserved enhancers in normal development. Document [13] suggests that redundant enhancers in mice are really important. Document [18] suggests that Evf2, a cloud-forming Dlx5/6 ultraconserved enhancer (UCE) lncRNA, simultaneously localizes to activated (Umad1, 1.6 Mb distant) and repressed (Akr1b8, 27 Mb distant) chr6 target genes, precisely regulating UCE-gene distances and cohesin binding in mouse embryonic forebrain GABAergic interneurons (INs). Document [21] suggests that double-knockouts of UCEs near the ARX gene in mice caused a shrunken hippocampus in the brain. The knockout effects are not lethal in laboratory mice, but could be in the wild. Document [23] suggests that Evf2 selectively regulates UCE interactions with multi-megabase distant genes through complex effects on chromosome topology, linking lncRNA-dependent topological and transcriptional control with interneuron diversity and seizure susceptibility. Document [30] suggests that nonexonic UCEs are also depleted among 10 of 11 recent genomewide data sets of human CNVs, including 3 obtained with strategies permitting greater precision in determining the extents of CNVs. We further present observations suggesting that nonexonic UCEs per se may contribute to this depletion and that their apparent dosage sensitivity was in effect when they became fixed in the last common ancestor of mammals, birds, and reptiles, consistent with dosage sensitivity contributing to ultraconservation. Finally, in searching for the mechanism(s) underlying the function of nonexonic UCEs, we have found that they are enriched in TAATTA, which is also the recognition sequence for the homeodomain DNA-binding module, and bounded by a change in A + T frequency. All these documents suggest that ultraconserved enhancers are important for normal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
