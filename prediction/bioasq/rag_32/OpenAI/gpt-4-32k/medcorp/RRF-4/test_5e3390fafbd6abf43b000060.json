    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the risk of colon cancer between those both with and without radiation treatment diverged beginning at approximately 8 years. After 8 years, the hazard ratio for developing colon cancer was 2.00 for women with radiation versus those without radiation treatment. Document [1] also mentions that individuals who have received pelvic irradiation are reported to be at increased risk to develop subsequent malignancies in the large bowel. Document [17] also states that radiotherapy increased the risk of second cancers among cervical cancer patients.
