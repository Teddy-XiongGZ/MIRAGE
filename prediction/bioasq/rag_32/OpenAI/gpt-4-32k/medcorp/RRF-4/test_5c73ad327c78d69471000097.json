    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what tremelimumab is. According to Document [0], tremelimumab is an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of mesothelioma. However, the same document states that it did not improve the overall survival of patients who failed on first-line or second-line chemotherapy compared with placebo in the DETERMINE study. Document [1] also mentions that the NIBIT-MESO-1 study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tremelimumab combined with durvalumab in patient with unresectable mesothelioma, but it does not specifically mention improvement in survival. Document [8] states that tremelimumab did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with placebo in patients with previously treated malignant mesothelioma. Document [29] also mentions that a phase 3 study did not meet its primary end points of improved overall survival with durvalumab vs chemotherapy or improved overall survival or progression-free survival with durvalumab plus tremelimumab vs chemotherapy in patients with \u226525% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1. Therefore, based on these documents, it seems that tremelimumab does not improve survival of mesothelioma patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
