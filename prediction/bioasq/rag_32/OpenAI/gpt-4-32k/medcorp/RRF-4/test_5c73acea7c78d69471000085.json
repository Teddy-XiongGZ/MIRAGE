    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what dacomitinib is. According to Document [0], dacomitinib is an oral, irreversible, second-generation, pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, used in the treatment of glioblastoma. However, the document also mentions that despite some patients showing significant benefit, the overall results of Dacomitinib in recurrent GB were poor. Document [1] also confirms the antitumoral efficacy of dacomitinib, but mentions that continuous administration of the compound was required to maintain the antitumor effect. Document [2] states that Dacomitinib has limited single-agent activity in recurrent GB with EGFR amplification. Document [3] cautions against the use of dacomitinib for pediatric brain tumor clinical trials. Document [7] concludes that while dacomitinib was not effective in most patients with EGFR-amplified GBM, a subset experienced a durable, clinically meaningful benefit. However, EGFRvIII and EGFR ECD mutation status in archival tumors did not predict clinical benefit. Document [19] suggests that dacomitinib improves response rate and progression-free survival in patients with recurrent GBM compared to historical controls. However, the addition of sunitinib, to test the best in vitro combination therapy, did not translate to any additional in vivo benefit. Based on these documents, it seems that while dacomitinib has shown some benefits in certain patients, its overall effectiveness in treating glioblastoma is limited and inconsistent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
