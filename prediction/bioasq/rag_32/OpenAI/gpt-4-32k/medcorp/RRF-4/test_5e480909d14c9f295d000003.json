    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents suggest that astronauts are exposed to higher levels of radiation in space, which could potentially increase their risk of developing cancer. For example, Document [0] mentions that space is a hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation posing significant hazards to the health of astronauts, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Document [1] also mentions that the astronauts had a higher age-specific risk of cancer mortality than the comparison group. However, other documents such as Document [16] and Document [17] suggest that there is no significant increase in cancer among astronauts compared to the general population. Therefore, the evidence is mixed and it's not clear cut whether astronauts are at a higher risk for developing cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
