    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that COVID-19-induced anosmia is caused by several factors, including inflammation of the olfactory clefts, damage to the olfactory epithelium or olfactory central nervous system, and damage to non-neuronal cells which affects the normal olfactory metabolism. However, there is also mention of a disruption of nuclear architecture in the olfactory system, which could contribute to the development of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, while it may not be the sole cause, disruption of nuclear architecture could be a contributing factor to COVID-19-induced anosmia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
