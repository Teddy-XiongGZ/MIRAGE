    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] and [1] mention that mutations of SETD1A have been linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia. Document [2] also supports this by stating that SETD1A encodes a histone methyltransferase whose de novo mutations are identified in schizophrenia patients and confer a large increase in disease risk. Document [9] also states that rare loss-of-function variants in SETD1A are associated with schizophrenia. Document [10] highlights the contribution of loss-of-function mutations in SETD1A to the genetic architecture of schizophrenia. Document [14] also mentions that SETD1A is a key schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Document [27] also mentions that protein-truncating variants in SETD1A confer a substantial risk of schizophrenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
