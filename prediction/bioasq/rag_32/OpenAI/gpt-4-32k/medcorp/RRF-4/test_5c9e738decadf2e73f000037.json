    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that functional mitochondrial transfer has been documented between human mesenchymal stem cells and human lung carcinoma cells. Document [1] also mentions that mitochondria or mtDNA can move between cells. Document [3] states that horizontal transfer of mitochondria is the movement of whole mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA between cells. Document [5] mentions that in vivo horizontal transfer of mitochondria can occur in cancer cells. Document [9] mentions that mitochondria were recently found to actively travel between cells through nanotubes or extracellular vesicles. Document [11] provides evidence of in vivo horizontal mitochondrial gene transfer. Document [13] explains that horizontal transfer of mitochondria is mediated by actin-rich membrane protrusions named tunneling nanotubes. Document [14] mentions that mitochondria can traverse cell boundaries and thus be horizontally transferred between cells. Document [16] mentions that numerous studies have described the transfer of mitochondria from stem cells to injured cells. Document [19] mentions that the intercellular transport of mitochondria, defined as horizontal mitochondrial transfer, can occur in mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo. Document [21] mentions that mitochondria with their mitochondrial DNA payload not only can, but do move between cells in tumour models and in mouse models of tissue damage. Document [29] mentions a novel method for single cells mitochondria transplantation using 'nanosyringe'. Document [31] mentions that tunneling nanotubes have been implicated as one mechanism by which whole mitochondria can be transferred from cell to cell. All these documents provide evidence that mitochondria can transfer from cell to cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
