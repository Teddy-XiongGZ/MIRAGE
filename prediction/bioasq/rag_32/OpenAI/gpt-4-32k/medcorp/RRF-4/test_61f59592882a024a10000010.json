    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for sotrovimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in people who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Document [2] mentions that monoclonal antibodies like sotrovimab are known to prevent progression of the disease and hospitalization. Document [3] reports two cases of patients with persistent COVID-19 that were treated with sotrovimab, resulting in a rapid improvement of symptoms. Document [5] concludes that sotrovimab was found to reduce the risk of progression of COVID-19 when administrated early to non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Document [15] concludes that among high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, sotrovimab reduced the risk of disease progression. Document [19] concludes that a single intravenous dose of sotrovimab, compared with placebo, significantly reduced the risk of a composite end point of all-cause hospitalization or death through day 29. Document [20] concludes that sotrovimab could be an effective and safe treatment option to reduce mortality and hospitalisation rate in both Delta and Omicron Variants of COVID-19. Document [23] concludes that sotrovimab treatment was associated with a 63% decrease in the odds of all-cause hospitalization and an 89% decrease in the odds of all-cause 28-day mortality among COVID-19 outpatients during the Delta variant phase. Document [26] concludes that sotrovimab treatment was associated with a lower rate of progression to oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or mortality. Document [27] reports a case of a child, who was treated early with sotrovimab after a kidney transplant, and the clinical course was successful. Document [30] concludes that monoclonal antibodies are reasonably well-tolerated COVID-19 therapies in high-risk adolescent and young adult populations. All these documents provide evidence that sotrovimab is effective for the treatment of COVID-19.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
