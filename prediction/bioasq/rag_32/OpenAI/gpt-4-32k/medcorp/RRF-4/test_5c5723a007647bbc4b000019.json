    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention multiple times that yeast prions have been used as models for studying the mechanisms of human amyloid diseases. For example, Document [13] states that 'Yeast prions have become important models for the study of the basic mechanisms underlying human amyloid diseases.' Similarly, Document [27] mentions that 'Yeast prions increasingly are serving as models for the understanding and treatment of many mammalian amyloidoses.' Therefore, it is clear that yeast prions have indeed become important models for the study of human amyloid diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
