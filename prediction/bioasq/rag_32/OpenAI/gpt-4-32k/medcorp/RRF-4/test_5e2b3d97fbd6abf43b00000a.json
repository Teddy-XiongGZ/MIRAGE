    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"BNN27 is a synthetic analogue of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with potent antioxidant properties and its involvement in cognition has recently been shown. According to the documents, BNN27 has been shown to counteract memory deficits in various studies. For example, it counteracted delay-dependent deficits in the novel object task in rats, suggesting that this DHEA derivative affected acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. It also counteracted the cognition deficits induced by anesthetic ketamine. Therefore, BNN27 does not promote memory loss, but rather appears to have a protective effect on memory.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
