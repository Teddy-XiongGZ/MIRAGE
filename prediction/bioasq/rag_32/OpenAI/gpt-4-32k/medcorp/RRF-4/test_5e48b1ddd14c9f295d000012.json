    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, particularly in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). However, its use in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is less clear. Document [0] states that natalizumab has found limited use in SPMS due to insufficient evidence of efficacy. Document [3] also mentions that the efficacy of natalizumab therapy in SPMS is currently being investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Document [16] states that natalizumab treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis did not reduce progression on the primary multicomponent disability endpoint in part 1 of their study. Document [30] also mentions that natalizumab treatment of progressive MS reduces intrathecal inflammation and tissue damage, but it does not clearly state that it improves the disease course of SPMS. Therefore, based on the available documents, it seems that there is not enough evidence to conclusively state that natalizumab improves the disease course of SPMS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
