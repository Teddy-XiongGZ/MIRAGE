    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that some cohesin variants tested caused changes to transcription, including altered expression of gene encoding lineage-specifying developmental regulators. Document [3] also mentions that cohesin regulates gene transcription. Document [20] states that cohesin-SA1 mediates cohesion at telomeres, which is required for their replication. Telomere defects in SA1- deficient cells provoke chromosome segregation errors resulting in aneuploidy despite robust centromere cohesion. This aneuploidy could explain why heterozygous animals have an earlier onset of tumorigenesis. In addition, the genome-wide distribution of cohesin changes dramatically in the absence of SA1, and the complex shows reduced accumulation at promoters and CTCF sites. As a consequence, gene expression is altered, leading to downregulation of biological processes related to a developmental disorder linked to cohesin function, the Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS). These results point out a prominent role of cohesin-SA1 in transcriptional regulation, with clear implications in the etiology of CdLS. Therefore, it can be concluded that deletion of cohesin does indeed change gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
