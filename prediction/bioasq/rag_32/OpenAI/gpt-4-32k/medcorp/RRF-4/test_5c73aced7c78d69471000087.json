    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that a study assessing the efficacy of inositol in the treatment of trichotillomania found no differences in symptom reductions between inositol and placebo. Document [24] also states that there was insufficient evidence from meta-analysis to confirm or refute the efficacy of any agent or class of medication for the treatment of trichotillomania in adults, children or adolescents. Preliminary evidence suggests there may be beneficial treatment effects for N-acetylcysteine, clomipramine and olanzapine in adults based on four trials, albeit with relatively small sample sizes. Inositol is not mentioned as a beneficial treatment. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that inositol is not effective for trichotillomania.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
