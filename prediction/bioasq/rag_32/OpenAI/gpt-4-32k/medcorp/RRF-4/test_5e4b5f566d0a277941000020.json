    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that celecoxib did not slow the decline in muscle strength, vital capacity, motor unit number estimates, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, or affect survival in ALS patients. Document [1] shows that celecoxib had no therapeutic effect when administered individually, but when combined with Ciprofloxacin, it showed significant improvement in ALS zebrafish models. However, this is not directly applicable to human patients. Document [2] suggests that the combination of celecoxib with creatine produced additive neuroprotective effects and extended survival in a mouse model of ALS, but again, this is not directly applicable to human patients. Document [3] and [4] do not provide any information on the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating ALS. Document [5] suggests that celecoxib treatment significantly delayed the onset of weakness and weight loss and prolonged survival by 25% in a mouse model of ALS. However, this is not directly applicable to human patients. Document [6] does not provide any information on the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating ALS. Document [7] suggests that celecoxib treatment increased SMN levels, improved motor function and enhanced survival in a severe SMA mouse model. However, this is not directly applicable to human patients. Document [8] suggests that oral administration of celecoxib extended the survival of G93A SOD1 mice as compared to littermate controls. However, this is not directly applicable to human patients. Document [9] to [31] do not provide any information on the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating ALS. Therefore, based on the available documents, celecoxib is not effective in treating human patients with ALS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
