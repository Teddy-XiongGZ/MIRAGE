    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for brain tumors and that the risk of both types of tumors was positively associated with dose. Document [1] also mentions that radiation can induce meningiomas. Document [2] also confirms that radiation doses on the order of 1 to 2 Gy can significantly increase the risk of neural tumors. Document [4] mentions that cranial X radiation therapy was the standard of care for treating dermatological conditions until the 1960s, when its association to cancer and particularly high rates of brain tumors was discovered. Document [6] also mentions that high dose radiation-induced meningiomas are a rare, severe and late complication of craniospinal radiotherapy for brain tumors. Document [7] also mentions that the long-term or delayed side effects of irradiation on neural tissue are now known to include the induction of new central nervous system neoplasms. Document [8] also mentions that three patients developed cerebral gliomas decades after exposure to low-dose x-ray irradiation in childhood for the treatment of tinea capitis. Document [9] also mentions that the mean age of the patients with low-dose radiation-induced meningiomas was 58 years and the mean shortest onset latency was 48 years. Document [10] also mentions that the thyroid dose was estimated to be 6 +/- 2 rad and the pituitary dose was 49 +/- 6 rad for the conventional tinea capitis treatment. Document [11] also mentions that despite the recognition of ionizing radiation as a causal risk factor for a variety of solid tumors (including brain tumors), to date, such an association with pituitary adenoma (PA) has not been demonstrated. Document [12] also mentions that the objective of the study is to characterize the risk of tumors from radiation exposure to the head and neck. Document [13] also mentions that radiation-induced gliomas are uncommon, with only 73 cases on record to date. Document [14] also mentions that basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been mostly associated with sun exposure, but ionizing radiation is also a known risk factor. Document [15] also mentions that the authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical and histopathological findings in 201 patients with intracranial meningiomas operated on in the period 1978 to 1982. Document [16] also mentions that high dose radiation-induced meningiomas are a rare, severe and late complication of craniospinal radiotherapy for brain tumors. Document [17] also mentions that the long-term or delayed side effects of irradiation on neural tissue are now known to include the induction of new central nervous system neoplasms. Document [18] also mentions that nontargeted late effects of radiation include an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, although this is still debatable in the context of low-dose radiation. Document [19] also mentions that basal cell carcinomas are the most frequent tumors arising on chronic radiodermatitis. Document [20] also mentions that the health risks from low-dose sparsely ionizing (low-LET) radiation have been the subject of continued debate. Document [21] also mentions that the health risks from low-dose sparsely ionizing (low-LET) radiation have been the subject of continued debate. Document [22] also mentions that radiation-induced gliomas are uncommon, with only 73 cases on record to date. Document [23] also mentions that head irradiation, the acceptable mode of treatment for tinea capitis in the past, is recognized today as a causative factor for meningioma. Document [24] also mentions that the risk of developing a tumor of the nervous system in humans is analysed in several studies of populations, exposed to ionising radiation for medical reasons, or exposed to military or occupational radiation. Document [25] also mentions that development of skin neoplasms is the most important complication of radiation therapy. Document [26] also mentions that radiation-induced gliomas are uncommon, with only 73 cases on record to date. Document [27] also mentions that the risk of developing a tumor of the nervous system in humans is analysed in several studies of populations, exposed to ionising radiation for medical reasons, or exposed to military or occupational radiation. Document [28] also mentions that a 39-year-old male developed primary brain lymphoma 33 years after receiving scalp irradiation for tinea capitis. Document [29] also mentions that the article deals with 6 patients operated on for meningioma many years after they had undergone X-ray therapy because of an epidemic of tinea capitis in their community. Document [30] also mentions that head irradiation, the acceptable mode of treatment for tinea capitis in the past, is recognized today as a causative factor for meningioma. Document [31] also mentions that ionizing radiation is the only established risk factor recognized today in the causation of meningioma. All these documents provide evidence that radiation for tinea capitis increases the risk of brain tumors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
