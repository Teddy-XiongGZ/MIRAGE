    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] states that Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induces the enzyme indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO) in a variety of human cell types. Document [1] also mentions that IDO activity in human macrophages and dendritic cells is triggered by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). Document [2] also mentions the induction of IDO by IFN-\u03b3. Document [4] also mentions that IDO expression is up-regulated by IFN-gamma in various cell types. Document [13] also mentions that IFN-\u03b3 suppresses inflammation in CIA via suppressing Th17 which is involved in the pathogenesis of CIA. Document [18] also mentions that IFN-\u03b3 is a potent inducer of IDO in APCs. Document [21] also mentions that IFN-\u03b3 is known to have contradictory effects on allograft survival via effects on both, the immune system and on the graft itself. Document [23] also mentions that IDO-expressing allogenic fibroblasts suppress the proliferation of allogenic immune cells, while they still remain viable in this IDO-induced tryptophan-deficient culture environment caused by IDO. Document [26] also mentions that IDO is an intracellular enzyme possessing various immunosuppressive properties. Document [27] also mentions that IDO is a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, is an intracellular enzyme possessing various immunosuppressive properties. Document [28] also mentions that IDO is a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, is an intracellular enzyme possessing various immunosuppressive properties. Document [29] also mentions that IDO is a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, is an intracellular enzyme possessing various immunosuppressive properties. Document [30] also mentions that IDO is a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, is an intracellular enzyme possessing various immunosuppressive properties. Document [31] also mentions that IDO is a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, is an intracellular enzyme possessing various immunosuppressive properties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
