    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ibudilast has been approved for 'fast track' development by the FDA as a potential treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) as stated in Document [0]. Document [1] and Document [2] show that ibudilast has been found to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties and it was shown to have an effect on preserving brain volume and disability progression in MS patients. Document [7] also shows that in a phase 2 trial involving patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, ibudilast was associated with slower progression of brain atrophy than placebo. Document [6] also shows that ibudilast treatment was associated with a reduction in gray matter atrophy. Document [15] shows that the previously reported overall treatment effect of ibudilast on worsening of brain atrophy in progressive MS appears to be driven by patients with PPMS. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that ibudilast is effective for multiple sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
