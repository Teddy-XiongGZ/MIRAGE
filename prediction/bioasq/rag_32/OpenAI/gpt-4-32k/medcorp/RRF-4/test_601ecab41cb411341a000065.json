    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that adenosine signaling is prognostic for cancer outcome and has predictive utility for immunotherapeutic response. This is further supported by Document [2] which mentions that adenosine signaling plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. Document [6] also mentions that adenosine pathway is being targeted in immuno-oncology with several clinical programs. Therefore, it can be concluded that adenosine signaling is prognostic for cancer outcome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
