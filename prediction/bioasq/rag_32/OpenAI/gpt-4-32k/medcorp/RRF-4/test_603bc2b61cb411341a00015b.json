    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple documents mention a connection between Arginine Vasopressin Peptide (AVP) and autism. For instance, Document [0] suggests that AVP plays a central role in the modulation of mammalian social behavior and its involvement in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is suggested. Document [1] also mentions the involvement of AVP in ASD. Document [2] suggests that AVP plays regulatory roles in social behaviors and its levels seem to be associated with specific autistic symptoms. Document [24] also mentions that AVP has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of autism. Therefore, it can be concluded that autism is thought to be related to the Arginine Vasopressin Peptide (AVP).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
