    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epigenetic changes refer to modifications in gene expression that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. According to the documents, these changes can be heritable, meaning they can be passed down from one generation to the next. Document [0] states that epigenetics involves heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. Document [1] also mentions that epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable. Document [4] talks about heritable epigenetic changes that can be associated with physical or chemical changes in molecules. Document [7] mentions that DNA methylation and histone modification, which are epigenetic processes, are heritable. Therefore, the answer is yes, epigenetic changes are heritable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
