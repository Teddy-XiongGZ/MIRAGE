    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"G-quadruplexes (G4) are higher-order nucleic acid structures formed by guanine-rich sequences. According to the documents, G4 stabilization by small-molecule compounds often causes cytotoxicity, which can be beneficial in cancer treatment. Specifically, a synthetic G4 ligand, Y2H2-6M(4)-oxazole telomestatin derivative (6OTD), has been shown to limit the growth of glioblastoma and glioma stem cells. This indicates that G4s can be targeted for glioblastoma treatment. Therefore, G-quadruplexes are potential drug targets for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
