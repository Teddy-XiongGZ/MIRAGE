    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are mentioned in several documents. Document [0] states that cytochrome P450 epoxidases metabolize arachidonic acid to a mixture of EETs. Document [1] also mentions that cytochrome P450 enzymes generate EETs from arachidonic acid. Document [5] states that cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases convert arachidonic acid to four EET regioisomers. These documents clearly indicate that EETs are synthesized by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases from arachidonic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
