    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided contain multiple references to NfL being a biomarker for neurodegeneration. For instance, Document [0] mentions that NfL can detect neurological diseases in their preclinical phase. Document [1] also mentions that NfL is a promising biomarker for neurological diseases. Document [2] further supports this by stating that NfL is a marker of neuronal damage. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, it can be concluded that NfL is a biomarker of neurodegeneration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
