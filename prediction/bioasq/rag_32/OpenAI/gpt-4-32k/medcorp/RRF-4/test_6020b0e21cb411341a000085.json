    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that the combination of eflornithine and sulindac did not significantly lower the incidence of disease progression in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis compared to either drug alone. Document [2] also supports this, stating that eflornithine-sulindac combination therapy was superior to either drug alone in delaying or preventing the need for lower GI tract surgery in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. However, it's important to note that this was a post hoc analysis and the sample size was small. Document [21] also mentions that the combination of DFMO and sulindac reduced intestinal tumor number by more than 80% in a study, but it's unclear if this effect persists after treatment discontinuation. Overall, while there is some evidence that the combination of eflornithine and sulindac can have a positive effect on familial adenomatous polyposis, it does not seem to be significantly more effective than either drug alone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
