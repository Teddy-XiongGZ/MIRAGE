    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what the documents say about the comparison between machine learning-based methods and statistical methods for survival analysis. Document [5] suggests that machine learning methods do not always outperform traditional statistical approaches, and in some cases, they provide similar results. Document [6] indicates that machine learning models such as random survival forests, gradient boosted survival model, and survival support vector machine can outperform traditional statistical methods like the Cox proportional hazard model. However, Document [19] suggests that machine learning techniques may not provide significantly higher performance compared to more traditional statistical approaches. From these documents, it seems that the performance of machine learning methods compared to statistical methods can vary depending on the specific context and dataset. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that machine learning methods always outperform statistical methods for survival analysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
