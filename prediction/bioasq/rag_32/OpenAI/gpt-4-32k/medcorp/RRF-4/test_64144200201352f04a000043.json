    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaphylaxis is described in multiple documents as a severe allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and potentially lethal. This reaction is typically induced by an otherwise innocuous substance. In Document [0], it is stated that in IgE-dependent and other examples of anaphylaxis, tissue mast cells and circulating basophilic granulocytes (basophils) are thought to represent major sources of the biologically active mediators that contribute to the pathology of anaphylaxis. Document [1] also states that anaphylaxis results from severe systemic mast cell activation. Therefore, it is clear that anaphylaxis is a result of mast cell activation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
