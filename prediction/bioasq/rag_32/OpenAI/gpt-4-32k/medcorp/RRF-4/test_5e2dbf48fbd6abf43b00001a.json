    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what phase IV clinical trials are. According to Document [2], phase IV clinical trials are post-marketing studies to delineate additional information including the drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use. They are conducted after a treatment has been approved and is being marketed. Now, I need to find information about ProSavin's clinical trials. Document [1] mentions a phase I/II trial for ProSavin. Document [3] also talks about a phase I/II trial and a long-term follow-up of the same. Document [18] mentions that ProSavin was superseded by AXO-Lenti-PD (OXB-102), an optimized version of the drug. However, there is no mention of a phase IV trial for ProSavin in any of the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
