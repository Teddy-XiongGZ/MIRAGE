    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] shows that SATB1 is induced in response to TCR signaling during early thymocyte development and its upregulation correlates with positive selection of thymocytes. Document [2] shows that reduced expression of SATB1 leads to a significant reduction in the percentage of CD8SP T cells in thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. Document [3] shows that T cell numbers were reduced in SATB1 conditional knockout mice, mainly because of a deficiency in positive selection at the CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive stage during T cell development in the thymus. Document [4] shows that SATB1-null mice have multiple defects in T-cell development. Document [17] shows that SATB1 is a global chromatin organizer which controls gene expression by folding and remodeling chromatin, important in differentiation and apoptosis. All these documents suggest that SATB1 is necessary for T-cell maturation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
