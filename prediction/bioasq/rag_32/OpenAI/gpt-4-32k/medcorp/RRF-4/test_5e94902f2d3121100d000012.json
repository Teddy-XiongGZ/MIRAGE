    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aggrephagy is described in multiple documents as a selective form of autophagy. Document [1] defines aggrephagy as the selective degradation of protein aggregates by macroautophagy. Document [2] refers to aggrephagy as the selective degradation of protein aggregates by macroautophagy. Document [20] also mentions aggrephagy as a selective form of autophagy. Therefore, it is clear that aggrephagy is a variant of autophagy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
