    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [5] states that Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) has been implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. However, it also mentions that GRG5 has a previously unknown role in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions. This suggests that GRG5 does not only have a role in late development, but also in early development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
