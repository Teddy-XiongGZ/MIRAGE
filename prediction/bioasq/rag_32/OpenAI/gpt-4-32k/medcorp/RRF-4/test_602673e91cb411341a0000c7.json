    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what Lanabecestat is. According to Document [1], Lanabecestat is an oral beta-secretase 1 cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor, which in theory would prevent the buildup of beta-amyloid and may help slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, the same document also mentions that in June 2018, it was announced that the ongoing Phase III clinical trials for Lanabecestat were not likely to meet their primary endpoint and that all current trials would be stopped due to futility. This suggests that Lanabecestat was not effective in treating Alzheimer's disease. Document [8] also confirms that the studies were terminated early due to futility and that Lanabecestat did not slow cognitive or functional decline. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that Lanabecestat is not effective for Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
