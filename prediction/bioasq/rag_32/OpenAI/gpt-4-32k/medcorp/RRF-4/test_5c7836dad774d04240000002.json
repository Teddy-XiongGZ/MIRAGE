    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are described in multiple documents as multipotent cells. For instance, Document [0] mentions that MSCs are an independent and heterogeneous group of progenitors with distinct self-renewal properties and established differentiation potentials. Document [1] also mentions that MSCs have the ability to differentiate into different tissues. Document [9] further explains that MSCs can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that MSCs are indeed multipotent cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
