    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is a condition where patients experience neurological symptoms such as weakness, movement disorders, sensory symptoms, and blackouts. These symptoms are not associated with a definable organic disease but are real and distressing, caused by an incorrect functioning of the brain. The term 'psychosomatic' refers to physical symptoms that are thought to be direct manifestations of psychological factors. While FND can be associated with psychological stressors, it is not solely due to psychological issues. The development of FND is dependent on complex interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors. Therefore, it would not be accurate to classify FND as a psychosomatic disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
