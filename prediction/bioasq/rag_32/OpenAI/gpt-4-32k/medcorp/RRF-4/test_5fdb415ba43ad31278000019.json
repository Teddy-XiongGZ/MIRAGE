    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nanog is a key factor in maintaining pluripotency in stem cells, as mentioned in multiple documents. Document [0] states that Nanog's repression correlates with the loss of pluripotency and stem cell differentiation, implying that it is not repressed in pluripotent stem cells. Document [1] also mentions that pluripotent stem cells have heterogeneous levels of Nanog, suggesting that it is not universally repressed. Document [3] further supports this by stating that Nanog is essential for maintaining pluripotency. Therefore, it can be concluded that Nanog is not repressed in pluripotent stem cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
