    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about indinavir and its effectiveness in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Document [2] mentions a trial of indinavir in ALS patients, but the results showed no significant differences in the rate of decline between the groups, and the study concluded that the negative efficacy trends discourage further indinavir trials in ALS. Document [0] and [1] also mention that indinavir was among the drugs tested for ALS that were not shown to be effective in clinical trials. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that indinavir is not effective for the treatment of ALS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
