    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 mentions that glucose starvation induces changes in mRNA transcription, including the fbp1 gene in yeast. Document 1 also mentions that glucose starvation triggers changes in the transcription of the fbp1 gene. Document 2 states that the levels of the FBP1 mRNA decrease rapidly when glucose is added to the medium, implying that the absence of glucose (starvation) would increase its levels. Document 3 also mentions that glucose strongly represses the transcription of the FBP1 gene. These documents provide evidence that the yeast fbp1 gene is indeed affected by glucose starvation stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
