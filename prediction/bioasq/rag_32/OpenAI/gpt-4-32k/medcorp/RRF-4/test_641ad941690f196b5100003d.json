    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"LOD stands for Limit of Detection and LOQ stands for Limit of Quantification. According to Document [2], LOD is the lowest analyte concentration likely to be reliably distinguished from the Limit of Blank (LoB) and at which detection is feasible. On the other hand, LOQ is the lowest concentration at which the analyte can not only be reliably detected but at which some predefined goals for bias and imprecision are met. Therefore, LOD and LOQ are not the same.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
