    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who were treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib lived nearly three times longer without their cancer worsening if their tumors had mutations in at least one of 12 DNA repair genes. Document [1] also mentions that Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, received a U.S. Food and Drug Administration breakthrough therapy designation in January 2016 for the treatment of patients with BRCA1/2 or ATM gene-mutated mCRPC based on results of a compelling phase II trial of olaparib in patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (TOPARP-A). This study found that men with mCRPC and genetic mutations in DNA damage repair genes had an overall response rate of nearly 90% with olaparib treatment. Document [2] also mentions that in May 2020, the first PARP inhibitor, olaparib, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for men with mCRPC with HHR gene mutations based on the findings of the Phase III PROfound trial that showed improved overall survival in men with mCRPC who received olaparib and whose disease had progressed on a novel hormonal agent. These documents provide strong evidence that Olaparib is effective for prostate cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
