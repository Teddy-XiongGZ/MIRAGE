    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that YKL-40 is used as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. For instance, Document [0] mentions that YKL-40 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid could be potentially used as a biomarker for the prognosis of mild cognitive impairment and the likelihood of progression to Alzheimer's disease. Document [1] also mentions that YKL-40 may discriminate Alzheimer's disease from controls and may predict the progression from the early preclinical to the late dementia stage. Therefore, it can be concluded that YKL-40 is used as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
