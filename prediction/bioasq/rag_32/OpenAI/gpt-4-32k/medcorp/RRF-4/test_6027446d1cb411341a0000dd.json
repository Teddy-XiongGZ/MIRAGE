    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that trimetazidine has a protective effect on the myocardium during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). For example, Document [0] states that trimetazidine could reduce the frequency of angina pectoris attacks and myocardial damage during PCI. Document [1] suggests that trimetazidine may reduce periprocedural myocardial injury in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI. Document [2] reports that in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI, early trimetazidine reduced myocardial infarction size. Document [7] suggests that pre-procedural acute oral trimetazidine administration significantly reduces PCI-induced myocardial infarction. Document [25] states that trimetazidine can reduce the post-PCI cTnI release and improve left ventricular function after PCI in patients with unstable angina pectoris. Therefore, the answer is yes, trimetazidine does protect from myocardial injury after percutaneous coronary intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
