    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that there was a significant correlation between the incidence of meningioma and the dose of radiation to the brain among Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors. Document [1] also shows a high correlation between incidence of meningiomas and distance from the hypocenter among Nagasaki atomic-bomb survivors. Document [2] states that radiation exposure is among the few factors known to be associated with risk of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, including meningioma. Document [4] mentions that atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima had a higher than typical frequency of developing meningiomas. These documents provide strong evidence that there is an increased risk of meningiomas in atomic bomb survivors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
