    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 mentions that two lncRNAs were identified that regulate the extent of neuronal outgrowth. Document 1 also mentions that lncRNA BC089918 had a particular promoting effect on neurite outgrowth. Document 3 mentions that lncRNA uc.217 played an important regulative role in peripheral nerve regeneration. Document 4 mentions that lncRNA Malat1 promotes neurite outgrowth. Document 6 mentions that the lncRNA Arrl1 decreases neurite outgrowth after neuronal injury. Document 9 mentions that the lncRNA MALAT1/miR-30/Spastin Axis Regulates Hippocampal Neurite Outgrowth. Document 10 mentions that lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) promotes the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells contributing to axon outgrowth. Document 13 mentions that lncRNA BDNF-AS promotes neurite outgrowth. Document 29 mentions that lncRNA FTX involves in the Nogo-66-Induced Inhibition of Neurite Outgrowth. All these documents provide evidence that there are lncRNAs that control the extent of neuronal outgrowth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
