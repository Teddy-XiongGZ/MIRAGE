    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents mention the use of machine learning methods to predict the severity of major depressive disorder (MDD). For instance, Document [18] talks about a machine learning model that predicts the severity of depressive symptoms. Document [23] also mentions a machine learning approach that predicts the severity of depressive symptoms. Document [29] discusses a machine learning methodology that predicts the efficacy of SSRI antidepressant therapy for MDD, which indirectly relates to the severity of the disorder. Therefore, it can be concluded that machine learning methods have indeed been used to predict the severity of MDD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
