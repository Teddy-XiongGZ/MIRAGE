Although the combination did not result in significant increases in progression-free survival or overall survival compared with atezolizumab alone, some patients demonstrated evidence of an anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response and appeared to fare better. This suggests that CMB305 can be used against sarcomas, but further evaluation is needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
