    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tumour specific antigens are proteins that are expressed by tumour cells and can be recognized by the immune system. These antigens can originate from various sources, including mutations in protein coding genes, overexpression of certain genes, and activation of normally silent genes. Document [15] provides a classification of tumor antigens, including products of mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, products of other mutated genes, overexpressed or aberrantly expressed cellular proteins, among others. Document [19] also mentions that some genes are expressed by tumor cells and not by normal cells, and that the transformed cells often express permanently some viral genes. This leads to the presentation of viral antigenic peptides absent from normal cells. Therefore, it can be concluded that tumour specific antigens can indeed originate from known protein coding genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
