    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Methionine is the amino acid that is coded by the start codon AUG, which signals the initiation of protein translation from mRNA. This means that methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of proteins during translation. However, it's also mentioned that methionine can be removed by post-translational modification. Therefore, while all proteins start with methionine during translation, not all proteins retain methionine at their start in their final form.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
