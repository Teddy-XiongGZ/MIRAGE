    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what pembrolizumab is. From the documents, I can see that it is an immunotherapy drug, specifically an anti-PD-1 antibody. Now, I need to find information about its effectiveness against Ewing's sarcoma. Document [0] mentions that one patient with Ewing sarcoma had a sustained complete response to therapy with pembrolizumab. However, Document [4] states that none of the 13 patients with Ewing's sarcoma had an objective response to pembrolizumab. Document [31] describes a case where a patient with recurrent metastatic Ewing's sarcoma achieved a clinical and radiological remission with PD-1 blockade, which includes pembrolizumab. The evidence seems mixed, but there are cases where pembrolizumab has shown effectiveness against Ewing's sarcoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
