    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if \u03b1CGRP is a member of the CGRP family. Document [31] clearly states that CGRP consists of 37 amino acids and exists in two forms termed \u03b1-CGRP and \u03b2-CGRP, which are derived from separate genes and differ by three amino acids but exhibit similar biological activity. This indicates that \u03b1CGRP is indeed a member of the CGRP family.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
