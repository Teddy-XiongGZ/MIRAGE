    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the difference between whole-genome duplications and small-scale duplications. Whole-genome duplications involve the duplication of the entire genome, while small-scale duplications involve the duplication of individual genes or genomic segments. Next, I need to find information in the documents that compares the divergence of these two types of duplications in yeast. Document [19] states that whole-genome duplicates (WGDs) and small-scale duplicates (SSDs) in yeast have different evolutionary and genomic properties. It mentions that human WGDs are functionally less similar, diverge more in subcellular level and contain a higher proportion of essential genes than the SSDs. Document [7] also supports this by stating that WGD paralogs generally have similar compensatory functions but diverging expression patterns, suggesting a potential of distinct evolutionary scenarios for paralogs that arose through different duplication mechanisms. Therefore, it seems that whole-genome duplications are more divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
