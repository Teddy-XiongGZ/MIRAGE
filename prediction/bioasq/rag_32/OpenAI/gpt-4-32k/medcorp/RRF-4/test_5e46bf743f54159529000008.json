    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that foodstuffs can contain large quantities of stimulants of TLR2 and TLR4, which may regulate their capacity to stimulate inflammatory signalling. Document [7] also mentions that stimulants of TLR2 and TLR4 are found in minimally processed vegetables. Document [11] further supports this by stating that meat products stored at certain conditions can accumulate TLR2 and TLR4 stimulants. Therefore, it can be concluded that toll-like receptor 2 activators have been found in food.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
