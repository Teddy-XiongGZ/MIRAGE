    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cytokeratins are proteins found in the intracytoplasmic cytoskeleton of epithelial tissue. They are an important component of intermediate filaments, which help cells resist mechanical stress. Expression of these cytokeratins within epithelial cells is largely specific to particular organs or tissues. Thus they are used clinically to identify the cell of origin of various human tumors. Cytokeratins are released into necrotic areas and can be found intratumorally and in blood, circulating as partially degraded complexes, and can as such be used as tumor markers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
