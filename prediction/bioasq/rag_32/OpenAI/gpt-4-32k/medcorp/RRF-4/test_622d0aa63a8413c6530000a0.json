    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that a major function of Tousled-like kinases (TLKs) is to phosphorylate the histone chaperone proteins ASF1a and ASF1b. Document [1] also reports that human Asf1 proteins are phosphorylated by Tousled-like kinases both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, it is clear that ASF1 is phosphorylated by the Tousled-like kinases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
