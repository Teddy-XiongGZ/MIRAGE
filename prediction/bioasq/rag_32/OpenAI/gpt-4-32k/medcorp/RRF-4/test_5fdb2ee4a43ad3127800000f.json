    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that lamina-associated regions, which are typically localized at the nuclear periphery, displayed higher somatic mutation frequencies than did the interlamina regions at the nuclear core. Document [1] also suggests that there is an excess of damage detected in the nuclear interior, which could lead to mutations. However, it concludes that chromatin at the periphery of the human nucleus is not able to protect more internally located sequences from damage and mutation. Document [2] mentions that the change in somatic mutational load in cancer genomes is co-localized with topologically-associating-domain boundaries, which could be located at the nuclear periphery. Document [3] states that the most gene-rich chromosomes concentrate at the centre of the nucleus, whereas the more gene-poor chromosomes are located towards the nuclear periphery. This could suggest that mutations are more likely to occur in gene-poor regions, which are located towards the nuclear periphery. Based on these documents, it seems that somatic mutations are indeed positioned towards the nuclear periphery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
