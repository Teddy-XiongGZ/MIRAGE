    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several computational methods and tools that have been developed to predict Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). For instance, Document [0] mentions OPAL+, a novel MoRF predictor. Document [1] talks about a method that achieved comparable performance to the benchmarked OPAL predictor. Document [4] introduces a method using hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles to identify MoRFs in IDPs. Document [15] introduces MoRFpred, a computational tool for sequence-based prediction of MoRFs. Document [26] introduces MoRFCHiBi, a new computational approach for fast and accurate prediction of MoRFs in protein sequences. Therefore, it is clear that MoRFs in IDPs can be predicted computationally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
