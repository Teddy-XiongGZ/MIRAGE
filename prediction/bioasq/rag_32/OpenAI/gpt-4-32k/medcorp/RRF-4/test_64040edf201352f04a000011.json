    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] describes a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low-dose pioglitazone to delay onset of mild cognitive impairment in at-risk participants. The results showed that pioglitazone did not delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment. Document [18] also reports that pioglitazone as a second-line treatment after metformin might provide a protective effect on dementia risk among individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, the study was conducted on patients with diabetes, not on individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Document [10] also suggests that pioglitazone treatment decreases cerebral glucose utilisation in vivo, which contradicts the hypothesis that pioglitazone could act as a metabolic enhancer in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, based on the available clinical trial data, it seems that pioglitazone does not delay cognitive impairment for people at risk for Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
