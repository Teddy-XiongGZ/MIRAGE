    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypofractionated radiotherapy is a treatment method where larger doses of radiation are given over a shorter period. From the documents, it is clear that hypofractionated radiotherapy has been used in the treatment of DIPG. However, the results seem to be mixed. Some documents suggest that hypofractionated radiotherapy is well tolerated and feasible, and could represent a short-duration alternative to more protracted regimens. However, other documents suggest that this regimen does not seem to change overall survival in this setting. Therefore, while hypofractionated radiotherapy may offer some benefits in terms of tolerability and feasibility, it does not appear to offer significant benefits in terms of survival.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
