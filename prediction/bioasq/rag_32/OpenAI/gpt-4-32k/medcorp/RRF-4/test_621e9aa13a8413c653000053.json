    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that cohesin mutations represent a novel genetic pathway for AML. Document [1] states that mutations in the cohesin complex have been identified in up to 20% of AML cases. Document [2] also mentions that cohesin mutations are found in different tumors such as AML. Document [3] discusses that cohesin mutations promote resistance to inflammatory signals, and may provide a selective advantage for AML progression. Document [4] suggests that mutations in the cohesin complex may contribute to leukemogenesis. All these documents provide evidence that cohesin mutations play a role in AML.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
