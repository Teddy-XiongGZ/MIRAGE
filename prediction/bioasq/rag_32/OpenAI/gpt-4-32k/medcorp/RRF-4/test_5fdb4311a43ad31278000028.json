    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancers are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with gene promoters.

This suggests that enhancers are not directional in their targeting of gene promoters. They can interact with their target promoters regardless of their orientation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
