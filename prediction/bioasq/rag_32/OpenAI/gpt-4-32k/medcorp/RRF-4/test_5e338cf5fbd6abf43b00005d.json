    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents mention an increase in breast cancer incidence among Chernobyl survivors. Document [0] mentions a small increase in the incidence of premenopausal breast cancer in the most contaminated districts. Document [1] suggests that the incidence of breast cancer in Chernobyl-disaster-exposed women could be higher than previously thought. Document [3] suggests that prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation at low dose rates can increase the risk of breast cancer. Document [16] found a significantly increased risk of breast cancer among women residing in contaminated areas of Belarus who were lactating at the time of the accident. Document [22] found a significant 2-fold increase in risk during the period 1997-2001, in the most contaminated districts. These findings suggest that Chernobyl survivors are at an increased risk for breast cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
