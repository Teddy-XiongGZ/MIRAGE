    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 shows that rhamnose has a potentially beneficial effect on skin aging. Document 1 suggests that rhamnose-rich polysaccharides can protect against cytotoxic effects associated with aging. Document 2 discusses the role of rhamnose in cell and tissue aging. Document 3 also mentions the capacity of rhamnose-rich oligo- and polysaccharides to counteract several mechanisms involved in skin aging. Document 4 shows that rhamnose-rich oligo- and polysaccharides stimulate collagen biosynthesis, which is important for skin health and aging. Document 7 shows that rhamnose-rich oligo- and polysaccharides can upregulate collagen deposition, which is beneficial for skin health and aging. Document 9 shows that rhamnose-rich oligo- and polysaccharides can protect against aging-induced increase of certain cells. Document 13 shows that rhamnose contributes to the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, which have antioxidant properties and could potentially have anti-aging effects. Document 21 shows that rhamnose is involved in the decoration of various specialized metabolites, which could potentially have effects on aging. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that rhamnose does have an effect on aging.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
