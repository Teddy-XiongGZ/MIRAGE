    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the effectiveness of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Document [1] also supports this by stating that ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg may be equally effective to alleviate migraine.
