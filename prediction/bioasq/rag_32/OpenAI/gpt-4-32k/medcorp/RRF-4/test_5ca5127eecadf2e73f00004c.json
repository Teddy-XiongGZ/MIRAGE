    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Many documents mention changes in the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage in the context of disease. For instance, Document [1] mentions that the matrix of articular cartilage undergoes degenerative changes in osteoarthritis. Document [2] also mentions changes in the thickness of collagen fibers at the onset of osteoarthritis. Document [3] mentions that collagen becomes disorganized in osteoarthritis. Document [14] talks about the degradation and loss of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis, which involves biochemical and structural alterations in the extracellular matrix macromolecules. Document [26] also mentions that ongoing cartilage matrix destruction takes place in osteoarthritis, leading to a progressive loss in joint function. All these documents suggest that the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage does change with disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
