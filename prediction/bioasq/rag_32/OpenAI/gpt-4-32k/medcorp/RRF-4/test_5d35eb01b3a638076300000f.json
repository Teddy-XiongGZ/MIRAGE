    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided discuss the function of enhancers in gene transcription. They mention that enhancers can stimulate gene activity, increase the probability or rate of transcription, and facilitate the loading of the RNA polymerase complex. However, none of the documents mention the existence of negative enhancers, which would presumably inhibit or decrease gene transcription. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that there are no negative enhancers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
