    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that the introduction of rotavirus vaccines has been associated with changes in the distribution and prevalence of rotavirus genotypes. For instance, Document [0] mentions the emergence of G2 and G3 in Brazil and United States, respectively, post-vaccination introduction. Document [1] also notes an increase in the prevalence of the G2 genotype after vaccine introduction in Belgium. Document [2] mentions the transient predominance of heterotypic strains in countries using RV1. Document [4] reports an increased prevalence of G3P [8] strains in the first rotavirus season with reasonable rotavirus vaccine coverage. Document [6] suggests that different vaccines may exert different immune pressures, potentially influencing the prevalence of different genotypes. Document [13] suggests that both natural and vaccine-derived immunity can influence the distribution of rotavirus genotypes. Document [17] reports an increase in the G2P[4] genotype after vaccine introduction in Korea. Document [19] notes an increase in diversity and differences in genotype dominance in Australia after the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. Document [27] also reports an increase in certain genotypes after vaccine introduction in Japan. Document [29] mentions a decrease in the G2P[4] genotype and an increase in other genotypes after vaccine introduction in Brazil. Document [30] also suggests that vaccines may have selected heterotypic strains. Therefore, the evidence suggests that the introduction of rotavirus vaccines has been associated with changes in the predominant rotavirus genotypes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
