    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) is a functional scale specifically designed for ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). According to the documents, the NSAA scores progressively increased with age in DMD boys, and both the use of corticosteroids and the site of mutation significantly contributed to the NSAA changes. The NSAA can be reliably used at least from the age of 4 years. The NSAA is a test that can be easily performed, completed in 10 minutes and can be used in a multicentric setting, providing that adequate training is administered. The NSAA had a moderate to good correlation with 6-minute walk test and with timed rising from floor but less with 10 m timed walk/run test. The NSAA is a reliable and valid instrument to measure functional capacity in boys with DMD. The NSAA is a psychometrically robust scale for use in DMD clinical research and trials. The NSAA is a reliable measure that can track the progression of DMD and represent a valuable tool for follow-up and clinical studies. The NSAA is a test that can be easily performed and can be used in a multicentric setting, providing that adequate training is administered.
