    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and blocks signaling of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, as stated in Document [0]. This is further confirmed by Document [1] which states that Tocilizumab competitively inhibits the binding of interleukin-6 (IL-6) to its receptor (IL-6R). Therefore, Tocilizumab is used to block/antagonize the IL-6 receptor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
