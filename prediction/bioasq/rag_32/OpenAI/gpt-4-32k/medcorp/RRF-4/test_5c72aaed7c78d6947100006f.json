    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] shows that a phase II study evaluated the antitumor activity of pazopanib in patients with malignant glioma. However, the antitumor activity of this combination at the phase II dose tested was limited. Document [1] also shows that pazopanib did not prolong progression-free survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Document [2] does not provide any evidence that pazopanib is effective in treating glioblastoma. Document [22] shows that bevacizumab retains modest activity in high-grade glioma patients who progress on pazopanib. Document [29] also suggests that pazopanib provides modest benefit overall to nonadipocytic soft tissue sarcoma patients, but we have yet to identify the molecular basis for those patients who derive exceptional benefit. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that pazopanib is not an effective treatment for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
