    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that HDAC1/2 can directly bind and deacetylate GATA-1. Document [15] mentions that during erythropoiesis, histone deacetylase activity is dramatically reduced and this reduction of HDAC activity promotes erythroid differentiation. Document [17] states that acetylated GATA-1 is required for chromatin occupancy. Document [23] mentions that GATA-1 and NF-E2 are erythroid specific activators that bind to the \u03b2-globin locus and are required for \u03b3-globin transcription. Document [27] states that CREB-binding protein (CBP) markedly stimulates GATA-1's transcriptional activity and GATA-1 and CBP also coimmunoprecipitate from nuclear extracts of erythroid cells. From these documents, it can be inferred that HDAC1 is required for GATA-1 transcriptional activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
