    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Golodirsen is a medication used for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) as stated in Document [0]. It works by inducing exon skipping in the dystrophin gene and thereby increasing the amount of dystrophin protein available to muscle fibers. Document [1] reports a clinical trial where golodirsen increased dystrophin protein and showed long-term safety in a declining DMD population. Document [3] also reports that golodirsen-treated patients showed increased exon 53 skipping, dystrophin production, and correct dystrophin sarcolemmal localization. However, Document [2] mentions that the clinical benefits of the drug are yet to be established and its efficacy is questioned. Despite these concerns, the FDA has approved golodirsen for the treatment of DMD as mentioned in Document [18]. Therefore, while there are some concerns about its efficacy, golodirsen has shown some effectiveness in the treatment of DMD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
