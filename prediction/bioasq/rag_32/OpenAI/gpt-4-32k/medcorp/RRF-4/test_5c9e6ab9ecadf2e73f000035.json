    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what FACS is. FACS stands for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting, a specialized type of flow cytometry. It provides a method for sorting a heterogeneous mixture of biological cells into two or more containers, one cell at a time, based upon the specific light scattering and fluorescent characteristics of each cell. Now, I need to find information in the documents that indicates whether exosomes can be analyzed with FACS. Document [0] mentions that the isolation of Tu-exosomes was confirmed by FACS analysis. Document [6] also mentions the use of FACS to detect human EGFR and CD9 on exosomes. Document [7] mentions the use of FACS to detect the FITC-conjugated Id-peptides on exosomes. Document [19] also mentions the use of FACS to analyze exosomes. Document [24] describes the workflow of immuno magnetic isolation and analysis of exosomes by flow cytometry, which includes FACS. Document [26] discusses the use of FACS to analyze exosomes. Document [27] also mentions the use of FACS to analyze exosomes. Therefore, it is clear that FACS can be used to analyze exosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
