    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mucins are described in multiple documents as glycosylated proteins. For instance, Document [0] mentions that mucin genes encode mucin monomers that are post-translationally modified by abundant glycosylation. Document [1] also describes mucins as a group of heavily O-glycosylated proteins. Therefore, it is clear that mucins are indeed glycosylated proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
