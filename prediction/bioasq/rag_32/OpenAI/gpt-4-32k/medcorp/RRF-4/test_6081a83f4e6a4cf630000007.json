    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FKBP52 is mentioned in several documents as a co-chaperone or as having chaperone-like activity. For example, Document [0] describes FKBP52 as having a chaperone-like activity in vitro. Document [1] refers to FKBP52 as an Hsp90-associated co-chaperone. Document [4] also mentions FKBP52's chaperone activity. Therefore, it can be concluded that FKBP52 does encode a chaperone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
