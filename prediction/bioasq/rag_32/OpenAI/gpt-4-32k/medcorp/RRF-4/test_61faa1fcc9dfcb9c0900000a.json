    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what vocimagene amiretrorepvec is. From Document [1], I learned that it is an investigational treatment for recurrent high-grade glioma. The document also mentions that it showed improved survival rates in a phase 1 trial. Document [0] also supports this, stating that the treatment induced robust, durable responses. However, Document [2] contradicts this, stating that the treatment did not improve overall survival or other efficacy end points in a randomized clinical trial. This suggests that while the treatment may have shown promise in early trials, it may not be as effective in larger, more rigorous studies. Therefore, the evidence is mixed and it's hard to definitively say whether vocimagene amiretrorepvec is effective for recurrent high-grade glioma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
