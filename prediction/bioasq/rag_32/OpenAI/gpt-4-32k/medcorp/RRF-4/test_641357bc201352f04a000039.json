    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is distinct from apoptosis. According to Document [0], necrotic cell death, which includes necroptosis, culminates in leakage of cell contents into the extracellular space, which implies disruption of the cell membrane. This is further supported by Document [1], which states that necroptosis involves plasma membrane rupture. Document [7] also mentions that during necroptosis, the cell membrane is permeabilized, leading to expulsion of cellular contents into the extracellular space. Therefore, it is clear that cells undergoing necroptosis do show disruption of their cell membranes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
