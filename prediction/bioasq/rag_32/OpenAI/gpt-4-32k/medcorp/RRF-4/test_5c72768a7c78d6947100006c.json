    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that dose-dependent overexpression of X-linked genes that normally 'escape' X inactivation may account for the mental and developmental delay. Document [2] mentions that there is an excess of escaping genes associated with mental retardation. Document [3] suggests that genes that escape X-inactivation may produce their gene products in excess, influencing normal brain growth and differentiation. Document [14] suggests that the X chromosome contains a significantly higher number of genes that, when mutated, cause mental impairment. Document [16] mentions that the X chromosome has accumulated a disproportionate number of genes concerned with mental functions. Document [23] suggests that the cognitive deficit in a significant percentage of patients with unexplained mental retardation results from epigenetic modifications. Document [26] suggests that the degree of impairment in IQ depended on the size of the active ring, and hence was proportionate to the number of (as yet unidentified) genes whose functional disomy affected brain development and functioning. All these documents suggest that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation are related to mental impairment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
