    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide different perspectives on the functional fraction of the human genome. Document [0] suggests that there is an upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome, which cannot exceed 25% due to mutational load considerations. However, Document [1] argues that the functional fraction is not likely to be substantially limited by mutational load. Document [9] suggests that much more than 5% of the genome encodes functional information, and the upper bound may be considerably higher than currently thought. Document [15] also suggests that the biochemically active regions cover a much larger fraction of the genome than do evolutionarily conserved regions, raising the question of whether nonconserved but biochemically active regions are truly functional. Therefore, while there are arguments for an upper limit, there are also arguments against it, suggesting that the question is still a matter of ongoing research and debate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
