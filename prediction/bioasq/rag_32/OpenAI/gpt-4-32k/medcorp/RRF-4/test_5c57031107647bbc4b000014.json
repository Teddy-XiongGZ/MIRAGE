    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme in glycolysis and has been reported to have multiple functions in several bacteria. According to Document [0], GAPDH in Mycoplasma hyorhinis was reported to function as a plasminogen receptor. Document [1] also mentions that GAPDH in enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli binds to human plasminogen. Document [2] also reports that GAPDH in Pasteurella multocida acts as a plasminogen receptor. Therefore, it can be concluded that GAPDH has been reported to be a plasminogen receptor in pathogenic bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
