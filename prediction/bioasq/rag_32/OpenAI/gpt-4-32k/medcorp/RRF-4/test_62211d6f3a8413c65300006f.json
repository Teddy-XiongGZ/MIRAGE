    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RNase R is an enzyme that degrades linear RNAs. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNA that form a covalently closed continuous loop. Due to their circular structure, they are not easily degraded by exonuclease RNase R, making them more stable than linear RNAs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
