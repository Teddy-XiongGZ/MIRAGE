    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic is. According to Document [0], MAGE-A3 is an antigen-specific cancer immunotherapeutic agent used to prevent cancer relapse in patients with MAGE-A3-positive stages of non-small-cell lung cancer. Now, I need to find evidence about its effectiveness. Document [1] states that adjuvant treatment with the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic did not increase disease-free survival compared with placebo in patients with MAGE-A3-positive surgically resected NSCLC. This suggests that MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic may not be effective for non-small-cell lung cancer. This conclusion is supported by Document [2], which states that no statistically significant improvement in disease-free interval, disease-free survival, or overall survival was observed with the use of MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
