    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] shows that the median event-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with valproic acid were 9.5 and 13.4 months respectively, which were statistically significantly superior to those not treated with valproic acid. Document [1] also shows that valproic acid was well tolerated in pediatric patients with high-grade glioma or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and the moderate tumor efficacy encourages studying the drug further. Document [18] shows that addition of valproic acid and bevacizumab to radiation was well tolerated but did not appear to improve event-free survival or overall survival in children with DIPG or high-grade glioma. Document [21] shows that valproic acid plus radiochemotherapy is well tolerated with an encouraging response rate. Document [26] shows that valproic acid may have potentiated the antiangiogenic effect of vincristine, diminished expression of resistance to carboplatin, and sensitized tumor cells to radiotherapy. Document [19] shows that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to valproic acid administration. However, the results are inconsistent and further randomized controlled trials are needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
