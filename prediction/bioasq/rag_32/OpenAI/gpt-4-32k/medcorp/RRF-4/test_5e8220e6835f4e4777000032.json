    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protoporphyrinogen oxidase is an enzyme involved in heme metabolism. According to Document [0], this enzyme is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Document [1] also supports this, stating that protoporphyrinogen oxidase was found to be closely associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Document [2] also mentions that one of the protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase enzymes is targeted to mitochondria. Therefore, it is clear that Protoporphyrinogen oxidase is localized to the mitochondrium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
