    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the use of enlimomab after ischemic stroke resulted in worse outcomes for patients compared to placebo, with more patients experiencing symptom-free recovery on placebo than enlimomab, and more patients dying in the enlimomab group. Document [1] also mentions serious adverse events in patients treated with enlimomab, including pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest. Document [2] also mentions that the case fatality rate in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial was significantly higher in the enlimomab patient group than in the placebo group. Document [5] suggests that the administration of enlimomab in acute ischemic stroke may lead to clinical deterioration. These documents provide strong evidence that enlimomab does not improve stroke outcomes, and may in fact worsen them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
