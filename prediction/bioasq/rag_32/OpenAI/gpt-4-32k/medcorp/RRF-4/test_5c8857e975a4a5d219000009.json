    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that apoE mimetics have been used in models to improve behavior and reduce inflammation and pathology in Alzheimer's disease. Document [1] also supports this, stating that treatment with an apoE mimetic in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease resulted in a reduction in pathology and improved behavioral outcomes. Document [2] further supports this, showing that treatment with an apoE mimetic reduced neuroinflammation and protected against impaired neurogenesis in transgenic mice. Therefore, it is clear that apoE mimetics are being considered as a treatment against Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
