    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that daprodustat was efficacious and well tolerated for anemia in both NDD and DD patients in the short term based on current RCTs. Document 1 also mentions that the safety of daprodustat was comparable to ESA in this pooled analysis. Document 2 shows that daprodustat has similar efficacy compared to rhEPO for the treatment of anemia of CKD. Document 4 also supports that daprodustat could improve hemoglobin without increasing adverse events in the short term. Document 5 mentions that daprodustat was non-inferior to ESAs in increasing hemoglobin. Document 7 shows that higher daprodustat doses were associated with a higher impact on efficacy outcomes as serum total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), hemoglobin, and ferritin. Document 8 also supports that oral daprodustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa as measured by mean hemoglobin over weeks 40-52 in Japanese patients receiving hemodialysis switched from ESAs. Document 14 shows that daprodustat produced dose-dependent changes in hemoglobin over the first 4 weeks after switching from a stable dose of rhEPO as well as maintained hemoglobin target levels over 24 weeks. Document 16 shows that daprodustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa in achieving and maintaining target hemoglobin levels in Japanese ND patients. Document 18 shows that daprodustat effectively maintained target hemoglobin over 24 weeks in CKD patients with anemia who were rhEPO naive or had switched from existing rhEPO therapy. Document 20 shows that daprodustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa in achieving and maintaining target hemoglobin levels in Japanese ND patients. Document 24 shows that daprodustat increased hemoglobin concentrations within the target range in 29% of chronic rhEPO-hyporesponsive subjects. Document 27 shows that daprodustat was noninferior to CERA in achieving and maintaining target hemoglobin levels in Japanese ND patients. Document 29 shows that daprodustat increased hemoglobin concentrations within the target range in 29% of chronic rhEPO-hyporesponsive subjects. All these documents support that Daprodustat is effective for anemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
