    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Many documents mention the potential of gene therapy in restoring auditory function. For instance, Document [1] demonstrates recovery of gene and protein expression, restoration of sensory cell function, rescue of complex auditory function and recovery of hearing and balance behavior to near wild-type levels. Document [3] reports restoration of function in inner and outer hair cells, enhanced hair cell survival, restoration of cochlear and vestibular function, restoration of neural responses in auditory cortex and recovery of behavioral responses to auditory and vestibular stimulation. Document [14] indicates that auditory function was successfully restored, and the hearing threshold remained stable for at least 12 weeks after rescue. Therefore, it can be concluded that gene therapy can restore auditory function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
