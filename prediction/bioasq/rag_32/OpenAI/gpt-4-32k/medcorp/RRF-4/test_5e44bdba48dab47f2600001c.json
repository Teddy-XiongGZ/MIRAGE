    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] reports that selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, showed activity in recurrent, refractory, or progressive pilocytic astrocytoma harbouring common BRAF aberrations and NF1-associated paediatric low-grade glioma. Document [2] also mentions that selumetinib has anticancer effects on low-grade glioma cell lines. Document [3] reports that selumetinib was tolerable and led to responses and prolonged disease stability in children with recurrent/progressive OPHGs. Document [4] mentions that MEK inhibitors have demonstrated promising responses in some pediatric tumors (eg, low-grade glioma). Document [16] reports that selumetinib has promising antitumor activity in children with LGG. Document [18] mentions that ADC histogram metrics are associated with progression-free survival and response to treatment with selumetinib in pediatric low-grade gliomas. Document [22] reports that selumetinib is a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target of glioma. Document [25] reports that selumetinib has promising antitumor activity in children with LGG. All these documents suggest that selumetinib is effective for low-grade glioma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
