    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that cabozantinib is effective for hepatocellular carcinoma. Document [0] mentions that cabozantinib is a strong multi-inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases approved for renal cell carcinoma that could be useful also for the treatment of HCC. Document [1] states that cabozantinib has demonstrated an improved overall survival and progression-free survival in the phase 3 CELESTIAL study in second and third line, in patients in good general condition and with a normal liver function Child-Pugh class A. Document [2] also mentions that the phase III CELESTIAL trial demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement in overall survival with cabozantinib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with sorafenib. Therefore, the answer is yes, cabozantinib is effective for hepatocellular carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
