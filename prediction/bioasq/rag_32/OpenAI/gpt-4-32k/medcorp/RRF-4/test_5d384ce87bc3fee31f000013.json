    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GRHL2 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the epithelial phenotype of cancers. Document [0] states that over-expression of GRHL2 is sufficient to induce epithelial gene expression. Document [1] suggests that knockdown of GRHL2 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Document [2] also highlights that high GRHL2 expression is correlated with worse relapse-free survival in all four subtypes of breast cancer. Document [11] states that GRHL2 suppresses EMT. Document [26] suggests that GRHL2 regulates epithelial plasticity along with stemness in PDAC, both of which are crucial for metastasis. Document [30] states that GRHL2 enhances the expression of ICAM-1, augmenting NK-target cell synaptogenesis and NK killing of target cells. All these documents suggest that over-expression of GRHL2 leads to an epithelial phenotype, not EMT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
