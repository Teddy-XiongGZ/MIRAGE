    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epigenetic changes refer to modifications in gene expression that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. This is mentioned in multiple documents, such as Document [0], Document [1], Document [2], and Document [3]. These changes can include DNA methylation and histone modification, which alter how genes are expressed without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Therefore, epigenetic changes do not change the DNA sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
