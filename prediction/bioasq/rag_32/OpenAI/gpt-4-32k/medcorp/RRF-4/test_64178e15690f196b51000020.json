    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Casimersen is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping, as stated in Document [0]. Document [1] also mentions that casimersen was well tolerated in participants with DMD amenable to exon 45 skipping, and most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild, nonserious, and unrelated to casimersen. Document [2] also mentions that casimersen targets exon 45 of the dystrophin gene and is expected to treat ~8% of the DMD patient population. Therefore, it can be concluded that casimersen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
