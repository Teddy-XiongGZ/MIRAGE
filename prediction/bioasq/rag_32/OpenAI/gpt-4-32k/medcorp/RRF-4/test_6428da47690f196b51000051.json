    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that epigenetic differences can predict significant expression differences. Document [1] supports the idea that the first intron sites of genes may have important regulatory functions in gene expression. Document [2] shows that the length of the first exon, which is part of the intron-exon structure, can predict gene activity. Document [4] suggests that the first intron of genes exhibits the highest density of regulatory chromatin marks, which are epigenetic modifications. Document [5] suggests that first introns are enriched for active transcriptional regulatory signals. Document [10] discusses the interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and splicing regulation. Document [14] discusses the impact of the first intron on determining the transcription start site and elongation of its own expression. Document [24] reveals an inverse association between the methylation level of the first intron, an epigenetic modification, and gene expression. Document [28] shows that intronic heterochromatin, an epigenetic modification, can regulate gene transcription. Document [29] summarizes recent progress in understanding how introns and the act of their removal by the spliceosome can influence and enhance almost every step of mRNA metabolism, which is a part of gene expression. All these documents provide evidence that the epigenetic status of introns can affect gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
