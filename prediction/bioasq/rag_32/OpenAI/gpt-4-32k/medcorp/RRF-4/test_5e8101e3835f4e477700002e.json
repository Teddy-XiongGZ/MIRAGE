    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that cathepsin L is active in endosomes. Document [2] also mentions that cathepsin D is in endosomes of macrophages. Document [4] mentions that upregulated procathepsin L is targeted to endosomes. Document [5] mentions that cathepsin L can be active in endolysosomes. Document [7] mentions that endosomes contain significant levels of proteases like cathepsins. Document [17] mentions that cathepsin L is active in endosomes. Document [20] mentions that cathepsin L is active in endosomes. Document [25] mentions that cathepsin L is active in endosomes. Document [30] mentions that procathepsin L is processed to the mature form after its arrival in lysosomes by some cysteine proteinase other than cathepsin B. This suggests that cathepsin L could be active in endosomes before it is processed in lysosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
