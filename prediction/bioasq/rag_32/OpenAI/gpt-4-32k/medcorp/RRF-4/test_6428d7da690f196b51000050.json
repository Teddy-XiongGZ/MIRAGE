    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The untranslated regions of mRNAs, as mentioned in Document [1], can determine gene expression by influencing mRNA stability and translational efficiency. Document [2] also mentions that the 3\u2032-UTR can contain sequences that contribute to translation regulation. Document [3] states that the 3\u2032-UTR often contains regulatory regions that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. Document [5] also mentions that several roles in gene expression have been attributed to the untranslated regions, including mRNA stability, mRNA localization, and translational efficiency. Therefore, it is clear that untranslated regions (UTRs) can regulate gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
