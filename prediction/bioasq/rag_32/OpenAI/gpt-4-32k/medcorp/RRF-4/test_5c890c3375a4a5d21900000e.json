    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents mention that oleuropein aglycone can interfere with amyloid aggregation. For example, Document [0] states that oleuropein aglycone hinders amyloid aggregation of A\u03b2(1-42) and its cytotoxicity. Document [1] also mentions that Oleuropein aglycone interferes in vitro and in vivo with amyloid aggregation of a number of proteins/peptides involved in amyloid diseases. Document [2] also supports this by stating that Oleuropein aglycone prevents the growth of toxic A\u03b2<sub1-42</sub oligomers and blocks their successive growth into mature fibrils. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
