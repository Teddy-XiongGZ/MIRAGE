    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that LY6K overexpression was associated with poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC. Document [1] also mentions that LY6K is related to tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and TNM staging in NSCLC patients. Document [10] also confirms that LY6K-positive group had a significantly worse overall survival. Therefore, overexpression of LY6K is not associated with better prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
