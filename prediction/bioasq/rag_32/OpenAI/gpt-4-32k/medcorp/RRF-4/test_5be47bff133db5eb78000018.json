    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that pet keeping influences the infant gut microbiome. Document [2] states that early-life exposure to household pets has the capacity to reduce risk for overweight and allergic disease, especially following caesarean delivery, and that pets also alter the gut microbial composition of infants. Document [3] suggests that perinatal exposure to pets and compositional changes in the gut microbiota are interrelated among urban infants. Document [5] provides new evidence that exposure to pets may influence the early development of the gut microbiota. Document [6] mentions that the presence of pets is one of the factors that influence the development of the infant microbiota. Document [8] states that the presence of siblings and pets are among the factors that influence the human microbiome. Document [10] mentions that household exposures such as siblings and furry pets represent important covariates. Document [13] states that the human microbiome is largely influenced during pregnancy, birth, and the neonatal period by factors such as the presence of pets. Document [26] suggests that the built environment, which includes the presence of pets, can be a source of exposure that influences the composition of the infant gut microbiome. Document [30] suggests that pets can modify the relationship between delivery mode and offspring body size, which could be related to the gut microbiome. All these documents provide evidence that pets can indeed affect the infant microbiome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
