    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents consistently mention that gamma-H2AX, or phosphorylated H2AX, is a marker for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This is stated in documents such as [0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], and [31]. Therefore, the answer is yes, g-H2AX is a marker for double strand breaks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
