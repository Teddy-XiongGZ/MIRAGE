    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about the effect of Axitinib on the survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Document [0] and [1] indicate that Axitinib did not show evidence of improved survival rates over treatments using gemcitabine alone for advanced pancreatic cancer. Document [2] also states that the addition of Axitinib to gemcitabine does not improve overall survival in advanced pancreatic cancer. These documents provide strong evidence that Axitinib does not prolong survival of pancreatic cancer patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
