    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] directly addresses the question. It states that atemoya juice significantly inhibited CYP1A2 activity in human liver microsomes. However, preadministration of atemoya had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of phenacetin, a CYP1A2 substrate, in rats. This suggests that the intake of an excess amount of atemoya juice is necessary to cause a change in the pharmacokinetics of phenacetin when the IC<sub50</sub values for CYP1A2 inhibition by atemoya and fluvoxamine are taken into account. The results indicate that a daily intake of atemoya would not change the pharmacokinetics of CYP1A2 substrates such as phenacetin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
