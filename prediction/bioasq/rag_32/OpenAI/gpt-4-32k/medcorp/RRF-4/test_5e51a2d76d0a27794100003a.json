    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that a large number of human autosomal genes are subject to monoallelic expression (MAE) and that this contributes to high genetic variation across human populations. It also mentions that MAE genes exhibit an elevated recombination rate and an increased density of hypermutable sequence contexts, which contribute to the increased diversity. Therefore, it can be inferred that genes with monoallelic expression do contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
