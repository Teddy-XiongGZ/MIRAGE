    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that avelumab is being assessed in a phase II trial for its efficacy and safety in patients with non-metastatic muscle invasive bladder cancer. Document [1] states that avelumab has been approved by the FDA as maintenance therapy for metastatic urothelial cancer. Document [3] also mentions that avelumab was approved by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of urothelial carcinoma. Document [4] states that avelumab has been given FDA approval for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic urothelial carcinoma after failure of first-line chemotherapy. Document [9] mentions that patients treated with avelumab had significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than those who received best supportive care alone. Document [13] states that avelumab maintenance represents a new practice-changing treatment. Document [14] mentions that avelumab maintenance therapy was a cost-effective first-line treatment compared with best supportive care in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Document [20] states that avelumab first-line maintenance treatment showed a favorable benefit-risk balance in Japanese patients. Document [26] mentions that avelumab 1L maintenance is a new standard of care in Japanese patients with advanced UC that has not progressed with 1L platinum-containing chemotherapy. Document [28] states that avelumab 1L maintenance is also included as a standard of care in treatment guidelines for advanced UC with level 1 evidence. All these documents provide evidence that avelumab is effective for bladder cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
