    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] clearly states that TFII-I is implicated in the differentiation of erythro-megakaryocytic cells. Megakaryopoiesis is the process of differentiation of megakaryocytes, the large cells in the bone marrow that produce platelets for blood clotting. Therefore, if TFII-I is involved in the differentiation of these cells, it plays a role in megakaryopoiesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
