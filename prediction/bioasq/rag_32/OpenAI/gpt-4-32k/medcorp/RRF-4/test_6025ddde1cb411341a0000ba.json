    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the effectiveness of Tranexamic acid for intracerebral haemorrhage. Some studies suggest that Tranexamic acid can reduce haematoma growth and improve clinical outcomes after intracerebral haemorrhage. However, other studies report no significant difference in death or dependency, and some suggest that the time window for optimal effect of haemostatic therapy in intracerebral haemorrhage is yet to be established. Therefore, while Tranexamic acid shows promise as a haemostatic agent for intracerebral haemorrhage, more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
