    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several medications that have been studied for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. However, the results of these studies are mixed. Some studies found that hydroxychloroquine did not provide significant protection against COVID-19 following exposure, while others found that it did. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19. Therefore, while some medications have been studied for this purpose, none have been definitively proven to be effective and authorized for use as post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
