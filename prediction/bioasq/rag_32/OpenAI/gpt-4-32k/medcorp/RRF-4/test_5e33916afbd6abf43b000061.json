    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Most of the documents suggest that there is an increased risk of bladder cancer following radiotherapy for prostate cancer. For instance, Document [0] states that radiation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Document [1] also suggests that there is an increased risk of bladder cancer after external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Document [2] further confirms that men who receive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and compared to the general population. Document [4] also supports this by stating that patients who received radiotherapy for prostate cancer were associated with higher risks of developing secondary bladder cancer compared to those unexposed to radiotherapy. Therefore, the answer is yes, radiotherapy for prostate cancer does increase bladder cancer risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
