    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that \u03b1-taxilin expression is significantly associated with the proliferative activity of colorectal cancer (CRC), but its overexpression alone is not a biomarker of malignancy. Document [4] suggests that the expression of \u03b1-taxilin protein can be a marker of malignant potential of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Document [5] indicates that increased expression of alpha-taxilin protein in primary tumors was related to local invasion, pathological vessel invasion, and metastasis, suggesting that alpha-taxilin influences the metastatic and invasive potential of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Document [12] suggests that \u03b1-taxilin could be a potential biomarker for cisplatin sensitivity and invasive potential. From these documents, it can be inferred that taxilin can be considered as a cancer marker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
