    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several times that ATAC-seq can be used in single-cell mode. For example, Document [0] mentions modifications to the ATAC-seq protocol to accommodate single-cell analysis. Document [1] talks about single-cell ATAC-seq providing insight into cell-to-cell variability. Document [3] mentions that single cell ATAC-seq has been performed since 2015. Therefore, it is clear that ATAC-Seq can be employed in single-cell mode.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
