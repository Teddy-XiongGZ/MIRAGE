    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what vocimagene amiretrorepvec is. From Document [19], I learned that it is a gene therapy agent used in combination with a prodrug to treat brain cancers. Next, I need to find evidence of its effectiveness in treating glioblastoma. Document [0] mentions that patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations or second recurrence can benefit from vocimagene amiretrorepvec. Document [1] states that a clinical trial comparing vocimagene amiretrorepvec with standard of care did not show improved overall survival or other efficacy end points. However, Document [2] suggests that it may benefit patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Document [4] also mentions that overall survival for recurrent high-grade glioma was statistically improved with vocimagene amiretrorepvec. Document [7] reports durable complete responses in some recurrent high-grade glioma patients treated with vocimagene amiretrorepvec. Therefore, while the evidence is mixed, there are several documents that suggest vocimagene amiretrorepvec can be effective in treating glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
