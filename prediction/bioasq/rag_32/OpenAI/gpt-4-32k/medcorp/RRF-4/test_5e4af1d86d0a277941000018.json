    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided contain numerous studies and reviews that discuss the potential antitumor effects of metformin. These studies indicate that metformin, a common drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, may have antitumor properties. The mechanism of this antitumor action is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the activation of AMPK, a cellular metabolic sensor, and the inhibition of mTOR, a downstream effector of growth factor signaling. However, the effects of metformin in nondiabetic patients remain unknown and further clinical trials are needed to confirm its antineoplastic activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
