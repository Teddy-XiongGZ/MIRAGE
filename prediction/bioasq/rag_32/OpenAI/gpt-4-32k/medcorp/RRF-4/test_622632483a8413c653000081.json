    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided contain multiple references to the role of immune regulation mechanisms in pregnancy and their disruption leading to adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia. For instance, Document [0] mentions that innate immune disturbances may be responsible for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia. Document [1] discusses how in preeclampsia, the regulation of immune responses is disrupted. Document [2] reveals changes within the maternal immune system in both PE and postpartum PE. Document [3] discusses the imbalance in the subpopulations of CD4+ T cells and a role for these cells as mediators of inflammation and hypertension during pregnancy. Document [4] discusses how an immune imbalance leads to chronic inflammation and ensuing oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines, and autoantibodies. Document [24] discusses the role of the immune system including both innate and adaptive immunity and sheds light on their role in PE. Therefore, it is clear that disruption of immune regulation mechanisms is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
