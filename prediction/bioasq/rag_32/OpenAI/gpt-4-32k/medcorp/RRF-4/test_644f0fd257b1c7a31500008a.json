    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enhancers are known to regulate the expression of genes. According to the documents, enhancers can be separated from their target genes by large distances and are thus known as distal regulatory elements. They control the temporal and spatial activity of genes in an orientation-independent manner. They can interact with their target promoters through looping interactions which must act over a certain distance. Therefore, enhancers do not need to be close to their gene targets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
