    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide ample evidence that patient-derived organoids (PDOs) can recapitulate patient responses in the clinic. For instance, Document [4] suggests that PDOs can recapitulate patient responses in the clinic and could be implemented in personalized medicine programs. Document [13] also confirms that rectal cancer organoids closely recapitulate the pathophysiology and genetic changes of corresponding tumors, and their responses to chemoradiation in patients are highly matched to RCO responses. Document [20] also supports the idea that PDOs can predict LARC patient responses in the clinic and may represent a companion diagnostic tool in rectal cancer treatment. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
