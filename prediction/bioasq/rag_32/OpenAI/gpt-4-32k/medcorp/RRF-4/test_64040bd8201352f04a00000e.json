    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document mentions a study that aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of bexarotene in promoting remyelination in people with multiple sclerosis. The results showed that participants who received bexarotene had a higher mean number of adverse events than those who received a placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was not different between the bexarotene group and the placebo group. The document concludes by stating that the use of bexarotene to treat patients with multiple sclerosis is not recommended due to its poor tolerability and negative primary efficacy outcome. Therefore, based on this information, bexarotene should not be used for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
