    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [3] states that the locations of chromatin loops in Drosophila were found most often in association with the polycomb group (PcG) protein Polycomb (Pc), a subunit of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). This suggests that PcG proteins are involved in the formation of chromatin loops. Document [8] also mentions that loops can occur between discrete elements that have PcG proteins bound to them, further supporting the idea that PcG proteins mediate the formation of chromatin loops.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
