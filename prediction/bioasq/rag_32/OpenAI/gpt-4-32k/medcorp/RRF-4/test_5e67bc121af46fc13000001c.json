    "The documents suggest that Spinal Intradural Primary Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are not rare in neurofibromatosis patients. For instance, Document [2] mentions that MPNSTs in children are extremely rare, but it also states that the case they are discussing involves a child with neurofibromatosis type 2. Document [8] also mentions that individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 have a significantly increased risk of MPNSTs. Document [24] also states that MPNSTs are common in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Therefore, the answer is no, Spinal Intradural Primary Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors are not rare in neurofibromatosis patients. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that Spinal Intradural Primary Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are not rare in neurofibromatosis patients.
