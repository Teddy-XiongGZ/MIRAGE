    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what major brain gangliosides are. From the documents, I learned that gangliosides are glycosphingolipids highly abundant in the nervous system, and they play important roles in the modulation of membrane proteins and ion channels, in cell signaling and in the communication among cells. Changes in the ganglioside profile were reported in common neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. Then, I need to find out if they are a target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. From the documents, I found that gangliosides are altered in Alzheimer's disease and might be important for better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. There are also studies suggesting that targeting ganglioside metabolism might represent an underexploited opportunity to design novel therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that major brain gangliosides are a target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
