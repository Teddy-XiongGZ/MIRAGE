    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided contain multiple references to resistance training leading to muscle hypertrophy. For example, Document [0] discusses the impact of resistance training frequency on hypertrophic adaptations, implying that resistance training does lead to muscle growth. Document [1] also discusses the role of resistance training in muscle growth. Document [2] mentions that resistance training is a strategy for improving muscle strength and hypertrophy. Document [3] talks about muscle hypertrophy as a result of chronic resistance training. Therefore, it can be concluded that resistance training is usually associated with increasing muscle hypertrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
