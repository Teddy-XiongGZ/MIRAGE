    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information about the formation and characteristics of circular exons, but they do not directly address whether circular exons increase gene expression. However, Document 16 suggests that circular RNAs, which can be formed from exons, can result in increased protein production, which is a form of gene expression. Document 19 also suggests that circular RNAs can affect molecular and physiological phenotypes, which could potentially include gene expression. However, these documents do not provide a definitive answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
