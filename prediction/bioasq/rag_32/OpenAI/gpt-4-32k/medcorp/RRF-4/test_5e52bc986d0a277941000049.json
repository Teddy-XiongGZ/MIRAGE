    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 mentions that the CADM2 polymorphism showed evidence of association with information processing speed. Document 1 also suggests that genetic variation in the CADM2 gene is associated with individual differences in information processing speed. Document 13 also mentions that CADM2 contributes to mechanisms shared between mental and physical health disorders, which could potentially include information processing speed. Therefore, it seems that the CADM2 gene is associated with differences in information processing speed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
