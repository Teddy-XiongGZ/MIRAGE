    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Super-enhancers are clusters of active enhancers that coordinate cell-type specific gene regulation. They are associated with highly expressed genes and play a crucial role in gene regulation and disease progression. According to the documents, super-enhancers can physically contact with their target promoters by chromatin looping during transcription. This suggests that super-enhancers are indeed structurally insulated in chromatin loops. Document [16] also supports this by stating that super-enhancers insulated by strong TAD boundaries may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis. Therefore, the answer is yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
