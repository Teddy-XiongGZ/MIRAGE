    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] shows that tirabrutinib was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy for B-cell NHL/CLL. Document [1] suggests that tirabrutinib might have a more favourable toxicity profile compared to ibrutinib and could be a viable treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Document [2] mentions that tirabrutinib has demonstrated effective in vitro cytotoxicity in many types of B-cell malignancies. Document [3] states that tirabrutinib was approved in March 2020 in Japan for the treatment of recurrent or refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma. Document [6] indicates favorable efficacy of tirabrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma. Document [7] mentions that tirabrutinib was approved in Japan for the treatment of recurrent or refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma. Document [8] reports that five cases of refractory/relapsed primary central nervous system lymphoma were successfully treated by tirabrutinib. Document [13] shows that tirabrutinib in combination with idelalisib or entospletinib was well tolerated in patients with CLL, establishing an acceptable safety profile for concurrent selective inhibition of BTK with either PI3K\u03b4 or SYK. Document [26] mentions that tirabrutinib is considered to be highly effective for both untreated and relapsed/refractory Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia with a manageable safety profile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
