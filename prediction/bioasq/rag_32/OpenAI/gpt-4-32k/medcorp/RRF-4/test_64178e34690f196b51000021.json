    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Viltolarsen is a medication used for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping, as stated in Document [0]. Document [1] shows that viltolarsen was able to induce dystrophin expression and was safe and well tolerated in a phase 1/2 study. Document [2] also supports the potential clinical benefit of viltolarsen. Document [5] states that the FDA concluded that the applicant's data demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in people with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 53 skipping. Document [6] shows that long-term outcomes in viltolarsen treated patients were compared to a matched historical control group and viltolarsen showed stabilization from baseline through week 109 for viltolarsen-treated participants whereas the historical control group showed decline. Document [9] shows that after 20 to 24 weeks of treatment, significant drug-induced dystrophin production was seen in both viltolarsen dose cohorts. All these documents provide evidence that viltolarsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
