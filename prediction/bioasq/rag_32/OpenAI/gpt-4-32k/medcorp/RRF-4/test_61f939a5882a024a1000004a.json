    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tivantinib is a MET inhibitor that has been studied as a potential treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). According to Document [0], [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [10], [12], [14], [16], [18], [20], [21], [24], [26], [27], [28], [30], and [31], tivantinib has shown some promise in treating patients with MET-high HCC, particularly those who have failed previous treatments like sorafenib. However, Document [2], [4], [9], [11], [13], [15], [17], [19], [22], [23], [25], and [29] suggest that tivantinib may not provide significant benefits for MET-high HCC, with some studies showing no significant influence on overall survival, progression-free survival, or time to progression. Therefore, the effectiveness of tivantinib for MET-high HCC is still under debate and further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
