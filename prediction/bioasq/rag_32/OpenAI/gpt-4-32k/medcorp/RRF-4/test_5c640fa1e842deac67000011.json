    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that Tiam1 is related to the metastasis of colorectal carcinoma, and may induce EMT to promote CRC metastasis. Document 1 suggests that TIAM1 promotes chemoresistance and tumor invasiveness in colorectal cancer. Document 2 confirms the role of Tiam1 gene in the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Document 3 provides in vivo evidence supporting that Tiam1 promotes invasion and metastasis of CRC. Document 14 states that Tiam1 affects multiple properties associated with acquisition of the metastatic phenotype, and may represent a marker of colon tumor progression and metastasis. Document 18 states that Tiam1 expression was strongly correlated with several clinicopathological factors of CRC and may represent a favorable prognostic marker in patients with CRC. All these documents suggest that TIAM1 favors tumor progression in colorectal cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
