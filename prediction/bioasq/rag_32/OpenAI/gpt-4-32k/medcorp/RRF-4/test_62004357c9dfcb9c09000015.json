    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that the potential amyloidogenic properties of \u03b1CGRP still remain unexplored, although experimental trials have indicated its presence in deposits, associated with the aforementioned disorders. Therefore, in this work, they investigated the amyloidogenic profile of \u03b1CGRP, a 37-residue-long peptide hormone, utilizing both biophysical experimental techniques and Molecular Dynamics simulations. These efforts unravel a novel amyloidogenic member of the CGRP family and provide insights into the mechanism underlying the \u03b1CGRP polymerization. This indicates that \u03b1CGRP does have amyloidogenic properties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
