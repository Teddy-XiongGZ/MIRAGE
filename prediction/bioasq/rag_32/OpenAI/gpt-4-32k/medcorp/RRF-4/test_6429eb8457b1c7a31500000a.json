    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. They include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA modifications. According to Document [0], adenosine methylation, specifically N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is an epigenetic modification that plays critical roles in multiple cellular processes. This is further supported by Document [1] which discusses the role of adenosine kinase in epigenetic regulation, and Document [5] which mentions that methylation on the N6 position of adenosine affects gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
