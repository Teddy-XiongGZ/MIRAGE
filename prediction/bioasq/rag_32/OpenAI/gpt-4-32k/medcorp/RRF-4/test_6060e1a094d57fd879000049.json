    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] shows that IL18 signaling is critical for the induction of the key thymus-homing chemokine receptor - CCR6 on Tregs. Document [2] also mentions that IL-18 in combination with IL-2 or IL-12 induces IFN-gamma and IL-13 preferentially from DN cells in the thymus. Document [8] suggests that CD11b(+) DCs are differentiated from CD4(-)CD8(-) thymocytes by IL-18 produced from TECs and that they are involved in T cell selection in the fetal thymus. These documents provide evidence that IL18 signaling plays a role in the thymus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
