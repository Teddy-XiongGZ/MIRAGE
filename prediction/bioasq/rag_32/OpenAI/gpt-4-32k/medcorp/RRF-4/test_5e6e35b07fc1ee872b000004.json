    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Astrocytes are a type of glial cell in the brain and spinal cord. According to the documents, they play many roles, including the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is a highly selective semipermeable border that prevents solutes in the circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system. Astrocytes form the parenchymal part of the blood-brain barrier and communicate with endothelial cells through the secretion of growth factors, morphogens, and extracellular vesicles. These secreted factors control the integrity of the blood-brain barrier through the regulation of the expression of tight junction proteins. Therefore, astrocytes are part of the blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
