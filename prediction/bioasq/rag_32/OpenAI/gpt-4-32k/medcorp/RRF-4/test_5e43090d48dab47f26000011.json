Document [4] mentions that mesenchymal stem cells are considered a promising tool for therapeutic application in acute kidney injury management. Document [6] mentions that stem cell therapies have been applied to repair injured kidneys. Document [10] mentions that cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells is very promising and should be part of the treatment of acute kidney injury patients. Document [18] mentions that stem cell-based therapy has provided new hopes of innovative interventions to enhance the limited capability of kidney regeneration in acute kidney injury. Document [19] mentions that stem cell-based therapy has provided new hopes of innovative interventions to enhance the limited capability of kidney regeneration in acute kidney injury. Document [21] mentions that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells can ameliorate acute kidney injury through both paracrine effects and repair of injured microvasculature. Document [24] mentions that stem cell-based therapy has provided new hopes of innovative interventions to enhance the limited capability of kidney regeneration in acute kidney injury. Document [30] mentions that interest has recently been focused on the possible role of bone marrow originating stem cells in endogenous repair of the injured tubule. All these documents suggest that stem cell transplants are being used to treat acute kidney injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
