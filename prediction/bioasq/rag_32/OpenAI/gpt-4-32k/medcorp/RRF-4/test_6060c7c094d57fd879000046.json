    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cadherins are a group of functionally related glycoproteins responsible for the Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion mechanism. They are integral membrane proteins, meaning they are embedded in the cell membrane. Cadherins are present on the plasma membranes of cells, as mentioned in multiple documents. For example, Document [0] mentions that E-cadherin is a component of the plasma membrane. Document [24] also mentions that cadherin molecules are present on the plasma membranes of human spermatozoa and oocytes. Therefore, cadherin can be considered a plasma membrane marker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
