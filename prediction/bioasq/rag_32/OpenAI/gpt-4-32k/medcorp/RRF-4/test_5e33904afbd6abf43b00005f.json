    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple documents mention that radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease increases the risk of lung cancer. For example, Document [0] states that survivors of Hodgkin's disease are at a substantially increased risk of lung cancer and that all forms of Hodgkin's disease therapy, including radiotherapy, are carcinogenic to the lung. Document [1] also mentions that risk of lung cancer is significantly increased in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease, with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy contributing to the risk. Document [2] further supports this by stating that a significant increase in risk of lung cancer was observed with increasing radiation dose. Therefore, the answer is yes, radiotherapy for Hodgkin disease increases the risk for lung cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
