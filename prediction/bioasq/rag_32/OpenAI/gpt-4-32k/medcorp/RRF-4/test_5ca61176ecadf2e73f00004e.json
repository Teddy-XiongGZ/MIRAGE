    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that TAD disruption is often found in cancer cells and contributes to oncogenesis. Document [1] states that disruption of TAD boundaries can affect the expression of nearby genes, and this can cause disease. Document [2] also mentions that TAD boundary disruptions in certain cancers can result in oncogene overexpression. Document [3] discusses how the disruption of TAD structures by genomic rearrangements can result in gene misexpression and disease. Document [4] provides an example of how disruptions at the TAD boundary can lead to 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Document [26] also mentions that TADs regulate gene expression and their disruption has been associated with cancer. All these documents provide evidence that TAD disruption can lead to disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
