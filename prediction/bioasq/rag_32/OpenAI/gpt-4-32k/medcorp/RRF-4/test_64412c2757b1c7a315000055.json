    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that breastfeeding can be used to alleviate procedural pain in neonates. For example, Document [0] states that breastfeeding had significantly less increase in the heart rate, reduced proportion of crying time and reduced duration of crying compared to the swaddled or pacifier group. Document [1] also supports this, stating that breastfeeding had a significantly lower increase in heart rate, reduced proportion of crying time and reduced duration of first cry and total crying time compared to other interventions.
