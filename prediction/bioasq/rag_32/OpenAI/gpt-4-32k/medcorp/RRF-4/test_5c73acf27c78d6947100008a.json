    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Semagacestat was developed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the gamma-secretase enzyme, which is involved in the generation of beta-amyloid, a peptide believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, according to the documents, phase III trials of Semagacestat were stopped due to disappointing results. The drug performed worse than the placebo and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living.

Therefore, it can be concluded that Semagacestat is not effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
