    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information about the use of cabozantinib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Document [0] mentions that cabozantinib is a strong multi-inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases that could be useful for the treatment of HCC. Document [1] states that cabozantinib has demonstrated an improved overall survival and progression-free survival in the phase 3 CELESTIAL study in second and third line, in patients in good general condition. Document [2] also mentions that the phase III CELESTIAL trial demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement in overall survival with cabozantinib in patients with advanced HCC previously treated with sorafenib. Document [3] also supports the efficacy of cabozantinib in HCC, stating that it prolonged both overall survival and progression-free survival. Document [14] provides the results of the CELESTIAL trial, stating that treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that cabozantinib is effective for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
