    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] shows that proteins from Schistosoma japonicum can inhibit allergic asthma via immune regulation. Document [1] also supports this, stating that Schistosoma japonicum infection downregulated airway hyperresponsiveness and reduced the infiltrating cells and effector cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and lungs. Document [2] further supports this by stating that Schistosoma japonicum infection led to a significant decrease of eosinophil accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and a marked reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration around the airways and pulmonary blood vessels. Document [3] however, shows that antihelminthic treatments worsened asthma severity, suggesting that the presence of helminths could have a protective role in atopic diseases. Document [13] also supports the idea that Schistosoma japonicum can interrupt the development of asthma by diminishing airway inflammation. Document [17] shows that Schistosoma japonicum egg antigens induced the production of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells, resulting in constitutive immunosuppressive activity and inhibition of asthma development. Therefore, the majority of the documents support the idea that Schistosoma japonicum can prevent or improve asthma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
