    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents mention the use of salivary cortisol as a measure of stress or pain in neonates. For example, Document [0] mentions that salivary cortisol reactivity has been used to evaluate stress in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Document [1] also mentions the use of salivary cortisol to investigate stress responses in neonates. Document [3] discusses the use of salivary cortisol to assess pain in preterm infants. Document [5] states that salivary and plasma cortisol levels were correlated in premature infants, suggesting that salivary cortisol could be used to evaluate stress or pain. Document [9] mentions an increase in salivary cortisol in response to painful stimulus, suggesting its potential use in pain assessment. Therefore, it seems that salivary cortisol can indeed be used to evaluate pain in neonates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
