    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [2] states that the relationship between the accessibility and activity of an enhancer is insufficiently described by simply considering open versus closed chromatin, or active versus inactive enhancers. It also mentions that while the open structure as such is not a specific indicator of enhancer activity, active enhancers display a higher degree of accessibility than the primed and repressed states. This suggests that not all accessible enhancers are necessarily active. Document [19] also supports this by stating that bidirectional transcription initiation from accessible chromatin is not sufficient for, nor specific to, enhancer activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
