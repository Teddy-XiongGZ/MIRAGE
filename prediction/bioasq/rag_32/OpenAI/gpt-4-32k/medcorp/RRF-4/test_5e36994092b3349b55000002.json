    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that TET proteins regulate iNKT cell fate by ensuring their proper development and maturation and by suppressing aberrant proliferation mediated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). Document [2] also mentions that TET proteins regulate the expression of the lineage specifying factor Th-POK, which is crucial for iNKT cell development. Document [24] also mentions the role of TET in the epigenetic regulation of iNKT cell development and lineage choice. Therefore, it is clear that TET proteins play a role in iNKT cell fate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
