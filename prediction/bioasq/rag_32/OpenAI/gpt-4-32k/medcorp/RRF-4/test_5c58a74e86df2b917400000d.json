    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 states that baloxavir treatment resulted in shorter duration of fever than oseltamivir treatment for influenza virus overall, influenza B virus, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Document 1 mentions that baloxavir is efficacious in improving influenza symptoms and can reduce influenza viral load more rapidly than oseltamivir. Document 2 shows that baloxavir reduced the time to alleviation of influenza symptoms and time to resolution of fever in adults, adolescents, and children. Document 3 suggests that baloxavir is superior to placebo in the treatment of influenza in both clinical outcome and virological response. Document 10 states that baloxavir was significantly more effective than NAIs for treating patients with influenza A in clinical practice.
