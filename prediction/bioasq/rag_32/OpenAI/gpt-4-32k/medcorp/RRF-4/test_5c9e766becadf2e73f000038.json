    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 1 mentions that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) or membrane nanotubes can carry components of the cytoplasm such as vesicles and organelles between cells, including whole mitochondria. Document 3 also mentions that horizontal transfer of mitochondria is mediated by actin-rich membrane protrusions named tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). Document 14 also mentions that studies have shown several structures that conduct transcellular transfer of mitochondria, including tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). These documents clearly indicate that mitochondria can pass through membrane nanotubes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
