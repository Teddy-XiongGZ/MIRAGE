    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that Selinexor in combination with dexamethasone has emerged as a viable option for heavily pretreated triple-class relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The Boston trial demonstrated that selinexor when combined with dexamethasone and bortezomib is associated with a better depth and duration of response without excessive toxicity, compared with bortezomib and dexamethasone alone. Document [3] also mentions that Selinexor in combination with dexamethasone (Sd) received an accelerated FDA approval on July 2019 for heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) based on the promising results of the Phase II STORM trial. Document [15] also confirms that Selinexor is approved in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. All these documents suggest that Selinexor is effective for multiple myeloma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
