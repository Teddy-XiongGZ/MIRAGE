    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that yeast LTR elements generate circular DNAs through recombination events between their flanking long terminal repeats (LTRs). Document [1] also mentions that extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) derived from chromosomal Ty retrotransposons in yeast can be generated in multiple ways, including by LTR-LTR recombination. Therefore, it is clear that yeast LTR can give rise to circular DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
