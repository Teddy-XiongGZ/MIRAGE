    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that breastfeeding confers protection from both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Document [1] also supports this, stating that breastfeeding has been shown to be an important risk factor for developing diabetes. Document [2] shows that a longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with a protective effect against diabetes. Document [3] and [4] focus more on type 2 diabetes, but they still suggest a protective effect of breastfeeding. Document [7] and [8] also suggest that longer and exclusive breastfeeding is a protective factor against type 1 diabetes. Document [13] suggests that breastfeeding for more than 3 months reduced the risk of T2DM and delayed the development of T2DM by a further 10 years compared to breastfeeding for less than 3 months. Document [22] suggests that breastfeeding in infancy is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, with marginally lower insulin concentrations in later life, and with lower blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations in infancy. Document [26] suggests that breastfeeding for longer than 4 months has a substantial protective effect against the development of diabetes in young adulthood, which is independent of current BMI. Document [30] suggests that children who were never breastfed had a twofold increased risk of type 1 diabetes compared with those who were breastfed. Therefore, the answer is yes, breastfeeding can confer protection from type I diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
