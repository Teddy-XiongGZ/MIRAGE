    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1) is primarily caused by mutations in the KMT2D gene. However, the question specifically asks about missense variants in exons 38 or 39 of the KMT2D gene. According to Document [10], missense variants in these specific exons of KMT2D cause a multiple malformations syndrome that is distinct from KS1. Therefore, these specific missense variants do not cause KS1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
