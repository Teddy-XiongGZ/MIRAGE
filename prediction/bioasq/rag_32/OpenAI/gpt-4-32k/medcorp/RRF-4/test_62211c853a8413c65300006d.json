    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], most of the circRNAs reported to date originate from back splicing of a pre-mRNA, and these exonic circRNAs are termed canonical circRNAs. Document [1] also mentions that circRNAs can originate from the interior regions of exons, introns, and intergenic transcripts. Document [13] states that circRNAs can be derived from exons, introns, or exons with intron retained between exons of transcripts, as well as antisense transcripts. Therefore, it can be concluded that circRNA is produced by back splicing of both exon and intron, forming both exon and intron circRNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
