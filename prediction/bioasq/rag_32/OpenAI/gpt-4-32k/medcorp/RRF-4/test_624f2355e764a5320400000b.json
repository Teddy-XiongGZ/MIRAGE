    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The SNOT-22 is mentioned in multiple documents as a tool for assessing symptoms, health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL), and treatment response in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). For example, Document [0] describes the SNOT-22 as the reference questionnaire for these assessments. Document [1] also mentions the SNOT-22 as a tool for predicting patient-perceived CRS symptom control. Document [2] discusses the use of SNOT-22 in patients diagnosed with CRS. These references suggest that the SNOT-22 is indeed widely used for measuring HRQOL associated with CRS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
