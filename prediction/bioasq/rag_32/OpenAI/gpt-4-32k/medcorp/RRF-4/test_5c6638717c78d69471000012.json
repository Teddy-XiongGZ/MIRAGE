    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that celecoxib did not slow the decline in muscle strength, vital capacity, motor unit number estimates, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, or affect survival in ALS patients. Document [1] shows that celecoxib alone had no therapeutic effect, but when combined with Ciprofloxacin, it showed significant improvement in zebrafish models of ALS. However, this is not enough to conclude its effectiveness in human ALS patients. Document [14] also mentions a study where celecoxib combined with ciprofloxacin showed some promising results in ALS patients, but this is still in the exploratory stage and requires further investigation. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that celecoxib alone is not effective in treating ALS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
