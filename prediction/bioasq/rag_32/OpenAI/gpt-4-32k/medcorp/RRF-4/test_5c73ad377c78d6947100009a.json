    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about the effect of Panitumumab on the survival of biliary tract cancer patients. Document [0] states that the study showed no consistent differences between adding panitumumab or bevacizumab to chemotherapy in nonresectable BTC and none of the two regimens qualify for testing in Phase III. Document [1] states that Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer. Document [2] also confirms that Panitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin does not prolong survival in wild-type KRAS advanced biliary tract cancer. Document [10] suggests that second-line chemotherapy improves survival of real world patients with advanced biliary tract and gallbladder cancers and should be offered to the patients who are potential candidates for chemotherapy. However, it does not mention Panitumumab. Document [18] states that adding panitumumab to standard protocols does not prolong survival but provokes additional adverse effects. Document [24] states that Panitumumab significantly improved PFS with manageable toxicity in patients with chemorefractory colorectal cancer. However, this is about colorectal cancer, not biliary tract cancer. Document [27] states that Panitumumab significantly improved PFS but was associated with very high rates of grades 3-4 toxicities and survival results did not meet the trial's goal for success. This is about pancreatic cancer, not biliary tract cancer. Document [29] states that Panitumumab significantly improved PFS with manageable toxicity in patients with chemorefractory colorectal cancer. However, this is about colorectal cancer, not biliary tract cancer. Based on these documents, it seems that Panitumumab does not prolong survival in biliary tract cancer patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
