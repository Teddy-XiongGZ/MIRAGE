This is due to the ionizing radiation involved in the CT scan process. However, it's important to note that the risk is generally low and the use of CT scans is often clinically necessary. Therefore, while the risk is present, it is typically outweighed by the benefits of accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
