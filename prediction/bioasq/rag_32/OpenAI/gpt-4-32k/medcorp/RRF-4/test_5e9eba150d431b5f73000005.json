    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that while orthologs for other insulator proteins were absent in all 35 analysed nematode species, they found orthologs of CTCF in a subset of nematodes. This suggests that some nematodes do contain a CTCF gene. However, the document also mentions that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans. This implies that not all nematodes contain a CTCF gene. Document [31] also confirms the under-representation of CTCF binding sites in Caenorhabditis elegans. Therefore, while some nematodes may contain a CTCF gene, others do not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
