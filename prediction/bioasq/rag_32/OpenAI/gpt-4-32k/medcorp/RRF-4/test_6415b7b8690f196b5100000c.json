    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Optogenetics is a field that combines genetic and optical methods to control and monitor the activities of individual cells in living tissue, even within freely moving animals, with a high degree of temporal and spatial precision. It is used to dynamically control gene expression. However, the term 'optimization' implies improving efficiency or performance, and while optogenetics can provide precise control over gene expression, it does not inherently involve the optimization of gene expression. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
