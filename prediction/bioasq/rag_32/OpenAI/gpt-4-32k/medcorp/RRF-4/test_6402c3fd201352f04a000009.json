    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The RIGHT-2 trial was mentioned in several documents. Document 0 states that GTN was associated with improved functional outcome observed at 90 days and one year in patients with stroke mimics. However, this does not directly answer the question about the effectiveness of GTN for stroke. Document 1 describes the design of the RIGHT-2 trial but does not provide results. Document 5 provides the results of the RIGHT-2 trial, stating that prehospital treatment with transdermal GTN does not seem to improve functional outcome in patients with presumed stroke. Therefore, according to the results of the RIGHT-2 trial, prehospital transdermal glyceryl trinitrate was not effective for stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
