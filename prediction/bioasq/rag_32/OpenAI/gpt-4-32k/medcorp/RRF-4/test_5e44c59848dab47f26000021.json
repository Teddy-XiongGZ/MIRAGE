    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a lot of information about the effects of tirilazad on ischemic stroke. Document [0] states that tirilazad had no significant effect on infarct volume, which is a key measure of stroke severity. Document [1] states that tirilazad did not alter early case fatality or end-of-trial case fatality, and actually increased the rate of death and disability. Document [2] states that tirilazad fails to treat, and even worsens a stroke when studied on a human being. Document [3] also states that tirilazad increased the odds of being dead or disabled by about one fifth. Document [8] states that tirilazad does not improve overall functional outcome. Document [10] suggests that antioxidant compounds with improved brain parenchymal penetration are better able to limit certain types of ischemic brain damage compared to those which are localized in the cerebral microvasculature, like tirilazad. Document [11] states that tirilazad had no effect on clinical outcome but did decrease symptomatic vasospasm in five trials of aneurysmal SAH. Document [12] states that tirilazad mesylate increased the combined end-point of 'death or disability' by about one-fifth, but did not alter case fatality, when given to patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Document [18] states that tirilazad, 6 mg/kg per day for 3 days administered beginning at a median of 4.3 hours after stroke, does not improve overall functional outcome. Document [22] states that tirilazad administration decreased CSF pressure during spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion and, like CSF drainage, increased and improved the perfusion pressure to the spinal cord, decreased spinal cord damage, and improved functional outcome. However, this is not directly related to ischemic stroke. Document [24] states that tirilazad administration alone and CSF drainage alone induced a decrease in CSF pressure and the two combined produced a further decrease. This change in CSF pressure and perfusion pressure correlated with improved functional neurological outcome. However, this is not directly related to ischemic stroke. Document [26] states that tirilazad reduced brain edema after middle cerebral artery ligation in hypertensive rats. However, this is not directly related to ischemic stroke. Document [27] states that pretreatment with desmethyl tirilazad or dizocilpine maleate or nimodipine individually significantly suppressed the increase in cNOS activity and cGMP levels induced by cerebral ischemia, which may be related to their neuroprotective effect. However, this is not directly related to ischemic stroke. Document [28] states that tirilazad mesylate is safe in SAH patients at doses up to 6 mg/kg per day for up to 10 days and is a promising drug for the treatment of patients with aneurysmal SAH. However, this is not directly related to ischemic stroke. Document [29] states that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day, is safe and improves overall outcome in patients (especially in men) who have experienced an aneurysmal SAH. However, this is not directly related to ischemic stroke. Document [30] states that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day, is safe and improves overall outcome in patients (especially in men) who have experienced an aneurysmal SAH. However, this is not directly related to ischemic stroke. Document [31] states that the lipid peroxidation inhibitor tirilazad administered after perinatal HI reduced brain damage by 30%, but no effect was found on early postinsult edema. However, this is not directly related to ischemic stroke. Based on these documents, it seems that tirilazad does not have a significant positive effect on the treatment of ischemic stroke, and may even increase the rate of death and disability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
