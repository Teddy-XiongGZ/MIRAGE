    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several times that the crystal structure of Pim-1 has been determined. For example, Document [1] mentions that the crystal structures of apo Pim-1 kinase and its AMP-PNP complex have been determined. Document [0] also mentions that they have solved the crystal structure of Pim-1. Therefore, the crystal structure of Pim-1 is available.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
