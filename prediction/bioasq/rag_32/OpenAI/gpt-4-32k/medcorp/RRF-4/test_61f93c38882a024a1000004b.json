    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] states that long-term treatment with immediate-release isradipine did not slow the clinical progression of early-stage PD. Document [2] suggests that greater exposure to isradipine might slow disease progression, but this is based on a re-analysis of previous trial data. Document [17] also mentions that a clinical phase III trial testing isradipine in patients with early Parkinson's failed to show efficacy in slowing the progression of the disease. Document [25] concludes that there is currently a lack of evidence for the use of antihypertensive drugs, including isradipine, for either the primary or secondary prevention of PD. Therefore, based on the available documents, it seems that isradipine does not slow the progression of early Parkinson's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
