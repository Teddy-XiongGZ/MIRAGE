    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what capmatinib is. From Document [0], I learned that capmatinib is an oral, small molecule mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) inhibitor developed for the treatment of lung cancer. It targets and selectively binds to MET, including the mutant variant produced by exon 14 skipping, and inhibits cancer cell growth driven by the mutant MET variant. It received its first global approval in the USA for the treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping. Clinical development for the treatment of glioblastoma, among other cancers, is ongoing. However, from Document [3], I learned that in a study of capmatinib for glioblastoma, the best response was stable disease in 30% of patients, and enrollment was halted due to limited activity with capmatinib monotherapy. This suggests that capmatinib may not be very effective for glioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
