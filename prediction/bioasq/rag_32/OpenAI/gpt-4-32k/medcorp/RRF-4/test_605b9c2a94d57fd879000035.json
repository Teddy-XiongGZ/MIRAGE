    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amblyopia, also known as 'lazy eye', is a disorder of sight that occurs when the brain fails to fully process inputs from one eye and over time favors the other eye. This results in decreased vision in an eye that typically appears normal in other respects. The cause of amblyopia can be any condition that interferes with focusing during early childhood. This can occur from poor alignment of the eyes, an eye being irregularly shaped such that focusing is difficult, one eye being more nearsighted or farsighted than the other, or clouding of the lens of an eye. Therefore, it is clear that Amblyopia does affect the eye.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
