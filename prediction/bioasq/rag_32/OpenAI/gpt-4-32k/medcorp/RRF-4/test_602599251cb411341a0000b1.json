    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that exposure to bDMARDs during pregnancy does not seem to interfere with post-natal development up to infancy. Document [1] also suggests that there are no major concerns or an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for maternal or paternal exposures to non-TNFi bDMARDs or tsDMARDs. Document [22] also suggests that exposure to anti-TNF therapies at conception and/or during pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes or any increase in congenital abnormalities. Therefore, the use of bDMARDs during pregnancy does not seem to negatively impact neonatal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
