    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [3] states that PRDM9 is not required for completion of male meiosis. Document [5] also mentions that genetic background and sex-specific modifiers can obviate the requirement for PRDM9 in mice. Document [17] also suggests that PRDM9 shapes meiotic recombination landscapes, but it is unnecessary for recombination. These documents suggest that while PRDM9 plays a significant role in meiosis, it is not absolutely essential for the process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
