    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided contain multiple references to the formation of double-strand breaks in DNA as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation. For instance, Document [0] discusses the formation of strand breaks in cellular DNA due to ionizing radiation. Document [4] also mentions that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generally accepted to be the most biologically significant lesion by which ionizing radiation causes cancer. Document [14] talks about clustered DNA damages induced by ionizing radiation, which includes double-strand breaks. Therefore, it is clear that ionizing radiation is associated with breaks in double-stranded DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
