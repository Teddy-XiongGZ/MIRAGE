    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed evidence on the efficacy of deflazacort versus prednisone/prednisolone in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Some documents suggest that deflazacort may provide similar or slower rates of functional decline compared to prednisone/prednisolone (Document 0), while others suggest that deflazacort may provide clinically meaningful delays in loss of physical milestones over 48 weeks compared with prednisone/prednisolone (Document 10). However, other documents suggest that prednisone may be more beneficial than deflazacort (Document 1). Furthermore, a study (Document 27) found that both daily prednisone and daily deflazacort were more effective than intermittent prednisone, but there was no significant difference between the two daily corticosteroid regimens. Therefore, it seems that the efficacy of deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone may be similar, and the choice between the two may depend on other factors such as side effects, cost, and patient preference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
