    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Several documents mention that lactotransferrin acts as a tumor suppressor. For instance, Document [6] states that lactotransferrin has been confirmed to act as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. Document [8] suggests that lactotransferrin may negatively regulate the development and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Document [13] also mentions that lactotransferrin suppresses AKT signaling, leading to inhibition of nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumorigenesis. Document [16] states that lactotransferrin can inhibit the growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma via direct cellular inhibition as well as systemically via immunomodulation. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that lactotransferrin acts as a tumor suppressor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
