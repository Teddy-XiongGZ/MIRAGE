    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] discusses a study on the safety and tolerability of dexmecamylamine as an adjunct to SSRIs/SNRIs in patients with major depressive disorder. However, it does not provide clear evidence on the effectiveness of dexmecamylamine in treating depression. Document [2] and [3] report that no specific therapeutic effects were observed for dexmecamylamine adjunct to antidepressant in the primary endpoint or any secondary endpoint. Document [27] suggests that drugs targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, like dexmecamylamine, may represent a new approach to the treatment of depression, but it does not provide concrete evidence of dexmecamylamine's effectiveness. Based on these documents, it seems that while dexmecamylamine has been studied as a potential treatment for depression, the evidence does not conclusively show that it is effective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
