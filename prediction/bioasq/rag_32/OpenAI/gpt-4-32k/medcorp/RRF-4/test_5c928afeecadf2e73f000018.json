    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardiospheres are a type of stem cell that can be used for cardiac regeneration. According to Document [0], there is interest in generating cardiosphere-like stem cells from somatic cells via somatic reprogramming. This approach would provide an unlimited source of stem cells with cardiac differentiation potential. The document specifically mentions the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to generate induced cardiospheres. Document [2] also describes a novel approach to generate induced cardiospheres from adult skin fibroblasts via somatic reprogramming. Therefore, it seems that cardiospheres can indeed be produced from skin fibroblasts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
