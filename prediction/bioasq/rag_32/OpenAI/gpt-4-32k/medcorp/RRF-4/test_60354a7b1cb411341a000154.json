    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that diastase activity is a composition criterion that must be determined for honeys intended for human consumption. Document [1] also mentions that in natural beehoney, the amount of saccharose, amylase (diastase) and invertase mainly depends on the degree of maturation and physiological status of the bee families during yield of honey. Document [2] characterizes the major alpha-amylase in honey. Document [4] mentions that one of the quality parameters of honey is diastase/amylase activity. Document [17] mentions that a diastase is any one of a group of enzymes that catalyses the breakdown of starch into maltose. Document [19] mentions that diastase activity in honey can be determined quickly and non-destructively with Vis/NIR spectral methods. All these documents confirm that honey contains diastases/amylases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
