    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Curare is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that blocks the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction. It occupies the same position on the receptor as acetylcholine (ACh) but elicits no response, making it a competitive antagonist. This means that curare does not stimulate the acetylcholine receptor, but rather it blocks it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
