    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lubeluzole has shown neuroprotective activity in preclinical models of ischemic stroke and has been tested in several clinical trials. However, the results of these trials have been mixed. Some studies have found that lubeluzole can improve clinical outcomes and neurological recovery in patients with acute ischemic stroke, but others have found no significant difference between lubeluzole and placebo in terms of efficacy. Furthermore, some studies have raised safety concerns about lubeluzole, including the potential for it to cause heart-conduction disorders and prolong the QT interval, which could lead to heart failure. Given these mixed results and potential safety concerns, it is not clear that lubeluzole should be used for the treatment of ischemic stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
