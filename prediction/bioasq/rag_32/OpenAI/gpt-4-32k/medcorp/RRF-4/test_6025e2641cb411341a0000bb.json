    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] shows that high dose thiotepa and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is feasible in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma, but it doesn't provide a clear recommendation. Document [1] suggests that high-dose thiotepa is effective in several types of recurrent pediatric solid tumors, including osteosarcoma. However, Document [4] states that high-dose thiotepa (HDTp) after standard chemotherapy (SCT) in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma failed to significantly improve overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Therefore, despite a trend of prolonged survival and an acceptable toxicity, thiotepa cannot be recommended. This conclusion is supported by Document [14], which suggests that high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT might be effective for poor responders in osteosarcoma, but it doesn't specifically recommend thiotepa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
