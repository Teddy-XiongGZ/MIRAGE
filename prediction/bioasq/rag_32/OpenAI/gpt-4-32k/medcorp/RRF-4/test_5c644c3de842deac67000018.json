    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] suggests that cohesin plays a critical role in hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and differentiation. Document [1] also mentions that cohesin is critically important for proper sister chromatid separation during mitosis and its mutations were identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Document [2] further supports the involvement of cohesin mutations in myeloid neoplasms. Document [3] also mentions the impact of cohesin alterations on self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Document [14] suggests that cohesin likely regulates B cell activation and maturation, including Ig class switching. Document [26] also suggests a dose dependency for cohesin in regulating chromatin structure and HSC function. All these documents suggest that cohesin is linked to myeloid differentiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
