    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple documents mention the existence of an interferon (IFN) signature in SLE patients. For instance, Document [0] mentions an IFN signature in SLE characterized by an activation of the IFN system. Document [1] also discusses the role of type I interferon (IFN) in SLE and the existence of an IFN signature. Document [2] further confirms the presence of an increased expression of type I IFN-regulated genes, termed IFN signature, in patients with SLE. Therefore, it is clear that an IFN signature does exist for SLE patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
