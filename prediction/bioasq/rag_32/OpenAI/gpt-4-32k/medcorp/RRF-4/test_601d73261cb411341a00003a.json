    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Craniostenosis, also known as craniosynostosis, is a condition characterized by the premature fusion of cranial sutures. According to the documents, there are both genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of this condition. Document [0] mentions that mutations in the FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1, and EFNB1 genes account for approximately 25% of craniosynostosis cases. Document [1] also mentions that a third of the patients with this condition have Apert syndrome or Crouzon syndrome, which are known to have a genetic basis. Document [8] further supports this by stating that FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR1, TWIST1 and EFNB1 genes are major causative genes of genetic syndromes associated with craniosynostosis. Therefore, it is clear that there is a genetic cause of craniostenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
