    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 shows that HUWE1 modulates c-MYC, an oncogene frequently dysregulated in multiple myeloma. Document 1 shows that HUWE1 overexpression inhibited CaP proliferation and migration in vitro, and explant growth in vivo. On the other hand, HUWE1 downregulation had no effects on CaP in vitro. C-Myc was downregulated in HUWE1-overexpressed, but un-changed in HUWE1-downregulated, CaP cells. Document 4 shows that inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 stabilizes MIZ1 and leads to the selective repression of MYC\u2010activated target genes. Document 6 shows that TRIM37 binds to HUWE1. HUWE1 was upregulated in OC cells and TRIM37 promoted the c-MYC expression through targeting HUWE1. Document 8 shows that HUWE1 is required for growth of colorectal cancer cells in culture and in orthotopic xenograft models. Using high-throughput screening, they identify small molecule inhibitors of HUWE1, which inhibit MYC-dependent transactivation in colorectal cancer cells, but not in stem and normal colon epithelial cells. Document 15 shows that Mule/Huwe1/Arf-BP1 controls murine intestinal stem and progenitor cell proliferation by modulating the Wnt pathway via c-Myc. Document 24 shows that Helicase with zinc finger domain 2 (HELZ2) promoted retinoblastoma tumorigenesis by targeting c-Myc. HELZ2-deficient inhibited retinoblastoma cell proliferation, whereas overexpression of HELZ2 promoted retinoblastoma cell proliferation. In addition, high levels of HELZ2 promoted xenograft retinoblastoma tumorigenesis and inhibited animal survival. Mechanistically, HELZ2 interacted with c-Myc and promoted its K63-linked polyubiquitination. They indicated that HELZ2 promoted the interaction between E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 and c-Myc, and HELZ2-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and activation of c-Myc were dependent on HUWE1. Document 28 shows that Mule/Huwe1/Arf-BP1 suppresses Ras-driven tumorigenesis by preventing c-Myc/Miz1-mediated down-regulation of p21 and p15. All these documents show that HUWE1 plays a role in MYC signalling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
