    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a significant role in the progression of gliomas. TAMs are frequently observed in brain tumors and their density and prognostic role seem to differ between tumor types. High amounts of TAMs, particularly of the M2 phenotype, are associated with poor prognosis in gliomas. TAMs contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, fostering tumor development and contributing to tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, the presence and activity of TAMs in gliomas have a prognostic significance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
