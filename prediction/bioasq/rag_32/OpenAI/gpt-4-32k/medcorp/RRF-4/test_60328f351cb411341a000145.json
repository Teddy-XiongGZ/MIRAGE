    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA) is mentioned in several documents as a substance used to induce arthritis in animal models. For instance, Document [1] describes the development of adjuvant arthritis in mice after injection of Freund's complete adjuvant. Document [2] also mentions that several animal models of arthritis are produced using CFA. Document [5] describes Freund's complete adjuvant-induced arthritis as a commonly used model in rats. Document [14] mentions that CFA containing the inactivated mycobacterium has been conventionally used to induce typical arthritis in rats. Document [15] also mentions that CFA induces arthritis in MRL-lpr mice. Therefore, it is clear that Freund's complete adjuvant can induce arthritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
