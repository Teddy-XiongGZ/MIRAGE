    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study that aimed to evaluate the efficacy of erenumab in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. The study found that there was no difference between the erenumab group and the placebo group in terms of the number of responders. The study concluded that erenumab did not reduce pain intensity compared with placebo in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Document 1, on the other hand, is a retrospective analysis that reported that 90% of patients with trigeminal neuralgia treated with erenumab reported improvement in pain severity. However, this study is not as strong as a randomized controlled trial. Given the conflicting evidence, it seems that the more rigorous study (Document 0) provides stronger evidence that erenumab is not effective for trigeminal neuralgia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
