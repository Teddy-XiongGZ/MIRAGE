    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what the documents say about the effect of simvastatin on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Document [0] states that high-dose simvastatin treatment did not improve clinical outcomes or reduce the incidence of delayed ischemic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Document [2] concludes that simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing the incidence of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, or all-cause mortality after aneurysmal SAH. Document [3] also found that simvastatin intervention had no influence on delayed ischaemic deficit, delayed cerebral infarction, or mortality in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Document [16] concludes that patients with SAH should not be treated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stage. Document [18] states that the STASH trial did not detect any benefit in the use of simvastatin for long-term or short-term outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Document [19] concludes that the role of statins in the management of patients with SAH remains unclear. Document [21] states that statins should not, at this time, be considered standard care at present. Document [23] concludes that no benefits of statins-use for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were observed in both RCTs and observational studies. Document [27] states that statins should not be considered standard care at present. Document [30] concludes that statins should not, at this time, be considered standard care at present. Document [31] states that a higher incidence for DCI was found in the statin group, whereas patients without statin and magnesium tended to have less often DCI. All these documents suggest that simvastatin does not improve outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
