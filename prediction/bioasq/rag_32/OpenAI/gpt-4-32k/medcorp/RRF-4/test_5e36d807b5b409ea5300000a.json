    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] clearly states that the Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis facilitates the transfer of parental histones to lagging-strand DNA at replication forks. However, it does not mention the leading strand. In fact, it mentions that mutating the Mcm2 subunit results in a marked enrichment of parental histones on the leading strand, due to the impairment of the transfer of parental histones to lagging strands. This suggests that the Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis does not play a role in the transfer of histones to the leading strand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
