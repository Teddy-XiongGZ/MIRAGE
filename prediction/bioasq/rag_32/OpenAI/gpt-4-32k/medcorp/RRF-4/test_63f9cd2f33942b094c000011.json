    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that microexons undergo extensive alternative splicing in neurons, microglia, embryonic stem cells, and cancer cells, giving rise to cell type specific protein isoforms. The functional consequences of including microexons within mRNAs have been extensively documented in the central nervous system (CNS) and aberrations in their inclusion have been observed to lead to abnormal processes. This suggests that microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators does have implications in central nervous system diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
