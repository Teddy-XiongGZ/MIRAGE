    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The MYC gene is mentioned in multiple documents as an oncogene, which is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. In several types of cancer, oncogenes are often mutated or expressed at high levels. A tumor suppressor gene, on the other hand, is a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer. When this gene mutates to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer. Therefore, since MYC is an oncogene and not a gene that prevents cancer, it is not a tumor suppressor gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
