    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first document provides a clear answer to the question. It states that despite tissue-specific chromatin states and gene expression, chromatin organization is largely maintained across tissues. This indicates that tissue-specific chromatin conformation is not necessary for tissue-specific gene expression. Therefore, there is no dependence between chromatin organization and dorsoventral gene expression in Drosophila.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
