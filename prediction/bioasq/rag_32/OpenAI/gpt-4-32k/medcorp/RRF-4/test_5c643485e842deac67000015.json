    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that de novo mutations in highly evolutionarily conserved fetal brain-active elements are significantly and specifically enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders. Document [1] also mentions that there is a trend toward an excess of de novo and potentially disruptive mutations among conserved noncoding sequences implicated in the regulation of genes. Document [2] shows that POGZ, one of the most recurrently de novo mutated genes, is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Document [3] also mentions that de novo near-splice site synonymous mutations changing exonic splicing regulators are significantly enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders. Document [26] also mentions that de novo mutations in GRIN2A or GRIN2B can be associated with cases of sporadic neurodevelopmental disorders. All these documents provide evidence that de novo mutations in regulatory elements are responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
