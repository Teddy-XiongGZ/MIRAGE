    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided clearly indicate that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays a significant role in autoimmunity. For instance, Document [0] mentions that BTK can modulate signaling, and its overexpression leads to autoimmunity. Document [1] also states that BTK may promote autoimmunity as an important driver of an imbalance in B-T cell interaction. Document [2] further discusses the role of BTK in key signaling pathways involved in autoimmunity. Therefore, it is clear that BTK is implicated in autoimmunity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
