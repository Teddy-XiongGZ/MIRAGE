    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that a phase 3 study was performed to test the use of intepirdine as adjunctive therapy to donepezil for Alzheimer's disease. However, the results showed no statistically significant differences between intepirdine and placebo groups on the co-primary endpoints. Document [1] also mentions that a phase III clinical trial for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease showed no improvement over the control group. As a result, Axovant, the company developing the drug, lost 70% of its value and discontinued the development of the drug. Document [26] also mentions that phase III trials of intepirdine failed to demonstrate efficacy. Based on these documents, it seems that intepirdine is not effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. no\"}"
