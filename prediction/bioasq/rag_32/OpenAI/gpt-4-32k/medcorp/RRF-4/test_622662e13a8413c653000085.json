    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that METTL3 is part of a complex that can add methyl groups to messenger RNA and long non-coding RNA. Document [1] also mentions that the METTL3-METTL14 complex can transfer a methyl group to adenosine bases in RNA. Document [2] further supports this by stating that METTL3 and METTL14 can interact with long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19. Therefore, it can be concluded that METTL3 can methylate long noncoding RNAs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
