    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phospholemman is described in multiple documents as a membrane protein. For example, Document [0] refers to it as a plasma-membrane protein. Document [19] explains that integral membrane proteins are permanently attached to the biological membrane, and Document [16] states that Phospholemman (PLM) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FXYD1 gene.
