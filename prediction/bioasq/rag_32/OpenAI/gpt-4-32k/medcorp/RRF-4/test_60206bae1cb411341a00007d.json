    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide evidence that DKK1 plays a role in prostate cancer. Document [0] states that high DKK1 serum levels are associated with a poor survival in patients with prostate cancer. Document [2] suggests that DKK1 could suppress the migration and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Document [3] indicates that DKK1 promotes proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer. Document [6] suggests that DKK1 expression can lead to immune evasion in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Document [16] shows that DKK1 expression is down-regulated during the progression from primary tumor to metastasis in prostate cancer. Document [18] suggests that DKK1 promotes tumorigenicity in prostate cancer. Therefore, the evidence suggests that DKK1 does play a role in prostate cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
