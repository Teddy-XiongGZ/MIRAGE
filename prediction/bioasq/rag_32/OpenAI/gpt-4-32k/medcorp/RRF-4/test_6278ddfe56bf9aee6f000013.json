    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 mentions that functional measures continue to serve as the primary outcome for the majority of DMD clinical trials. Document 1 also mentions that the motor function measure is a validated test in patients with neuromuscular disorders and that the 6-minute walk test, timed 10-meter walk/run test, and supine-up time are commonly used timed functional tests that sufficiently monitor changes in muscle function. Document 2 also mentions that composite scores were then correlated to standard measures of function. Document 3 mentions that identification of outcome measures such as the 6-minute walk test, the MFM score, manual muscle testing musculaire, or biomarkers is indispensable for patient follow-up and collaborative studies. Document 5 mentions that significant correlations were found between all qMR and functional measures. Document 10 mentions that manual muscle strength testing remains the most valid method of monitoring disease progression and must be included in patient assessment. Document 18 mentions that muscle adiposity values obtained with three-point Dixon MRI are accurate in assessment of disease severity in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Document 26 mentions that age and Vignos Scale were significantly correlated with creatine kinase and transaminase concentrations. Document 29 mentions that our study shows that dystrophin levels appear not to be a major determinant of disease severity in BMD, as long as it is above approximately 10%. These documents suggest that functional tests are a good biomarker for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
