    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide a variety of studies and reviews on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk. Most of the studies found that SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in breast milk samples, suggesting that the virus is not transmitted through breast milk. However, a few studies did find SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk, but these were rare cases and it was not clear if the virus was infectious.
