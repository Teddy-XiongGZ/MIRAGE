    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardenolides are mentioned in multiple documents as inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase. For instance, Document [0] states that cardiac glycosides, which include cardenolides, inhibit Na+/K+ ATPase. This is further supported by Document [2], which mentions that cardenolides inhibit Na+/K+ ATPase despite having structures different from cardiac glycosides. Document [7] also mentions that modulators of Na/K-ATPase, which include cardenolides, inhibit Na+/K+ exchange. Therefore, it is clear that cardenolides are inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
