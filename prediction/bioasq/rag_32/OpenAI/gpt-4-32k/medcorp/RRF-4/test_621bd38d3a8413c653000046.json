    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 0 mentions that aberrant glycosylation can lead to malignant degeneration and that differences in glycan profiles between the stages of disease progression have been described in esophageal cancer. Document 1 also mentions that aberrant glycosylation has been implicated in various types of cancers and changes in glycosylation may be associated with signaling pathways during malignant transformation. It also mentions that they performed glycomic profiling of serum from patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma to delineate distinct differences in glycosylation. Document 2 also mentions that aberrant glycosylation has been implicated in various types of cancers and that they performed glycomic profiling of serum from patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma to delineate distinct differences in glycosylation. These documents provide evidence that esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with aberrant glycosylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
