Document [1] also recommends screening for SMAD6 mutations in cases of sagittal craniosynostosis. Document [5] states that in sagittal craniosynostosis, the most common mutation is in the SMAD6 gene. These documents provide evidence that SMAD6 variants can cause craniosynostosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
