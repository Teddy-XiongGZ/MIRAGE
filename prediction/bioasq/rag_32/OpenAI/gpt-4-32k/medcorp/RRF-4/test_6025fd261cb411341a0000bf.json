    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide mixed results on the effectiveness of isradipine for Parkinson's disease. Document [0] states that long-term treatment with immediate-release isradipine did not slow the clinical progression of early-stage Parkinson's disease. Document [2] also mentions that higher isradipine plasma exposure did not affect clinical assessment measures of Parkinson's disease severity. Document [3] mentions that isradipine 10 mg daily was the maximal tolerable dosage in a study of early Parkinson's disease, but it does not provide clear evidence of its effectiveness. Document [7] suggests that clinically attainable brain exposure to isradipine may slow early-stage Parkinson's disease progression. However, the majority of the documents suggest that isradipine does not have a significant impact on the progression or symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
