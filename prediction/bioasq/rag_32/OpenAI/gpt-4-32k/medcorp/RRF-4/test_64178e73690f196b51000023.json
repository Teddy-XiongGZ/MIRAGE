    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eteplirsen is a drug that promotes dystrophin production by restoring the translational reading frame of DMD through specific skipping of exon 51 in defective gene variants, as stated in Document [0]. It is applicable for approximately 14% of patients with DMD mutations. Document [1] explains that eteplirsen can restore the production of partially functional dystrophin. Document [2] mentions that eteplirsen has received accelerated approval from the US FDA for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. Document [4] shows that eteplirsen restored dystrophin in the 30 and 50 mg/kg/wk cohorts, and in subsequently treated, placebo-controlled subjects. Document [14] shows that over 3 years of follow-up, eteplirsen-treated patients showed a slower rate of decline in ambulation assessed by 6MWT compared to untreated matched HC. Document [23] mentions that Eteplirsen and Ataluren could modestly reduce disease progression. However, more trials are needed to confirm its efficacy, as well as quality of life and cost-utility studies. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that eteplirsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
