    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"AhR ligands have been considered for pharmaceutical development due to their ability to induce Cyp1a1, as mentioned in Document [0]. However, there has been a long-standing perception that AhR ligands could cause potential toxicities, which has led to their automatic disqualification from pharmaceutical development. Recent discoveries of new AhR ligands with potential therapeutic applications have invited reconsideration of this policy. Therefore, while AhR ligands can induce Cyp1a1, their potential for causing toxicities has made their use in pharmaceutical development controversial.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. yes\"}"
