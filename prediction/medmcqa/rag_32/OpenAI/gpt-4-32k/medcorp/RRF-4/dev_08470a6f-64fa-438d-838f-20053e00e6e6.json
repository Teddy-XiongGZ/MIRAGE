    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molar. Accessory canals are additional canals that may be present in a tooth, apart from the main root canals. They can be located in various parts of the tooth, including the furcation region, which is the area where the roots of a multi-rooted tooth diverge. Document [0] mentions that accessory canals were observed in the pulpal floor of primary molars, with maxillary molars showing a greater number of accessory canals compared to mandibular molars. However, it does not specify the pattern of these canals in mandibular first molars. Document [1] discusses a case of a mandibular molar with aberrant canal configuration, but it does not provide information on the typical pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars. Document [2] mentions that the root and canal anatomy of mandibular first and second molars has normally recurring features, as well as a great number of atypias. However, it does not provide specific information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [3] investigates the apical anatomy of C-shaped canal systems in mandibular second molars, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars. Document [4] studies the prevalence of three roots and four root canals in the mandibular first molars of a Chinese population, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [5] evaluates the incidence of middle mesial (MM) canals in mandibular first and second molars, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [6] evaluates the root canal configuration of permanent mandibular first and second molar teeth in a Chinese subpopulation using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [7] presents clinical reports of mandibular molars with three canals in the mesial root and two in vitro studies of the morphology of these canals, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [8] determines the frequency of the middle mesial canal in the mandibular first molars and its association with various anatomical features, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [9] analyzes root canal anatomy and symmetry of maxillary and mandibular first and second molar teeth of a white population using CBCT, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [10] presents three case reports on the presence of three-rooted mandibular first primary molar, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [11] presents a clinical case report in a mandibular first molar with a middle distal canal, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [12] investigates the root and canal morphology of Sri Lankan mandibular molars, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [13] discusses the importance of understanding the internal anatomy of the teeth for successful endodontic treatment, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars. Document [14] investigates the root and canal morphology of mandibular first and second molars in a Turkish population using CBCT, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [15] verifies the prevalence, location and patency of accessory canals and furcation formina in primary molars using safranin red dye, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars. Document [16] investigates the root canal configuration of maxillary and mandibular first molar using CBCT among patients in Al-Ahsa region, Saudi Arabia, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [17] discusses the importance of looking for additional canals and an unusual canal morphology associated with a mandibular first molar, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [18] evaluates the internal morphology of the distal roots of mandibular first molars using micro-CT, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [19] discusses the endodontic management of the rare anatomical complexity middle mesial canals in mandibular first molar, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [20] presents a unique case of a mandibular molar with 5 canals, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [21] presents a case of a mandibular first molar retreatment in which seven canals were cleaned, shaped, and filled/refilled, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [22] presents a case of multiple mandibular canals of the bifid variety, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [23] presents a case of a mandibular first molar with three mesial canals, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [24] investigates the root canal system morphology of the mandibular first molar by means of micro-computed tomography, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [25] investigates the prevalence, location and patency of accessory canals in primary molars using dye penetration under vacuum suction technique, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars. Document [26] investigates the variations in the number of root and canal in the mandibular first permanent molars teeth in East Coast Malaysian population using CBCT, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [27] identifies and classifies the anatomic variation of mandibular canal among Malaysians of 3 ethnicities, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [28] investigates the root canal system morphology of the mandibular first molar by means of micro-computed tomography, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [29] presents a case of a mandibular molar with 5 canals, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [30] investigates the root canal configuration, foramina, and accessory canals frequency of 118 mandibular first molars by means of micro-computed tomography, but it does not provide information on the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. Document [31] investigates the root canal system morphology of the mandibular first molar by means of micro-computed tomography, but it does not discuss the pattern of accessory canals in these teeth. After reviewing all the documents, it seems that the pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars is variable and can be influenced by various factors, including age.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
