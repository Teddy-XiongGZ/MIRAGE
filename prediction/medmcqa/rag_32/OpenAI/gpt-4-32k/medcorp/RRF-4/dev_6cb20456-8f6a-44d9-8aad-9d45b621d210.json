    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alcoholic hepatitis is a type of liver disease caused by heavy alcohol consumption. According to the documents, several laboratory tests are used to diagnose this condition. These include aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). However, the documents specifically mention that in alcoholic hepatitis, the AST level is usually higher than the ALT level, and the AST/ALT ratio is typically greater than 2.
