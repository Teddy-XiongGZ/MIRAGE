    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a condition that affects the formation of enamel on teeth, and it can manifest in several forms, including hypoplastic, hypomaturation, and hypocalcification. The KLK4 gene is mentioned in several documents, and it is associated with AI. Document [22] states that the enamel layer of KLK4-null mice is less highly mineralized and fractures in its deepest part just above the dentino-enamel junction, which suggests a hypomaturation type of AI. Document [16] also mentions that two novel inactivating KLK4 mutations caused a hypomaturation AI phenotype. Therefore, the KLK4 gene mutation is associated with the hypomaturation type of amelogenesis imperfecta.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Hypomaturation\"}"
