    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retraction of the mandible refers to the movement of the mandible backward. According to Document [31], the hyoglossus muscle is responsible for retracting the tongue, which could imply a similar function for the mandible. However, none of the options provided in the question include the hyoglossus muscle. Therefore, we need to look at the other muscles mentioned in the options. The medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and masseter are primarily involved in chewing and moving the jaw side-to-side or forward, not backward. The temporalis muscle, on the other hand, is known for its role in closing the jaw, but it also assists in retracting the mandible, as it has fibers that run horizontally and posteriorly, which would pull the mandible backward.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
