    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The wetting angle is a measure of how well a liquid spreads and how complete the contact of the liquid is across the surface of a solid interface. A small contact angle indicates good wettability, while a large contact angle indicates poor wettability. For a bonding agent to be effective, it needs to have good wettability with the surface it is bonding to. In the context of dental bonding, this would be the dental hard tissue, which includes both dentin and enamel. Therefore, the wetting angle should be minimum with dental hard tissue for the bonding agent to be effective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
