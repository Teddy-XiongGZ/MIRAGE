Most monosaccharides, including glucose, galactose and fructose, spontaneously bond with hemoglobin, when present in the bloodstream of humans. However, glucose is less likely to do so but to a much greater extent, especially in high concentrations. The resulting molecule is an indicator of the average blood glucose level over the previous 30 to 120 days, depending on the lifespan of individual red blood cells.
