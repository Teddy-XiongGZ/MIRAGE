    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common after major surgeries and can be influenced by various factors. According to the documents, factors such as age, type of surgery, pre-existing pulmonary diseases, and smoking history can increase the risk of PPCs. Document [30] mentions that duration of anaesthesia, surgical category, current smoking, respiratory co-morbidity, and predicted maximal oxygen uptake are risk factors for PPCs. Document [31] also identifies age \u2265 65 years, duration of operation \u2265 2.5 hours, history of previous pulmonary diseases and ASA > 2 as independent risk factors for PPCs. However, none of the documents mention BMI>30 as a risk factor for PPCs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
