    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a material that behaves like a solid under low applied stresses but starts to flow like a liquid above a certain level of stress, called the yield stress. According to Document [3], this behavior is characteristic of a Bingham body. The other options do not match the description given in the question. A Newtonian body has a linear relationship between shear stress and strain rate, which is not the case here. A dilatant, according to Document [8], is a material that increases its viscosity under stress, which is also not the case here. A pseudoplastic, as mentioned in Document [8], is a material that decreases its viscosity under stress, which is not the case here either.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
