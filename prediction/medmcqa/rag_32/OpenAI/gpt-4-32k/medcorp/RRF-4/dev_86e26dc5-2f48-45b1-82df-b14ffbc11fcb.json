    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital cholesteatoma is a rare condition that occurs in the ear. According to Document [2], congenital cholesteatomas occur at three important sites: the middle ear, the Petrous apex, and the cerebropontinio angle. However, the question is specifically asking for the most common site within the tympanic membrane.

This suggests that the most common site for congenital cholesteatoma is the anterior superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
