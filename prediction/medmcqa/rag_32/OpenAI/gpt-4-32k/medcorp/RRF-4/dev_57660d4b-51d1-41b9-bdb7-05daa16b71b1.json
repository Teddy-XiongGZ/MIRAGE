    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mucostatic impression materials are those that take an impression with the mucosa in its normal resting position, without applying any pressure or causing displacement. From the documents, it is clear that plaster of Paris (Document 3), zinc oxide eugenol impression paste (Document 13), and reversible hydrocolloids (Document 12) are all described as mucostatic. However, Document 4 specifically lists impression plaster and light body elastomers as mucostatic materials, but does not mention zinc oxide eugenol impression paste or reversible hydrocolloids in this category. Free flowing wax is not mentioned in any of the documents as a mucostatic material. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most mucostatic impression material would be a thin mix of plaster of Paris.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
