    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Taenia solium. The disease has different stages, including vesicular, vesicular colloidal, granular nodular, and nodular calcified. Edema, or swelling caused by fluid accumulation, is a common symptom in many stages of the disease. According to Document [29], the pathology of neurocysticercosis varies depending on the stage of the disease. The document does not specify which stage does not involve edema, but it implies that edema is a common symptom in many stages of the disease. However, Document [24] states that the nodular calcified stage of neurocysticercosis does not involve edema. This suggests that the nodular calcified stage is the stage of neurocysticercosis where there is no edema.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Nodular calcified\"}"
