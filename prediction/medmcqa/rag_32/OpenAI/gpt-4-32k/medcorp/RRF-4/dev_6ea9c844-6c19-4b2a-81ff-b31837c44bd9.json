    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common gene defect in idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. Document [1] mentions that more than 30 monogenic genes have been identified to cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Document [2] mentions that 30 to 40 percent of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome are associated with mutations of genes coding for podocyte proteins. Document [8] mentions that NPHS2 encodes a novel membrane protein named podocin localized at the cytoplasmic part of the slit diaphragm. Document [22] mentions that mutations in NPHS2, which encodes the glomerular protein podocin, account for up to 17% of sporadic and 40% of familial cases of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. Document [25] also mentions that NPHS2 mutations are the most frequent genetic cause of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, the most common gene defect in idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome is NPHS2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
