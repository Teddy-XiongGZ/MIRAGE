    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the minimum concentration of oxygen needed in Nitrous Oxide (NO) analgesia. Document [4] mentions that Nitrous Oxide is administered in hospitals by means of an automated relative analgesia machine, with an anaesthetic vaporiser and a medical ventilator, that delivers a precisely dosed and breath-actuated flow of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen in a 2:1 ratio. This means that for every 2 parts of Nitrous Oxide, there is 1 part of Oxygen. Therefore, the concentration of Oxygen in this mixture is 33.33%, which is more than all the given options. However, since we need to find the minimum concentration, we should choose the highest option that is less than 33.33%, which is 30%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
