    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has deep carious lesions in multiple teeth but is not experiencing any pain. This suggests that the pulp of the teeth is still vital and not infected. Therefore, a root canal treatment (RCT) or extraction of the teeth, which are more invasive procedures, may not be necessary at this stage. Pulpotomy is usually performed when there is a pulp exposure or the pulp is infected, which does not seem to be the case here. Indirect pulp capping is a procedure that is used to stimulate the healing and reparative capacity of the pulp after it has been slightly exposed due to caries removal. This procedure is less invasive and aims to preserve the pulp vitality, which seems to be the most appropriate treatment plan for this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
