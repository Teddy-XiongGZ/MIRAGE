    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The number of patients required in a clinical trial is determined by several factors. One of these factors is the significance level. The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, it's the probability of making a Type I error. If the significance level increases, it means that we are more tolerant of making a Type I error, and thus, we would need fewer patients to achieve this level of significance. Therefore, the number of patients required in a clinical trial would decrease, not increase, as the significance level increases. Hence, option B is incorrect. The drop-out rate (option A) and the incidence of the disease (option D) are not directly related to the number of patients required in a clinical trial. The size of the expected treatment effect (option C), however, is directly related to the number of patients required in a clinical trial. If the expected treatment effect is small, we would need a larger number of patients to detect this effect. Therefore, the number of patients required in a clinical trial would increase as the size of the expected treatment effect decreases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
