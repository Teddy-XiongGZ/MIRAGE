    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Compression of bone is a mechanical stress that bone tissue can resist due to its structure and composition. The documents mention that bone is resistant to compression, but they do not specify which component of the bone is responsible for this resistance. However, Document [0] mentions that the hierarchical arrangement of collagen and mineral into bone tissue maximizes fracture resistance. Document [1] also mentions that cortical bone, which is rich in mineral content, is very resistant to compression. Document [2] also mentions that bone has a high compressive strength. Therefore, it can be inferred that the mineral component of the bone is responsible for resisting compression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Mineral component\"}"
