    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anodontia is a genetic disorder, as mentioned in Document [1]. However, none of the documents provided specify whether it is X linked dominant, X linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or polygenic. Document [10] mentions that if Anodontia is present in the maternal or paternal side, the chances of this being inherited are increased, which suggests it could be autosomal dominant. However, this is not definitive. Document [19] mentions that anodontia, hypodontia, and oligodontia have the same etiology, and the phenotypic appearance of each depends on the severity of the underlying etiology. The suggested etiology for the failure of teeth to develop has been linked to 15 causative genes in non-syndromic cases. This suggests that anodontia could be polygenic, as multiple genes are involved.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Polygenic\"}"
