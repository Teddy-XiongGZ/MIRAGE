It ends in a tendon which winds around the pterygoid hamulus and then passes medially and is inserted into the palatine aponeurosis and into the surface behind the transverse ridge on the horizontal part of the palatine bone as stated in Document [1] and Document [2]. Based on this information, the correct answer is: A. Origin Greater wing of sphenoid and scaphoid fossa; Insertion as palatine aponeurosis into posterior hard palate.
