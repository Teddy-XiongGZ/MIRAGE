    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the section of the Criminal Procedure Code that allows the high court to stay the execution of a pregnant woman. None of the documents provided mention a specific section of the Criminal Procedure Code that directly answers this question. However, Document [0] mentions that pregnant women may not be sentenced to death in Malaysia, and their sentences would be reduced to life imprisonment as provided by Section 275 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This does not directly answer the question but gives some context about how the law treats pregnant women in capital cases. Without more specific information in the documents, I cannot definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not provided in the documents\"}"
