    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a specialized connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. When a tooth loses its antagonist, the tooth is no longer subjected to the normal forces of occlusion. This lack of function can lead to changes in the PDL. According to Document [18], a reduction in the mechanical strength of the PDL in a hypofunctional rat molar is closely associated with the progressive atrophy of the PDL. This suggests that the PDL space may widen when a tooth loses its antagonist. Document [28] also mentions that traumatic occlusion may cause a widening of the PDL space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
