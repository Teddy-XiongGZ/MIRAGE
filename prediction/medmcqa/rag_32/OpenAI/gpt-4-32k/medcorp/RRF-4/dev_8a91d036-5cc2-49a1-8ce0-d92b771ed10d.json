    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that there are two types of nerve fibers in the pulp: A-fibers and C-fibers. A-fibers are further divided into A-delta and A-beta fibers. According to Document [22], A-fibers are responsible for sharp, well-localized pain, which is the type of pain described in the question. Therefore, the A-fibers, specifically the A-delta fibers, are the ones that are stimulated to detect pain using an electric nerve tester and in cases of reversible pulpitis and pulp hyperemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. A delta\"}"
