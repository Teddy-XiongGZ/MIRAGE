    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the maximum torque that should not be exceeded during implant placement. From the documents, it is clear that the torque value plays a significant role in the success of the implant. However, the exact maximum torque value is not universally agreed upon. Document [0] mentions high torque as equal or higher than 50 Ncm. Document [2] mentions forces \u226530 Ncm are routinely used and increased insertion torque (\u226550 Ncm) does not appear to damage bone. Document [5] mentions high insertion torques up to 70 N/cm did not significantly increase bone resorption around implants. Document [6] recommends the insertion torque to be within the range from 5 to 10 N cm. Document [7] mentions that in soft bone, it was not possible to reach peak insertion torque above 35 N/cm. Document [10] mentions that there seems to be no correlation between insertion torque and implant failure above 35 Ncm threshold of insertion torque. Document [17] mentions that to achieve osseointegration, it was found that an insertion torque above 32 Ncm was necessary. Document [18] mentions that Aarhus and tomas-pin mini-implants displayed torque ratios \u2265 75% and experienced fracture upon insertion. Document [22] mentions that the increase in insertion torque reduces the amount of micromotions between implant and bone. Therefore, the immediate loading may be considered a valid therapeutic choice, even in low-density bone, as long as at least 45 N/cm of insertion torque is reached. Document [25] mentions that the male clinicians produced more statistically significantly accurate torque value (34.54 \u00b1 3.78 N cm) than the female clinicians. Document [30] mentions that the aim of this study is to verify if the Insertion Torque Value (ITV) of 32 Ncm for immediate loading protocol (ILP), as indicated by literature, is still, with the advance in implant research, a real significant cut-off for long-term implant survival. Considering all these documents, it seems that the maximum torque should not be above 70 N.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
