    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, the T stage is determined by the size of the primary tumor. In this case, the patient has a lesion of 2.5*3.5 cm on the lateral border of the tongue. This falls into the T2 category, which is defined as a tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension. The N stage is determined by the presence of regional lymph node metastasis. In this case, the patient has no associated lymphadenopathy, which corresponds to N0. The M stage is determined by the presence of distant metastasis. As there is no information given about distant metastasis, we can assume it is M0. Therefore, the patient's cancer stage according to the 8th AJCC guidelines is T2N0M0.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
