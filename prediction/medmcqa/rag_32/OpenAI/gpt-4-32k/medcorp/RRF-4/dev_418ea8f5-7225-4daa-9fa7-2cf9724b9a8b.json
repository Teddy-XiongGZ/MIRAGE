    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's complaint is about food sticking in the interproximal area, which is the space between two teeth. This could be due to the contact area of the amalgam restoration. The contact area is the part of the restoration that touches the adjacent tooth. If the contact area is too wide occlusogingivally, it could lead to food impaction because it would not allow the normal self-cleansing action of saliva and the tongue.
