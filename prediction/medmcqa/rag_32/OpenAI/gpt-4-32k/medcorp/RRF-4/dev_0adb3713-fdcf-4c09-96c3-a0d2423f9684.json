    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a tool used to assess and calculate a patient's level of consciousness. It consists of three components: eye response, verbal response, and motor response. Each component is evaluated separately and the scores are then added together to give a total score. According to the documents, the eye-opening response is scored as spontaneous \u2013 4, opens to verbal command \u2013 3, opens to pain \u2013 2, and no response \u2013 1. The verbal response is scored as oriented \u2013 5, confused \u2013 4, inappropriate responses \u2013 3, incomprehensible sounds \u2013 2, and no response \u2013 1. The motor response is scored as obeys commands \u2013 6, spontaneous movement or localizes to painful stimuli \u2013 5, withdrawal from pain \u2013 4, abnormal flexion (decorticate) \u2013 3, abnormal extension (decerebrate) \u2013 2, and no response \u2013 1. In the case of an intubated patient, the verbal response is not testable and is given a score of 1T. In this case, the patient has an eye response of 2 (opens to pain), a verbal response of 1T (intubated), and a motor response of 3 (abnormal flexion). Therefore, the GCS score would be E2V1TM3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
