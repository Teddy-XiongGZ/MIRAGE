    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with patchy hair loss, which is a common feature in alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, and trichotillomania. However, the presence of non-scarring alopecia with multiple small broken hairs is more indicative of trichotillomania. The histological findings of mild inflammation, peri-follicular hemorrhage, and surrounding mild lymphocytic infiltration also support this diagnosis. Alopecia areata typically presents with a more pronounced lymphocytic infiltrate, and androgenic alopecia is usually associated with miniaturization of hair follicles. Loose anagen hair syndrome is characterized by easily pluckable hair in the absence of scalp inflammation or scarring, which is not the case here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Trichotillomania\"}"
