    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelopathy refers to any neurologic deficit related to the spinal cord. It can present with various symptoms including sensory loss, but this typically affects areas below the level of spinal cord compression, not the facial area which is innervated by cranial nerves. Therefore, sensory loss of the facial area is not a typical symptom of myelopathy. Brisk jaw jerk and brisk pectoral jerk can be signs of upper motor neuron lesions, which can occur in myelopathy. Urgency and incontinence of micturition can also occur in myelopathy due to disruption of the neural pathways controlling bladder function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
