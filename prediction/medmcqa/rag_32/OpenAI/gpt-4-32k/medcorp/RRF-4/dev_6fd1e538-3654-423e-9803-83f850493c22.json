    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resting membrane potential of a cell is determined by the ions to which the cell membrane is permeable. In this case, the cell membrane is permeable to three ions: X, Y, and Z. The equilibrium potentials of X and Y are given, but the equilibrium potential of Z is not mentioned. If a drug is infused that blocks the permeability of Z, then Z will no longer contribute to the resting membrane potential. The membrane potential will then be determined by the ions X and Y only. Since the equilibrium potentials of X and Y are not changing, the membrane potential will not change either.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. No change\"}"
