    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Contrast-induced nephropathy is a condition that can occur following the administration of contrast agents, often used in medical imaging procedures. According to the documents, several risk factors are associated with this condition. Document [3] mentions that preexisting renal failure, especially when secondary to diabetic nephropathy, is a major risk factor. Document [4] suggests that there is a lower risk of contrast-induced nephropathy when low osmolar contrast media is used, implying that high osmolar agents could increase the risk. Document [6] lists dehydration as a risk factor. However, none of the documents mention obesity as a risk factor for contrast-induced nephropathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Obesity\"}"
