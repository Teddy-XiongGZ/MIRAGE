    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each type of cancer is. Osteosarcoma is a type of primary bone cancer, which means it originates in the bone. Metastatic bone cancer, on the other hand, is a secondary cancer, meaning it originates in another part of the body and then spreads to the bone. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the bone marrow, and squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can metastasize to the bones. Now, I need to determine which of these is the most common. According to Document [1], secondary bone tumors are 50 to 100 times as common as primary bone cancers. This suggests that metastatic bone cancer is more common than osteosarcoma. Document [17] also states that bone metastasis is much more common than primary bone cancers in adults. Therefore, the most common bone cancer is metastatic bone cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
