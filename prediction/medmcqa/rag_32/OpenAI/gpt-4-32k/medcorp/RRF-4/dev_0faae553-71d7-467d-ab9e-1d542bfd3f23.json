    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The AO system of fixation is a method used for treating fractures. The term 'buttressing' in the context of bone fractures refers to the use of a support or brace to stabilize the fracture. When adequate bone buttressing is present, it means that the fracture is well supported and stabilized. According to the principles of the AO system, when a fracture is well stabilized, it can share the load, meaning that the forces exerted on the bone are distributed across the fracture site, rather than being concentrated at one point. This is known as load sharing fixation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Load sharing fixation\"}"
