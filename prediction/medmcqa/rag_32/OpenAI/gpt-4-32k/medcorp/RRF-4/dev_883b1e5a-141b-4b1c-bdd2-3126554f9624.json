    "Step 1: Aneuploidy is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell. It is a common cause of some genetic disorders and is also found in some cancer cells. Most cases of aneuploidy in the autosomes result in miscarriage. Step 2: The most common extra autosomal chromosomes among live births are 21, 18 and 13. Chromosome abnormalities are detected in 1 of 160 live human births. Step 3: The most frequent aneuploidy in humans is trisomy 16 and fetuses affected with the full version of this chromosome abnormality do not survive to term. The most common aneuploidy that infants can survive with is trisomy 21, which is found in Down syndrome, affecting 1 in 800 births. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) affects 1 in 6,000 births, and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) affects 1 in 10,000 births. 10% of infants with trisomy 18 or 13 reach 1 year of age. Step 4: Aneuploidy is the most prevalent chromosome abnormality in humans (developing in 5 to 10% of all pregnancies) and is the leading genetic cause of miscarriage and congenital defects. Step 5: Aneuploidy (trisomy or monosomy) is the most commonly identified chromosome abnormality in humans, occurring in at least 5% of all clinically recognized pregnancies. Most aneuploid conceptuses perish in utero, which makes this the leading genetic cause of pregnancy loss. From the above steps, it is clear that the occurrence of aneuploidy has a relation with the progression of the mother's age. Therefore, the statement \"Occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age\" is not true about aneuploidy. So, the answer is C. \"Occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age\".
