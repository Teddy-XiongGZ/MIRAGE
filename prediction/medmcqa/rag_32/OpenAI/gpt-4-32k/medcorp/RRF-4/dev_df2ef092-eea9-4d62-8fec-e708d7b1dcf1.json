    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [23] states that antero-mesial resection, a type of epileptic surgery, can result in complete seizure remission rates of up to 80% in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis and unilateral seizures. Document [26] also supports the effectiveness of epileptic surgery, stating that about two-thirds of patients become seizure-free, compared to only 8% with medical therapy. Document [27] also reports that hypothalamic hamartomas-related seizures may be controlled by simple disconnection, a surgical procedure. On the other hand, documents discussing other treatment modalities such as deep brain stimulation (Document [9]), vagal stimulation (Document [14]), and ketogenic diet (Document [30]) do not provide such high rates of seizure-free periods. Therefore, epileptic surgery seems to be the most effective treatment modality for medically intractable seizures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
