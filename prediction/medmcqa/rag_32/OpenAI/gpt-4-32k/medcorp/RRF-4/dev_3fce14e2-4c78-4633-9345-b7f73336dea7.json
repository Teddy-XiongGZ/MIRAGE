    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several times that adding sodium bicarbonate to local anaesthetics can increase the speed and quality of anaesthesia. For example, Document [2] states that sodium bicarbonate reduces the time to onset of anaesthesia and reduces pain on injection. Document [1] also mentions that buffering local anaesthetics with sodium bicarbonate significantly reduces the pain of injection and retains the efficacy of local anaesthetics. There is no mention in the documents of sodium bicarbonate decreasing the diffusion of the anaesthetic drug, causing rapid elimination of the local anaesthetic, or decreasing the speed and quality of anaesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
