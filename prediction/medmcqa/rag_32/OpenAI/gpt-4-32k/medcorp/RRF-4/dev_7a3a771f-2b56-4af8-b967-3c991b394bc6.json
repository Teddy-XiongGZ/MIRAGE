    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) both exert their anticoagulant effects by enhancing the inhibition of serine proteases by antithrombin III. However, LMWH has a more predictable anticoagulant effect than UFH. This is not because it interferes with thrombin and antithrombin III simultaneously, as both UFH and LMWH do this. It is also not because it is given subcutaneously, as both UFH and LMWH can be administered this way. The clearance of LMWH is not primarily by macrophages, but rather by the kidneys. The key difference between UFH and LMWH that leads to the more predictable anticoagulant effect of LMWH is that LMWH is less protein bound than UFH. This results in a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile, including better bioavailability and a longer half-life.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
