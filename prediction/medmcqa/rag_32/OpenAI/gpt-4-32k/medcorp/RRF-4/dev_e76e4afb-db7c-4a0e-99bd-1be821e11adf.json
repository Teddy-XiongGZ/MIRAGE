    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An ecological study is a type of observational study that measures variables in a population over a specific time period. In this case, the sale of anti-asthma drugs and the number of deaths due to asthma were measured over a 15-year period, which fits the definition of an ecological study. A case reference study is not a recognized type of study in epidemiology. An experimental study involves the manipulation of variables in a controlled setting, which is not the case here. Psephology is the study of elections and voting, which is not relevant to this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
