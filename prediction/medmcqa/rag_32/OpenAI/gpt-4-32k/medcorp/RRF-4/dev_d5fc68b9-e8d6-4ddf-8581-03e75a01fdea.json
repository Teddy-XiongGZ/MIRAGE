    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neuronal migration disorders are a category of developmental brain disorders leading to cortical dysplasia. Lissencephaly, Schizencephaly, and Polymicrogyria are all conditions that are associated with abnormal neuronal migration and organization, as mentioned in the documents. However, Focal cortical dysplasia without balloon cells is a specific subtype of cortical dysplasia that is characterized by the presence of dysmorphic neurons without the presence of balloon cells, which are a hallmark of other types of cortical dysplasia. This suggests that this subtype of cortical dysplasia may not be directly linked to abnormal neuronal migration and organization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
