    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most important but nonspecific regulator of iron metabolism. Looking at the documents, hepcidin is mentioned multiple times as a key regulator of iron metabolism. For example, Document 10 states that 'the hepatic peptide hepcidin was identified as the systemic iron-regulatory hormone.' Document 24 also mentions that 'Hepcidin, the key iron-regulating peptide binds to the iron exporter ferroportin and leads to its degradation, thereby inhibiting intestinal iron absorption and cellular export.' These statements suggest that hepcidin plays a crucial role in regulating iron metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
