However, Document 28 states that the size of the diaphragmatic defect seems to be the major factor influencing outcome in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. It is likely that the defect size is a surrogate marker for the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia.

Therefore, the size of the hernia appears to be the most important prognostic factor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
