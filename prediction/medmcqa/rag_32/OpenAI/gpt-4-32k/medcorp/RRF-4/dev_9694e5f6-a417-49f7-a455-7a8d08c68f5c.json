    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is primarily involved in the regulation of fluid balance in the body. According to Document [14], ADH functions to increase free water reabsorption in the collecting duct of the nephrons within the kidney, causing an increase in plasma volume. Document [18] also states that ADH binds to V2 receptors on the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidney to up-regulate aquaporin channel expression on the basolateral membrane and increase water reabsorption. Therefore, the primary site of action of ADH is on the distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
