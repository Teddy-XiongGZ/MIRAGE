    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The binder in dental castings is used to hold the ingredients together and provide rigidity to the investment. This is mentioned in Document [0] where it talks about SiO2 and MgO being used as refractory materials in the investment, and in Document [1] where it talks about the binder in the investment being 30% of the composition. The binder does not bring about reduction in expansion, as expansion is usually caused by the heating process, not the binder. The binder is not usually a form of silica, as silica is typically used as a refractory material, not a binder. The binder can be safely heated above 700\u00b0C when present in the form of gypsum, as mentioned in Document [24].\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
