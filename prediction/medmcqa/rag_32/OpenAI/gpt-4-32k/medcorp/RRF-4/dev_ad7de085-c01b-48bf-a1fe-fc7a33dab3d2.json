    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the kidneys. The documents mention several methods of diagnosing this condition. A histopathological examination involves studying tissues under a microscope, which can provide a definitive diagnosis but is invasive. The leucocyte esterase test and nitrite test are urine tests that can indicate a urinary tract infection, but they are not specific to pyelonephritis. Bacteria in gram stain is a method of identifying bacteria, but it is not specific to pyelonephritis either. However, the document [0] mentions that the level of urinary TNF-alpha-creatinine ratio is acutely increased in pyelonephritis and it decreases after appropriate therapy with a high sensitivity for early diagnosis of the disease. This suggests that a histopathological examination might be the most specific investigation for acute pyelonephritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
