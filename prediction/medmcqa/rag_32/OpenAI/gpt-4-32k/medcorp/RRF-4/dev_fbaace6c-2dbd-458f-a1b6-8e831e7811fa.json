    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to a physiological phenomenon where a substance that usually causes vasoconstriction instead causes vasodilation, or vice versa. This is typically observed when a blocking agent is administered before the vasoactive substance. In this case, the blocking agent is propranolol, a beta-blocker, and the vasoactive substances are adrenaline and noradrenaline. Propranolol blocks the effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline on beta-adrenergic receptors, which are involved in vasodilation. Therefore, if propranolol is administered before adrenaline or noradrenaline, it would block their usual vasodilatory effect, leading to vasoconstriction instead. This is the vasomotor reversal of Dale. Therefore, the correct answer should involve the administration of propranolol before either adrenaline or noradrenaline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Propranolol followed by adrenaline\"}"
