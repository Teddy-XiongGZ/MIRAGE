    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set certain criteria for assessing the adequacy of sperms for fertilization. These criteria include sperm count, sperm motility, semen volume, and sperm morphology. However, the documents suggest that there is some debate about which of these parameters is the most useful. Document [1] suggests that sperm morphology and the number of morphologically normal spermatozoa are the best predictors of IVF outcome. Document [8] also suggests that strict criteria morphology predicts fertilization, while other semen parameters do not. Document [11] suggests that the concentration of progressively motile sperm has consistently been shown to be the most predictive factor with regard to outcome. Document [19] suggests that sperm vitality and sperm concentration bear the most significant relation to pregnancy. However, Document [23] suggests that sperm concentration and rapid progressive motility appear to have a high impact on fertility. Therefore, based on these documents, it seems that sperm morphology and motility are the most useful parameters in assessing the adequacy of sperms for fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Spermatocyte motility\"}"
