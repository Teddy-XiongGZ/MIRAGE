    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mesodermal basis of the lateral part of the lip. From Document [0], we know that the upper lip forms from the maxillary, medial nasal, and lateral nasal prominences. These facial prominences arise from ventrally migrating neural crest cells in combination with the head ectoderm and mesoderm. The initial fusion is between the lateral and medial nasal processes, followed by fusion between the maxillary and medial nasal processes. Therefore, the maxillary process, which is a part of the mesoderm, contributes to the formation of the lip.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Maxillary process.\"}"
