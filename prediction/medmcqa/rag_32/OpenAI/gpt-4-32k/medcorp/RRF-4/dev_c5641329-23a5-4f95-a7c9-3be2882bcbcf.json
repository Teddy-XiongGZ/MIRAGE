    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coagulation pathway is divided into three parts: the intrinsic pathway, the extrinsic pathway, and the common pathway. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by the activation of Factor XII, which then activates Factor XI, which in turn activates Factor IX. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by tissue factor and Factor VII. Both pathways converge at the common pathway, where Factor X is activated. Therefore, the sequence of clotting factors in the coagulation pathway is XII, XI, IX, X.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
