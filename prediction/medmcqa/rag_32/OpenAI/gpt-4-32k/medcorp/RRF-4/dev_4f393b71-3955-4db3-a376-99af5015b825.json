    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Azoospermia can be due to either testicular failure or obstruction in the vas deferens. Serum FSH, karyotyping, and testosterone levels can provide information about testicular function, but they cannot directly confirm the presence of an obstruction. On the other hand, testicular fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can provide direct evidence of spermatogenesis, which would suggest that the azoospermia is due to an obstruction if spermatogenesis is normal. Therefore, testicular FNAC would be the most direct and definitive test to differentiate between these two causes of azoospermia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
