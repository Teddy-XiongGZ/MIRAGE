    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament is a complex structure that undergoes changes with aging. According to Document [1], there is a steady and statistically significant decline of fibroblast number with age. Document [0] also mentions that oxytalan fibres in the aged group were relatively more tortuous and complex than those in the control group, implying a loss of their original elasticity. Document [2] mentions a decline in the quality and quantity of collagen fibres with age. Therefore, with aging, there is a decrease in the number of cells and a change in the quality and quantity of collagen fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
