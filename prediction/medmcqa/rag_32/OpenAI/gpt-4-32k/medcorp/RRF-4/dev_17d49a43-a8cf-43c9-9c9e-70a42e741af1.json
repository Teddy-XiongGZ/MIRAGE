    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best method to check objective pain response. From the documents, it is clear that pain response is often subjective and varies from person to person. However, there are methods to measure it more objectively. Document [0] mentions that electrical stimulators have been tested extensively and proven to be both valid and reliable for pain measurement. Document [14] also talks about using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and machine learning for the identification of a possible biomarker of pain. However, none of the documents mention the use of Facial pain scale, Knee jerk reflex, H - Reflex, or R III Reflex as methods to check objective pain response. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it is not possible to choose the best method among the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
