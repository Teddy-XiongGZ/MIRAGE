    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the conditions in which an oral screen should not be used. An oral screen is a device used to prevent self-inflicted oral trauma or to correct certain oral habits. From the documents, there is no specific mention of when not to use an oral screen. However, logically, an oral screen would not be recommended in the presence of an acute infection in the mouth or throat, such as tonsillitis or adenoiditis, as it could potentially exacerbate the infection or cause discomfort to the patient. On the other hand, conditions like nail biting, tongue thrusting, and thumb sucking are typically situations where an oral screen might be used to help correct these habits.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
