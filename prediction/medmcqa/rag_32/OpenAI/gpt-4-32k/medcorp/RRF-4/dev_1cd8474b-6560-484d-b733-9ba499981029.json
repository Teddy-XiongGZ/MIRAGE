    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about the composition of porcelain. Step 2: Document [4] provides a composition of dental feldspathic porcelain which includes silica and feldspar, but not calcium carbonate or amorphous material. Step 3: Document [2] and [10] also mention the composition of porcelain, but they do not mention calcium carbonate or amorphous material. Step 4: Based on the information provided, it seems that calcium carbonate and amorphous material are not mentioned as components of porcelain. The answer is not clear between options C and D. However, considering that porcelain is a type of ceramic and ceramics are typically crystalline rather than amorphous, it is more likely that amorphous material is not present in porcelain. Therefore, the answer is D. Amorphous material. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first reviewed the documents for information about the composition of porcelain.
