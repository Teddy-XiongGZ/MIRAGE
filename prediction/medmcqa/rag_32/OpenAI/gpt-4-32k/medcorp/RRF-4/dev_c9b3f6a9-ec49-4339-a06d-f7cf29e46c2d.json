    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that electronic apex locators are generally accurate in determining the working length of root canals, even in teeth with open apices. Document 25, for example, presents a tactile method for working length determination in teeth with open apices and found it to be accurate. Document 1 mentions that electronic apex locators (EALs) may be helpful in determining the working length in teeth with wide or immature apices. However, moisture on paperpoint is not mentioned as a method for determining working length in any of the documents. Therefore, the most accurate method of determination of working length in a tooth with open apex would be the electronic apex locator.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
