    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the absence of a developmental milestone in a 3-year-old child that would be considered a delay. Looking at the options, I need to identify which of these milestones would typically be expected to be achieved by a 3-year-old. Hopping on one leg and drawing a square are more complex tasks that may not be expected at this age. Feeding by spoon and passing a ball to someone are simpler tasks that a 3-year-old child would typically be able to do. Therefore, if a 3-year-old child is unable to perform these tasks, it could be considered a developmental delay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Feeding by spoon\"}"
