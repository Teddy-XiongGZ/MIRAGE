    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystinuria is a disease that involves the defective transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the kidney and intestine, leading to the formation of cystine stones in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. This is due to the high concentrations of the amino acid cystine in the urine, which is poorly soluble and can precipitate out of the urine to form crystals or stones. Therefore, the characteristic feature of cystinuria is the recurrent formation of urinary calculi or kidney stones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Recurrent urinary caliculi\"}"
