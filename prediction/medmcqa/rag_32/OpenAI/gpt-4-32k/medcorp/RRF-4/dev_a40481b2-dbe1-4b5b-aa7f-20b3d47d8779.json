    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malignant hyperpyrexia is a condition that can be triggered by certain anesthetic agents. According to Document [0], the exact cause is unknown but it is suspected that triggering agents that release calcium from the calcium-storing sarcoplasmic membrane of the muscle cell are involved. Document [15] mentions that this condition can be triggered by certain volatile anaesthetic agents or Suxamethonium. Therefore, Suxamethonium is the anesthetic agent among the options that can cause malignant hyperpyrexia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Suxamethonium\"}"
