    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the position that can decrease excessive bleeding during oral surgery. From the documents, Document 14 and Document 11 mention the effect of patient positioning on intraoperative bleeding. Document 14 specifically mentions that the Reverse Trendelenburg position, where the patient's head is elevated, reduces intraoperative bleeding in rhinoplasty patients. Document 11 also mentions that the Reverse Trendelenburg position does not increase patient bleeding. Although these documents are not specifically about oral surgery, the principle of elevating the head to reduce bleeding could potentially apply to oral surgery as well. Therefore, the head-up position might be the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
