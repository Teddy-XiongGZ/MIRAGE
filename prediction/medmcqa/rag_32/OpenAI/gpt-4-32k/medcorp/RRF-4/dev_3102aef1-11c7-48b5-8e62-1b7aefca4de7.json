    "First, I need to understand what each of the drug types listed in the options do. Cholinergic drugs stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for rest and digest functions. Anticholinergic drugs block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that transmits signals in the nervous system. Adrenergic drugs stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the fight or flight response. Next, I need to find information in the documents that links these drug types to saliva production. Document [20] mentions that parasympathomimetic drugs, which are a type of cholinergic drug, act on parasympathetic muscarinic receptors to induce an increased saliva flow. This suggests that cholinergic drugs can increase saliva production. Therefore, the answer is A. Cholinergic drugs. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each of the drug types listed in the options do.
