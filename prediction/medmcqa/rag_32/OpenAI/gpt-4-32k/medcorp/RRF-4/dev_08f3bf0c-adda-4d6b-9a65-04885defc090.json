    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is a ribosomal binding site in prokaryotic and archaeal messenger RNA, generally located around 8 bases upstream of the start codon AUG. The sequence helps recruit the ribosome to the mRNA to initiate protein synthesis by aligning the ribosome with the start codon. This is confirmed in Document [0] and Document [12]. Therefore, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is responsible for binding mRNA with the ribosome in prokaryotes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Shine Dalgarno sequence\"}"
