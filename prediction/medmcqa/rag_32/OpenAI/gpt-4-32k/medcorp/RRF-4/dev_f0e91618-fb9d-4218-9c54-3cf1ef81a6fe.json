    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms include hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and accumulation of highly branched glycogen called limit dextrins. These symptoms are indicative of a glycogen storage disease. McArdle's disease (Glycogen storage disease type V) primarily affects the muscles and does not typically present with hepatomegaly. Von Gierke's disease (Glycogen storage disease type I) is characterized by the accumulation of normal glycogen in the liver and kidneys, not limit dextrins. Anderson's disease (Glycogen storage disease type IV) leads to the accumulation of abnormal glycogen with short outer chains, not limit dextrins. Cori's disease (Glycogen storage disease type III) is characterized by the accumulation of limit dextrins due to a deficiency in the debranching enzyme, which matches the child's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Cori's disease\"}"
