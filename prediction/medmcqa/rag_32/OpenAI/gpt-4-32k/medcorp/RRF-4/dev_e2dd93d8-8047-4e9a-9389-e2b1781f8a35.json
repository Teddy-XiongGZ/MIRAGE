    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several signs of breast cancer, including nipple retraction, peau d'orange, puckering, and cancer en-cuirasse. However, the most commonly mentioned sign across the documents is a lump or mass in the breast. This is not one of the options, so I need to consider the provided choices. Nipple retraction is mentioned in several documents as a sign of breast cancer, but it is not always present and is not the most common symptom. Peau d'orange is a sign of inflammatory breast cancer, a specific type of breast cancer, but it is not the most common sign of all breast cancers. Puckering is not mentioned frequently in the documents. Cancer en-cuirasse is not mentioned at all in the documents. Therefore, based on the information in the documents, the most conspicuous sign among the provided options is likely nipple retraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
