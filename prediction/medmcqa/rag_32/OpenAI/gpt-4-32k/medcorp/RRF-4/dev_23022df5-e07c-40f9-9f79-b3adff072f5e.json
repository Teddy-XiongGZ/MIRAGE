The X-ray is normal, but the doctor has ordered a bone scan. This suggests that the doctor is looking for a condition that might not show up on an X-ray but could be detected with a bone scan. A Jones fracture and a Lisfranc fracture are specific types of fractures that would likely show up on an X-ray. A Nutcracker is not a medical condition related to bone injuries.
