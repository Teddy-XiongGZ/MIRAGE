    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a neonate experiencing bilateral jerking of both upper limbs and occasional twitching of the neck. This suggests that multiple areas of the body are involved, which rules out focal seizures as they typically involve one specific area. The jerking and twitching described are characteristic of clonic seizures, which involve repetitive, rhythmic muscle contractions. Therefore, the seizures are likely multifocal clonic, as they involve multiple areas and exhibit clonic characteristics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Multifocal clonic\"}"
