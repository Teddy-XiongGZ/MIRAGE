    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [1] states that during electrophoresis at alkaline pH, HbS migrates more slowly toward the anode (positive electrode) than does HbA. This is due to the absence of the negatively charged glutamate residues in the two \u03b2 chains, thereby rendering HbS less negative than HbA. Therefore, the mobility of HbS as compared with normal hemoglobin on gel electrophoresis will be decreased.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
