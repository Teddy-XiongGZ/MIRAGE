    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the check point for ZMC fracture reduction. The check point refers to the location where the fixation is done to ensure the fracture is properly aligned and stable. From the documents, it is clear that multiple locations can be used for fixation, including the intraorbital margin, fronto-zygomatic suture region, and zygomatico-maxillary buttress region. However, the symmetry of the arch is not mentioned as a check point for reduction, but rather as a result or goal of the reduction. Therefore, the answer should be one of the specific anatomical locations mentioned.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
