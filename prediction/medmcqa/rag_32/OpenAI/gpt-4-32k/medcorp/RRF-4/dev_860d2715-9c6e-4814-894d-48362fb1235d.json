    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Repolarization is the process of returning the membrane potential to a negative value after the depolarization phase of an action potential. This process is primarily achieved through the efflux of potassium ions (K+) from the cell, which helps to restore the negative membrane potential. Therefore, the event closely associated with repolarization is the efflux of potassium ions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. K+ efflux\"}"
