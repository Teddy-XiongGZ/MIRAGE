    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The McRoberts maneuver involves hyperflexion of the thighs towards the abdomen. This position primarily affects the nerves in the hip and thigh region. The common peroneal nerve is located in the lower leg, so it's unlikely to be affected by this maneuver. The lumbosacral trunk is a part of the lumbosacral plexus in the lower back, which might not be directly affected by this maneuver. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh could be affected as it is located in the thigh, but it's not the most likely. The obturator nerve, which is responsible for the adduction of the thigh, is the most likely to be affected by the McRoberts maneuver as it involves movements of the thigh.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Obturator nerve\"}"
