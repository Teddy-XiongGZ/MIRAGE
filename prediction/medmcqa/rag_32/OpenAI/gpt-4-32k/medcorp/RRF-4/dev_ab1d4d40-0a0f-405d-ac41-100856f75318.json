    "First, I will look for information about the hardness of Type III gold alloy compared to Type IV. Document [3] mentions that Type III and IV alloys are used in casting of full crowns, with Type I being the softest and Type IV the hardest. This indicates that Type III is not harder than Type IV. Next, I will look for information about the use of Type III gold alloy for small inlays. I couldn't find any specific information about this in the documents. Then, I will look for information about the burnishability of Type III gold alloy compared to Type IV. Document [15] mentions that all the gold alloys have considerably lower burnishability numbers than are indicated by ADA specification No. 5 for the softened condition. In fact, they are even more burnishable in the hardened condition than specified for Type II alloys. This suggests that Type III could be more easily burnishable than Type IV. Finally, I will look for information about the gold content of Type III gold alloy compared to Type IV. Document [3] mentions that Type III and IV alloys (62 - 78% and 60 - 70% gold content respectively) are used in casting of full crowns. This indicates that Type III does not necessarily have less gold than Type IV. Based on this information, the answer is C. Easily burnishable than type IV. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I looked for information about the hardness of Type III gold alloy compared to Type IV and found that Type IV is the hardest.
