    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking which statement about glomerular capillaries is not true. Step 2: Review each answer choice in relation to the provided documents. A. The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it - Document [2] mentions that the oncotic pressure on glomerular capillaries is one of the forces that resist filtration. This suggests that the oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries could be less than that of the fluid entering it. B. Glucose concentration in the capillaries is the same as that in glomerular filtrate - None of the documents provided mention anything about the glucose concentration in the capillaries and the glomerular filtrate. However, it is known that glucose is freely filtered in the glomerulus, so the concentration could be the same. C. Constriction of afferent arteriole decreases the blood flow to the glomerulas - Document [14] mentions that the filtration rate is dependent on the difference between the higher blood pressure created by vasoconstriction of the input or afferent arteriole. This suggests that constriction of the afferent arteriole would decrease the blood flow to the glomerulas. D. Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of the fluid entering it - Document [20] mentions that of the renal blood flow (RBF), only the plasma can cross the structures comprising the glomerulus. This suggests that the hematocrit (the proportion of blood that is made up of cells) of the fluid leaving the capillaries would be less than that of the fluid entering it. Step 3: Based on the information from the documents, the statement that is not true about glomerular capillaries is B. Glucose concentration in the capillaries is the same as that in glomerular filtrate. This is because glucose is freely filtered in the glomerulus, so the concentration in the filtrate could be less than that in the capillaries. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about glomerular capillaries is not true. After reviewing each answer choice in relation to the provided documents, it appears that the statement that is not true is B.
