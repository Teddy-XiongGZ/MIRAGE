    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Causal prophylaxis refers to the prevention of the establishment of the infection in the body. This means that the drug should act before the parasite enters the blood stage, which is the erythrocytic schizogony. Therefore, the drug should act at the pre-erythrocytic schizogony stage or the exo-erythrocytic schizogony stage. The pre-erythrocytic schizogony stage refers to the development of the parasite in the liver before it enters the blood. The exo-erythrocytic schizogony stage also refers to the development of the parasite outside the red blood cells, which is also in the liver. Therefore, both options C and D are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C, D\"}"
