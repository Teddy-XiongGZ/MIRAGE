    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental plaque is formed by the reaction of enzymes on certain substances. According to Document [0], Streptococcus mutans, a bacteria present in the oral cavity, uses the enzyme glucansucrase to convert sucrose into a sticky, extracellular, dextran-based polysaccharide that allows the bacteria to cohere, forming plaque. Therefore, the enzyme acts on sucrose. There is no mention of lipids, glucose, or proteins being involved in this process. However, saliva is mentioned in Document [31] as contributing to the formation of dental plaque by providing a conditioning film on the tooth surface that facilitates bacterial colonization. Therefore, both sucrose and saliva are involved in the formation of dental plaque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sucrose and saliva\"}"
