    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cervical resorption is a serious complication that can occur after tooth bleaching. According to the documents, it is associated with high concentrations of bleaching agents and thermocatalytic techniques. Document [0] suggests that to prevent cervical resorption, it is important to avoid bleaching the cervical area of the tooth and to avoid dentin exposure. Document [1] mentions that cervical resorption was successfully treated with a calcium hydroxide procedure. Document [2] suggests that the thermocatalytic technique and high concentrations of bleaching agents should be avoided to reduce the risk of cervical root resorptions. Document [7] suggests that the use of heat should be avoided and an intermediate dental base should be placed with due respect to the attachment level. Document [23] suggests that the walking bleach technique can lead to successful whitening of non-vital root-filled teeth without the risks of side-effects. None of the documents suggest that 80% alcohol drying or alpha tocopherol applied immediately after bleaching can prevent cervical resorption. Sodium perborate + sodium hypochlorite is not mentioned as a preventive measure either. However, calcium hydroxide is mentioned as a successful treatment for cervical resorption, which suggests that it might also help in preventing it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sodium perborate + calcium hydroxide\"}"
