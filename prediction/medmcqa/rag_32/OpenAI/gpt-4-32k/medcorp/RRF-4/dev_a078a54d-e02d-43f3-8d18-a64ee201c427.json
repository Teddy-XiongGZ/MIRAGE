    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The finish line of a complete metal cast crown is the edge where the crown meets the tooth. According to Document [1], different finish lines behave differently in facilitating the escape of the cement. The document also mentions that the finish lines like shoulder preparations allow good seating. Document [18] also mentions that the shoulder and shoulder with bevel finish lines provided better crown retention than the chamfer.
