    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acid etching is a technique used in dentistry to prepare the tooth surface for bonding or sealant application. It works by creating a rougher surface on the tooth enamel, which allows for better adhesion of restorative materials. This process can help to decrease micro leakage by creating a stronger bond between the tooth and the restorative material, thus preventing gaps where bacteria could enter. The other options, such as decreasing polymerization shrinkage, decreasing coefficient of thermal expansion, and decreasing porosity in restorative material, are not directly related to the process of acid etching.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
