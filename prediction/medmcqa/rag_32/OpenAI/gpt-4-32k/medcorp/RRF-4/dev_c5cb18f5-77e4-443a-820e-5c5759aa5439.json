    "Step 1: Pseudotumor cerebri is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, normal CSF contents, and normal brain with normal or small ventricles on imaging studies (Document 1). This information confirms that options A and D are true. Step 2: Pseudotumor cerebri is a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without a space-occupying lesion (Document 22). This suggests that there are no focal neurological deficits, which confirms that option C is true. Step 3: There is no mention in the provided documents of CT scans showing punctate hypodense areas in cases of pseudotumor cerebri. Therefore, option B is likely to be false. Based on these steps, the answer is B. CT Scan shows punctate hypodense areas.
