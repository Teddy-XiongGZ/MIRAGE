    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The master apical file (MAF) is a term used in endodontics to refer to the last file used in the preparation of the root canal. It is not the initial file used for the initial radiographic working length, nor is it the smaller file used in between the other files during biomechanical preparation. It is also not specifically used for the removal of soft debris from the root canal, although it may contribute to this process. The main function of the MAF is to shape and clean the apical part of the canal, preparing it for obturation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
