    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a boy with symptoms of bleeding gums and hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints), which are common symptoms of hemophilia. Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, leading to prolonged bleeding. The fact that the boy's paternal and maternal uncles have the same problem suggests that the condition is inherited. Hemophilia is usually caused by a deficiency in either factor VIII or factor IX. Hemophilia A is caused by factor VIII deficiency and is the most common type, while Hemophilia B is caused by factor IX deficiency. The question does not provide specific information to distinguish between Hemophilia A and B. However, since Hemophilia A is more common, it is more likely that the boy has a deficiency in factor VIII.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
