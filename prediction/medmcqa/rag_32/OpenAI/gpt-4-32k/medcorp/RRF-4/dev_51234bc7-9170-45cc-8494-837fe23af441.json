    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A case control study is used when researchers want to investigate risk factors for a certain outcome, which is not the case here. An ambispective study is a combination of a retrospective and a prospective study, which might not be necessary for this research. A prospective cohort study observes a group of similar individuals who differ in certain factors under study to determine how these factors affect the rates of a certain outcome, which could be a good fit. However, a longitudinal study involves repeated observations of the same variables over a period of time, which seems to be the best fit for this study as it allows for the observation of changes in the fat content in breast milk over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
