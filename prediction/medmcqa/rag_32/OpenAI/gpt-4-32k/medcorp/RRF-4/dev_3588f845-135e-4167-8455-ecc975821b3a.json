    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the radiopacity that frequently covers the root apices of maxillary molars. Radiopacity refers to the ability of a structure to block or absorb X-rays, appearing white or light on the radiograph. The root apices of maxillary molars are located in the upper jaw, near the maxillary sinus. The maxillary sinus is a large air-filled space within the maxilla (upper jaw bone) that communicates with the nasal cavity. It is the closest anatomical structure to the root apices of maxillary molars. Therefore, it is the most likely to appear as a radiopacity over these root apices on a radiograph.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
