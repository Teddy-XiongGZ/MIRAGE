    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the suitable technique used for diagnosis of posterior interproximal caries in children. Looking at the documents, Document [1] mentions that caries lesions were diagnosed better by the X-rays than clinically, and it specifically mentions the use of bitewing X-rays. Document [7] also mentions that bitewing radiographs offer a significant advantage over periapical radiographs in the diagnoses of early stages of interproximal carious lesions. Document [12] also mentions that there was no significant difference in posterior proximal surface caries detection between the modalities, but extraoral panoramic bitewings were much better than panoramic radiographs in visualizing open posterior interproximal contacts. Document [25] also mentions that bitewing radiography with opaque material for detecting proximal cavities had a high accuracy. Therefore, it seems that bitewing radiography is the most suitable technique for diagnosing posterior interproximal caries in children. Now, looking at the options, we have three types of bitewing techniques: Bisecting angle, Paralleling, and RVG. The documents do not provide specific information about these techniques, but generally, the paralleling technique is preferred over the bisecting angle technique because it provides a more accurate image with less distortion. RVG or digital radiography also provides high-quality images and has the advantage of lower radiation exposure, but its use may depend on the availability of the equipment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Bite wing with Paralleling technique\"}"
