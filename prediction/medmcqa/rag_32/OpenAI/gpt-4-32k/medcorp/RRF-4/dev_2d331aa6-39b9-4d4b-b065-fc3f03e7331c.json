    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Local anesthetics (LAs) work by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. This means that LAs block the conductance of sodium ions from the exterior to the interior of the nerve cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
