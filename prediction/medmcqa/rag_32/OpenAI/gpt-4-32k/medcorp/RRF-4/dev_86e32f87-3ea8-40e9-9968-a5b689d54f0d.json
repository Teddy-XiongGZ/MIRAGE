    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an investigation to confirm the diagnosis of recurrent abortion in a 26-year-old woman. Recurrent abortion can be caused by various factors such as genetic, hormonal, immunological, and anatomical abnormalities. However, none of the provided options (PT, BT, Anti Russel viper venom antibodies, Clot solubility test) directly relate to these common causes of recurrent abortion. PT and BT are basic coagulation tests, but they are not specific for conditions causing recurrent abortion. Anti Russel viper venom antibodies test is used to diagnose lupus anticoagulant, a type of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which can be associated with recurrent miscarriages. Clot solubility test is used to diagnose a rare genetic disorder called Factor XIII deficiency, which can lead to recurrent miscarriages, but it is not a common cause. Therefore, among the given options, Anti Russel viper venom antibodies test would be the most relevant investigation to perform in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
