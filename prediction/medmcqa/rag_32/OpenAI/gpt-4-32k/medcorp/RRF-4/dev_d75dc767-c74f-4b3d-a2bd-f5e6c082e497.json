    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's inability to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb indicates a problem with the motor function of the hand. According to Document [1], the interosseus anterior syndrome, which affects only the motor branch of the median nerve, is characterized by paralysis of the M. flexor pollicis longus, which is responsible for flexion of the thumb. This is further supported by Document [6], which states that if there is AIN neuropraxia, the patient will be unable to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. Therefore, the most likely injured nerve is the Anterior Interosseous Nerve (AIN), which is a branch of the median nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. AIN\"}"
