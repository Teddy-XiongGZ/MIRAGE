    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question presents a case where the patient has lower natural teeth and 7 maxillary implants placed with a space of 15 mm for the restoration. The ideal treatment plan would depend on several factors including the patient's oral health, personal preferences, and financial considerations. However, given the information provided, a hybrid denture could be a suitable option.
