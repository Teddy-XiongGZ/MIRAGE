    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cleft lip and palate is a common congenital deformity. According to the documents, it is not dependent on a single factor but on many factors, suggesting that it is not monogenic. It is also not sex-linked as it affects both sexes. The documents suggest that it is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, which is characteristic of multifactorial inheritance. However, the documents also mention that multiple genes are involved in the condition, which is a characteristic of polygenic inheritance. Therefore, it seems that both polygenic and multifactorial inheritance are involved in the development of cleft lip and palate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Polygenic and C. Multifactorial\"}"
