    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells. According to Document [10], erythropoietin has its primary effect on red blood cell progenitors and precursors, which include CFU-E, proerythroblast and basophilic erythroblast subsets. The burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells start erythropoietin receptor expression and are sensitive to erythropoietin. The subsequent stage, the colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E), expresses maximal erythropoietin receptor density and is completely dependent on erythropoietin for further differentiation. Precursors of red cells, the proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts also express erythropoietin receptor and are therefore affected by it. Therefore, erythropoietin acts on all the options provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A, B, C, D\"}"
