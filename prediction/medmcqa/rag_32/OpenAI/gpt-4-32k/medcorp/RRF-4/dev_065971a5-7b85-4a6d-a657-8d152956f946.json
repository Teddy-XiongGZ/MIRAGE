    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a measure of the fluid pressure inside the eye. Certain medications can help lower this pressure. Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that can lower IOP (Document 1). Mannitol is a type of sugar alcohol that can lower IOP by reducing the volume of intraocular fluid (Document 11). Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can lower IOP by reducing the production of intraocular fluid (Document 15). Dexamethasone, on the other hand, is a type of corticosteroid. While it has many uses in medicine, it does not have a direct IOP-lowering effect. In fact, prolonged use of corticosteroids can actually increase IOP (Document 7).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
