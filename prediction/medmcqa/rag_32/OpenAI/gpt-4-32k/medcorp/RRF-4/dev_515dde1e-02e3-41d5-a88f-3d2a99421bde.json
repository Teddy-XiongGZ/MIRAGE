    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel is the hardest tissue in the human body and is formed on the tooth while the tooth develops within the jaw bone before it erupts into the mouth. Once fully formed, enamel does not contain blood vessels or nerves, and is not made of cells. This is stated in Document [3]. Furthermore, Document [15] mentions that the enamel is made before a tooth erupts into the mouth by the enamel organ, which contains cells called ameloblasts. These cells die once the tooth erupts, which means that the ability to make enamel is forever lost once eruption occurs. Therefore, the reason enamel has no capacity of self-repair is because its formative cells are lost once it is completely formed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
