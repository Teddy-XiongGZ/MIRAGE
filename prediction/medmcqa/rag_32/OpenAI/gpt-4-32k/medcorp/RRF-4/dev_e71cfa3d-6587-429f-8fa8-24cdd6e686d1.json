    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the next step after enlarging the apical constriction to a 50 sized instrument during biomechanical preparation. The goal of biomechanical preparation is to clean and shape the root canal for obturation. After enlarging the apical constriction, the next logical step would be to fit a gutta-percha cone for obturation. The size of the cone should match the size of the last instrument used in the canal preparation, which in this case is a 50 sized instrument.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Fit a 50 mm cone and condense carefully\"}"
