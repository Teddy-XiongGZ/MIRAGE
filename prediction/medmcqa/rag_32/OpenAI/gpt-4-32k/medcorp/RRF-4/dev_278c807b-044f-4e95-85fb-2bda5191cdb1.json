    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanical advantage to prevent proximal displacement of the restoration in a MO cavity prepared for inlay. From the documents, it is clear that the preparation of opposing cavity walls should be cut in a way to avoid undercuts in order to gain optimum retention from the cavity shape for the indirect restoration. This suggests that parallel walls would provide a mechanical advantage in preventing the proximal displacement of the restoration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
