    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The PCL, or posterior cruciate ligament, is a key ligament within the knee that provides stability. It is not an extra synovial structure, but rather an intra-articular structure, as it is located within the knee joint (Document [0]). The PCL is indeed a primary restraint for posterior dislocation of the knee joint, preventing the tibia from moving too far backward (Document [0]). The PCL does not primarily restrain internal rotation around the knee joint, this is more the function of the anterior cruciate ligament and other structures in the knee (Document [29]). The PCL is attached to the lateral femoral condyle, not the medial femoral condyle (Document [2]). Therefore, the statement that the PCL is attached to the medial femoral condyle is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
