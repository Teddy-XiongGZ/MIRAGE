    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to an enzyme at a site other than the active site, which changes the shape of the enzyme and prevents it from binding to its substrate. This type of inhibition affects the maximum rate of reaction (Vmax) because even with high substrate concentrations, not all of the enzyme molecules are available for reaction. However, it does not affect the Km value, which is a measure of the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. Therefore, the effect of acetazolamide, a non-competitive inhibitor, should be a decrease in Vmax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
