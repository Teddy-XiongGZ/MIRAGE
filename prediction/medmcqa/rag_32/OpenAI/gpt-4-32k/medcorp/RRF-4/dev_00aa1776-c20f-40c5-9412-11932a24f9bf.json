    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Strain is a term used in physics to describe the deformation of an object due to an applied force. It is not the force itself, but the result of the force. Therefore, options A, C, and D are incorrect because they refer to forces, not the result of the force. Option B correctly describes strain as a deformation resulting from an applied load.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
