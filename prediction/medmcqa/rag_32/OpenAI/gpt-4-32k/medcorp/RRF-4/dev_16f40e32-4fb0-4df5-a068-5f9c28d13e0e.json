    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the source of persistent endodontic infection that is extra-radicular, meaning it is outside the root canal system. Document [2] mentions that Enterococcus faecalis is one of the main causes of recurring apical periodontal lesions following endodontic treatment, with persistent lesions occurring even after re-treatment. Document [3] also mentions that Enterococcus faecalis is a common cause of endodontic failure. Document [14] mentions Propionibacterium propionicus as a species frequently involved in persistent radicular and extra-radicular infections. However, the documents do not mention V.parvula or T.denticola as sources of persistent endodontic infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. E.fecalis\"}"
