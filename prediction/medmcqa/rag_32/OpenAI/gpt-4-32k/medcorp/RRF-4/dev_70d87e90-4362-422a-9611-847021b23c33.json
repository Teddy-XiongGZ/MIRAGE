    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the first enzyme to rise in the event of a myocardial infarction. From the documents, it is clear that several enzymes are associated with myocardial infarction, including CPK (creatine phosphokinase), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), and SGOT (aspartate aminotransferase). However, according to Document [28], cytoplasmic enzymes such as CPK start to rise at 12-24 hours after the onset of myocardial infarction. This makes CPK the first enzyme to rise among the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
