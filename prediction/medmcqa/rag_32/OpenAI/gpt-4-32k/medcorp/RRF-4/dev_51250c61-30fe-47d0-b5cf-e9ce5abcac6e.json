    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-sectional studies are a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population, or a representative subset, at a specific point in time. They are often used to assess the prevalence of acute or chronic conditions. They do not follow the same individuals over time, which eliminates option C. They also do not necessarily focus on individuals of the same age, which eliminates option A. They can include different individuals from different age groups, but they do not necessarily have to, which makes option D not entirely accurate. Therefore, the best answer is option B, as cross-sectional studies can include different individuals from the same age groups.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
