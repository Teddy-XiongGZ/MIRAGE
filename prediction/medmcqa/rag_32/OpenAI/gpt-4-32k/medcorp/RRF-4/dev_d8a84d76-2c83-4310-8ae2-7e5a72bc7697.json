    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The penetration of the fissure sealant into the fissure is an important step in the process of sealing the fissure. This penetration is influenced by several factors. The wettability of the enamel, which is determined by the chemical composition of the enamel, plays a crucial role in the penetration of the sealant. The sealant must penetrate the fissure before it is polymerized, or hardened. Therefore, the answer is that the penetration must occur before the polymerization of the material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
