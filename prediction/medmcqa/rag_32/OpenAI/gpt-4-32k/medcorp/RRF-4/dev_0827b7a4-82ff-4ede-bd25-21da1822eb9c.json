    "Step 1: Identify the key information in the question. The question is asking about the mechanism of contraction in skeletal muscles. Step 2: Review the relevant documents. Document [13] mentions skeletal muscle contraction but does not provide specific details. Document [17] mentions that contraction in skeletal muscle is stimulated by electrical impulses, but does not mention the role of calcium. Document [28] mentions that the mechanisms of contraction in skeletal muscle are similar to those in smooth and cardiac muscles, but does not provide specific details. Step 3: Recall general knowledge about muscle contraction. In skeletal muscle, contraction is initiated when calcium ions bind to the protein troponin, causing a conformational change that allows the myosin heads to bind to actin and initiate contraction. This is a well-known fact in physiology and is likely the correct answer. Step 4: Match the recalled knowledge with the provided choices. The description in step 3 matches with choice C. Based on these steps, the correct answer is C. Contraction is initiated by calcium binding to troponin. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism of contraction in skeletal muscles.
