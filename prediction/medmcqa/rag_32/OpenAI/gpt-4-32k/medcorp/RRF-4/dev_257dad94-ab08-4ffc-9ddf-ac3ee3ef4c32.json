    "The step-by-step thinking process would be as follows: 1. The question is asking about the occlusion of guiding cusps. 2. From Document [3], it is mentioned that the maxillary buccal cusp and the mandibular lingual cusps guide the mandible during the lateral excursion. However, it does not specify where these guiding cusps occlude. 3. Document [16] provides a clear answer. It states that in normal occlusion, the palatine cusps of the upper molars and premolars occlude in the fossa of lower molars and premolars. The fossa of the lower molars and premolars is also known as the buccal groove. 4. Therefore, the guiding cusps occlude in the buccal groove. The answer in JSON format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the occlusion of guiding cusps.
