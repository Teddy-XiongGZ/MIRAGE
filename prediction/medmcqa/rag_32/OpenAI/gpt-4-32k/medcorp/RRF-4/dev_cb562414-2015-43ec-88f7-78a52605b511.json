    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. It works by stimulating alpha and beta receptors in the body. Alpha-receptors are located on the blood vessels and their stimulation causes vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure. Beta-receptors are located in the heart and lungs. Stimulation of beta-receptors in the heart increases heart rate and contractility, improving cardiac output. Stimulation of beta-receptors in the lungs causes bronchodilation, improving airflow. However, presynaptic alpha-receptors are not involved in the management of anaphylaxis. These receptors are found in the nerve endings and their stimulation inhibits the release of norepinephrine, reducing sympathetic activity. This action is not observed in the management of anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
