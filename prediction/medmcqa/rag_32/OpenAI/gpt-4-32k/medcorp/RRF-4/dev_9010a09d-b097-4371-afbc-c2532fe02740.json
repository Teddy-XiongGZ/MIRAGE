    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phase-contrast microscopy is a technique that enhances the contrast in unstained samples. It exploits the fact that light waves change phase when they pass through a material. This phase shift is caused by the difference in refractive index between the material and its surrounding medium. Therefore, the principle of phase-contrast microscopy is based on the different refractive indices of the object.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
