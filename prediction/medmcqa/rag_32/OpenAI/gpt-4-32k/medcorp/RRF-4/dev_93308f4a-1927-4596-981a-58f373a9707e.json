    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity of a cement is important for supporting an amalgam restoration. According to Document [0], the strength of the restorations varied with the type of base. Zinc phosphate cement is equal to no base and superior to zinc phosphate cement plus Dycal, which is equal to Dycal. Dycal is superior to Cavitec, which is the same as Cavitec plus Dycal. The amalgam restorations were stronger over a base with a higher modulus of elasticity, indicating that modulus of elasticity of a base is more important than compressive strength in supporting an amalgam restoration. Document [1] also states that modulus elasticity of cement plays an important role in affecting the fracture strength of the amalgam restored tooth. From the point of mechanical property, zinc phosphate is one of the best dental cements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Zinc phosphate\"}"
