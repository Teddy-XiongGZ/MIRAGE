    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about the age group for which the Japanese encephalitis vaccine is given. Step 2: Look for information about the number of primary doses given to children in the one to three year age group. Step 3: Search for information about the frequency of booster doses. Step 4: Check for information about the age group covered for vaccination in endemic areas. After reviewing the documents, it is clear that the Japanese encephalitis vaccine is given to children and adults, but there is no specific mention of it not being given to infants less than 6 months (Choice A). There is also no specific information about two primary doses being given to children in the one to three year age group (Choice B). Document 7 mentions that booster vaccinations are given, but it does not specify the frequency (Choice C). Document 17 mentions that vaccination programs have been conducted for children in endemic areas, but it does not specify the age group (Choice D). Based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively say which statement is not true. However, since there is no specific mention of the vaccine not being given to infants less than 6 months, Choice A seems to be the most likely answer. Therefore, the answer is A. Not given for infants less than 6 months. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Review the documents for information about the age group for which the Japanese encephalitis vaccine is given.
