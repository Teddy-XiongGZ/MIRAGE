    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity, also known as Young's modulus, is a measure of the stiffness of a material. It is defined as the ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain. This means it measures how a material deforms under stress, but only in the elastic region where the material returns to its original shape once the stress is removed. Therefore, it does not measure the ability to be stretched with permanent deformation, which would be plastic deformation, not elastic. It also does not directly measure ductility or malleability, which are other properties of materials related to their ability to deform under stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
