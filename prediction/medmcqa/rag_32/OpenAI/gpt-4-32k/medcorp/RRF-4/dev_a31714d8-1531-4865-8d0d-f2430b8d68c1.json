    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Toxic shock syndrome is a condition caused by bacterial toxins. According to Document [3], Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) is a superantigen produced by Staphylococcus aureus isolates. It causes toxic shock syndrome (TSS) by stimulating the release of large amounts of interleukin-1, interleukin-2 and tumour necrosis factor. Document [6] also mentions that one of the major virulence exotoxins is the toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST), which is secreted by the organism upon successful invasion. It causes a major inflammatory response in the host via superantigenic properties, and is the causative agent of toxic shock syndrome. Therefore, the virulence factor responsible for toxic shock syndrome is the pyrogenic exotoxin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pyrogenic exotoxin\"}"
