    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the color code of an extremely hazardous insecticide according to the WHO classification. From Document [0], it is clear that the WHO doesn't use a color coding system for toxicity classification. However, the Indian standardized system of toxicity labels for pesticides uses a 4-color system. But the document doesn't specify which color corresponds to which toxicity class. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it's impossible to determine the color code for an extremely hazardous insecticide according to the WHO classification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
