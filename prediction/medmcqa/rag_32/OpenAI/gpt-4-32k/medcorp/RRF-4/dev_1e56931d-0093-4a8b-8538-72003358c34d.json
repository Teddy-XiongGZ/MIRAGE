    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of raised aerial pCO2 in a motorcyclist after a road traffic accident. pCO2, or partial pressure of carbon dioxide, is a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. It is usually measured as part of an arterial blood gas (ABG) test. A high pCO2 level can indicate a problem with the body's ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is primarily a function of the respiratory system. Therefore, the cause of the raised pCO2 could be due to damage to the respiratory apparatus (lungs, airways), damage to the respiratory centre in the brain which controls breathing, or both. However, the documents provided do not give specific information about the effects of road traffic accidents on motorcyclists' respiratory system or respiratory centre. Therefore, I cannot definitively choose an answer based on the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"N/A\"}"
