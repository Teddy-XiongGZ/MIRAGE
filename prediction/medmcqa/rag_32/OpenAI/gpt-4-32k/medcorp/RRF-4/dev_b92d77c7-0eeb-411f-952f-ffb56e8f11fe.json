    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a drop in fetal heart rate that is typically less than 2 minutes and usually associated with umbilical cord compression. From Document [0], we learn that variable decelerations are generally a result of umbilical cord compression and they are defined as abrupt decreases in fetal heart rate, lasting at least 15 seconds but less than 2 minutes in duration. This matches the description given in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Variable deceleration\"}"
