From the documents, it is clear that the first step in treating a patient with dental caries is history taking, followed by oral care assessment and caries risk assessment. These steps are crucial in understanding the patient's oral health status and risk factors for caries. The next step is diet counseling, as diet plays a significant role in the development and progression of dental caries. After these steps, the actual treatment of the caries begins.
