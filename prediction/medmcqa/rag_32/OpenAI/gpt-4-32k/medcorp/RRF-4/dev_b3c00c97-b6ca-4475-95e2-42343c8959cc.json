Document [14] talks about a mass vaccination campaign using oral cholera vaccines. Therefore, both measles and cholera are mentioned as diseases that can be prevented with vaccination in a post-disaster situation.

Therefore, the answer should be measles and cholera, but not typhoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All\"}"
