    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the source of collagen's strength. From the documents, it is clear that the strength of collagen is due to its unique structure, particularly its triple helical structure and the arrangement of collagen fibers. However, none of the options provided directly relate to this. Looking closer at the options, they are all amino acids. Collagen is a protein and is made up of amino acids. Among the options, hydroxyproline is a key component of the collagen triple helix. Hydroxyproline contributes to the stability of the collagen triple helix, and thus, it can be inferred that it contributes to the strength of collagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
