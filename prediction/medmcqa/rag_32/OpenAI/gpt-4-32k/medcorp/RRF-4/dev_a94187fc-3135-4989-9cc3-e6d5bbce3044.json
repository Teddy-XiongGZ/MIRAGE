    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that clinical examination is a crucial part of the follow-up process for a child with a mandibular fracture. However, radiographic examination is also important for evaluating bone healing. Document [0] suggests that radiographic examination is recommended during the fifth week after a mandibular fracture in patients less than 18 years of age. Document [1] mentions that follow-up computed tomography examination data were available for 20 cases, and revealed different degrees of radiolucency indicating that osteolysis had occurred. However, it does not specify the frequency of these examinations. Document [24] mentions that radiographs were done at 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months postoperatively to observe any displacement and fracture healing. Based on these documents, it seems that a combination of clinical examination and radiographic examination would be the best approach for checking bone healing in a 5-year-old child with a mandibular fracture on a follow-up recall after 2 months.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. OPG at every 2 month till one year\"}"
