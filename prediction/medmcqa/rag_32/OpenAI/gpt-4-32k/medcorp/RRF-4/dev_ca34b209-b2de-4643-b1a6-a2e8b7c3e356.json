    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best method to observe an occluded submandibular salivary duct. Palpation is a physical examination method and may not provide a detailed view of the duct. Thermography is a method that uses temperature differences to create an image, but it may not be specific enough for observing a small structure like a salivary duct. An occlusal X-ray provides a view of the upper and lower teeth and may not provide a detailed view of the salivary duct. Sialography, on the other hand, is a specific imaging technique used to visualize the salivary glands and ducts. It involves the injection of a contrast dye into the salivary ducts, followed by X-ray imaging. This method would provide a detailed view of the duct and would be able to show if it is occluded. Therefore, sialography seems to be the best method to observe an occluded submandibular salivary duct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
