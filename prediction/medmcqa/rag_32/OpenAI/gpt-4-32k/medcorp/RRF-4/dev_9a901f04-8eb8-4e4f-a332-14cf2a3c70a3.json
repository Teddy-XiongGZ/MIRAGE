    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Clavulanic acid is a \u03b2-lactam drug that functions as a mechanism-based \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. It is not effective by itself as an antibiotic, but when combined with penicillin-group antibiotics, it can overcome antibiotic resistance in bacteria that secrete \u03b2-lactamase, which otherwise inactivates most penicillins. This is stated in Document [5]. Therefore, the addition of clavulanic acid to ampicillin would inhibit \u03b2-lactamases, making option B the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
