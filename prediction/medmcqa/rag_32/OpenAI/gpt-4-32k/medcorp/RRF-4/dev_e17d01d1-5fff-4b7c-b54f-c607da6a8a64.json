    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the age at which the growth of the nasal bone is completed. Document [20] states that 98% of white adolescent girls are nasally mature at the age of 15.8 years and 98% of white adolescent boys are nasally mature at the age of 16.9 years. This suggests that the growth of the nasal bone is completed around these ages. However, none of the provided answer choices match these ages. Therefore, I need to look for more information. Document [14] states that nasal height and nasal bridge length become fully mature in males at 15 years and fully mature in females at 12 years. This is closer to the provided answer choices, but still does not match any of them exactly. Therefore, I need to choose the closest available option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
