    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the proportions of calcium (Ca), phosphorous (PO4), and potassium (K) in early plaque in heavy calculus formers. Looking at the documents, Document [0] mentions the mean values of Ca, P, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, and K in enamel samples from heavy- and non-calculus-formers, but it does not provide specific proportions. Document [1] discusses the concentrations of various elements in soft plaque and calcified plaque deposits, but it does not specifically address the proportions of Ca, PO4, and K in early plaque in heavy calculus formers. Document [3] discusses the composition of dental calculus, stating that it is composed primarily of calcium phosphate mineral salts, but it does not mention potassium. Document [10] mentions that calculus is composed of calcium phosphate crystals, but it does not provide specific proportions or mention potassium. Document [13] discusses the composition of sub-gingival calculus, but it does not provide specific proportions or mention potassium. Document [21] discusses the formation of calcium phosphates in saliva and dental plaque, but it does not provide specific proportions or mention potassium. Document [30] discusses the effect of daily intake of Ascophyllum nodosum alga on calculus, plaque formation, and gingival health, but it does not provide specific proportions or mention potassium. None of the documents provide specific proportions of Ca, PO4, and K in early plaque in heavy calculus formers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
