    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that UV light can damage the DNA of living organisms by creating nucleic acid dimers. This is particularly effective for viruses as their particles are small and the UV rays can reach the genetic material, inducing the dimerisation of nucleic acids. Once the DNA is dimerised, the virus particles cannot replicate their genetic material which prevents them from spreading. Therefore, it is the nucleic acids that sensitize bacteria and viruses to UV irradiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Nucleic acids\"}"
