    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Granulation tissue is a part of the normal healing process after a surgical procedure, including periodontal surgery. It is a type of tissue that forms on the surfaces of wounds during the healing process, which is rich in blood vessels and has a rough or granular appearance. Therefore, seeing granulation tissue a week after surgery could be a normal finding. However, if the granulation tissue is excessive or appears as a large, round, elevated mass, it could be due to other factors. Incomplete calculus removal could potentially lead to continued inflammation and excessive granulation tissue formation. Mechanical irritation due to the periodontal pack could also cause excessive granulation tissue. An allergy to components in the pack is less likely, as this would more commonly result in symptoms such as itching, redness, or swelling, rather than granulation tissue formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Normal finding\"}"
