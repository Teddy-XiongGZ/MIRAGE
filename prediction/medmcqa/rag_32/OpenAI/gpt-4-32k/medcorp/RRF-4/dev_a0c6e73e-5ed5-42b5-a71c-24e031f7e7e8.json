    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Soft tissue curettage is a procedure that involves the removal of tissue. According to Document [2], gingival curettage was designed to promote new connective tissue attachment to the tooth by the removal of pocket lining and junctional epithelium. However, it is not recommended for the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Therefore, it is not likely to be used for deep pockets with gingivitis or infrabony pockets. Document [12] also mentions that soft tissue curettage results in the formation of a long junctional epithelium rather than new connective tissue attachment. This suggests that it might be used for shallow pockets with gingivitis. There is no mention of its use for oedematous gingiva.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
