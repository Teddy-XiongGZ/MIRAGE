    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each type of traction is used for. From Document [4], I can see that Bryant's traction is used for fractures of the femur or congenital abnormalities of the hip, so it is used in the lower limb. Document [15] mentions that Dunlop's traction is used for humeral fractures in children, which means it is used for the upper limb, not the lower limb. I couldn't find specific information about Gallows and Perkin traction in the documents, so I will need to make an educated guess based on the information I have.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Dunlop\"}"
