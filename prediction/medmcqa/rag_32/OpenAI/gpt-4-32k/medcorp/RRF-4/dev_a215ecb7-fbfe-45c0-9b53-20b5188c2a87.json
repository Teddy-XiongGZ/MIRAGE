    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide a clear comparison between the physical characteristics of reamers and files. However, from the information provided, it can be inferred that the number of flutes on the blade might be a distinguishing factor. Document [23] mentions that the debris transportation characteristics of reamers and files are similar, which suggests that the number of flutes might be similar as well. However, this is not explicitly stated. Document [9] also mentions that flute number had no effect on cutting efficiency, but it does not specify whether this applies to both reamers and files. Therefore, the answer is not clear from the documents provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
