    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it's asking. The question is asking which of the given options show a chemical bond with enamel. Step 2: Review the documents for information about the options and their bonding with enamel. Step 3: Document [3] mentions that MDP (10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate), which is a component of BIS-GMA resins, has been proven to possess chemical bonding ability to tooth hard tissues, including enamel. Step 4: Document [19] mentions that chemical bonding may be present for some self-etch adhesive systems, which could include composites and direct filling resins. However, it does not provide enough increase in bond strength to compete with the bond produced by etch-and-rinse systems using phosphoric acid etching of enamel. Step 5: Document [30] mentions that enamel bond strengths of the polyacid-modified composites, which could include polycarboxylate cements, were greater compared with the materials applied after surface conditioning with polyacrylic acid-containing agents. Step 6: Based on the information from the documents, it can be concluded that BIS-GMA resins in pit and fissure sealants (D) show a chemical bond with enamel. The other options may also bond with enamel, but the documents do not provide clear evidence of a chemical bond. The answer is D. BIS-GMA resins in pit and fissure sealants.
