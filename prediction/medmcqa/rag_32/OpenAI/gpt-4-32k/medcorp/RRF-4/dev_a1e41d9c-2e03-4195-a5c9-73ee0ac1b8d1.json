    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tooth development is a complex process that involves interactions between different types of cells. According to Document [1], the process of tooth development results from interactions between the ectoderm of the oral cavity, which gives rise to cells that produce enamel, and the neural crest ectomesenchyme which gives rise to the tooth structures other than enamel. Therefore, tooth development involves both ectoderm and ectomesenchyme, which is a type of mesoderm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Ectoderm, mesoderm\"}"
