    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lag phase of tooth movement is a period during which little to no tooth movement occurs due to hyalinization and undermining resorption. This phase is part of the tooth movement cycle, which includes an initial phase, a lag phase, and a post-lag phase. According to Document [2], the lag phase typically lasts for approximately 21 days before tooth movement occurs. This is also supported by Document [15], which states that the lag phase was eliminated and average velocities were 0.87 and 1.27 mm/month for 18 and 60 g of average retraction force. Therefore, the lag phase of tooth movement usually lasts for about 2-3 weeks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
