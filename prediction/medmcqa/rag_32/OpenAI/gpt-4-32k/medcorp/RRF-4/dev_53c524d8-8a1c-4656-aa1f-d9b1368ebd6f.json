    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a statistical test to compare the rates of extubation failure between two groups: those using conventional CPAP and those using bubble CPAP. The data is categorical (success or failure of extubation) and we are comparing two independent groups. Therefore, the appropriate statistical test would be the Chi square test, which is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables in independent groups.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
