    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the outcome of a lateral sliding flap procedure done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years. The lateral sliding flap is a surgical procedure used to treat gingival recession by moving a section of gum tissue from an adjacent tooth to cover the exposed root. From the documents, it is clear that this procedure can result in soft tissue coverage over the denuded root and a gain in the width of keratinized gingiva. However, the documents do not provide specific information about the attachment of periodontal ligament (PDL) fibers to cementum or dentin, or about the co-adaptation to the remaining fibers. The documents do mention the formation of new attachment, which could include PDL fibers, but this is not specified. The most relevant information provided in the documents is that the procedure results in the coverage of the previously denuded root surfaces, which suggests that the epithelium would be adjacent to these surfaces after the procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Epithelium adjacent to previously denuded root surface\"}"
