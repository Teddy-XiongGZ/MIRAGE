    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red blood cells, which can cause their destruction. This is often seen in conditions such as hemolytic anemia due to transfusion and drug-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), as mentioned in documents [1], [2], and [24]. However, aplastic anemia is a condition where the body stops producing enough new blood cells, not a condition where the body destroys its own red blood cells. Therefore, a direct Coombs test would not be positive in aplastic anemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
