    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The free gingival graft is a procedure where a small layer of tissue is removed from the palate of the patient's mouth and then relocated to the site of gum recession. According to Document [5], the surface epithelium of free gingival grafts degenerates and re-epithelizes by cells proliferating from adjacent tissues.

Instead, it degenerates and then regenerates or proliferates from the cells of the surrounding tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Degenerates\"}"
