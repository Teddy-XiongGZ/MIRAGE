    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same. Therefore, the question is essentially asking for the proportion of the population that falls between the mean and one standard deviation above the mean. According to the empirical rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule for a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. However, this is for both below and above the mean. Since the question is asking for the proportion between the mean (which is also the median in this case) and one standard deviation above, we need to take half of this value. Therefore, the answer is 0.68 / 2 = 0.34.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
