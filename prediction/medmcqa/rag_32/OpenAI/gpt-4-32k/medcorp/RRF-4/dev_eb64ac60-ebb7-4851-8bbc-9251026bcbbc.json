    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process that is regulated by dedicated genes, so option D is true. During apoptosis, the plasma membrane remains intact to prevent the leakage of intracellular contents that could trigger inflammation, so options A and B are also true. However, during apoptosis, the cell shrinks and the organelles remain intact, which contradicts option C that suggests organelle swelling. Therefore, option C is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
