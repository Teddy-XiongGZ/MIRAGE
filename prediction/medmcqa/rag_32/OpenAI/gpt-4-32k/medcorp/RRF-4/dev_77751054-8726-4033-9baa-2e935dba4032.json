    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endogenous staining of teeth occurs during tooth development and is intrinsic, meaning it cannot be removed through mechanical measures. From the documents, it is clear that tetracycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, can cause yellow-green discoloration of teeth during development, so option A is not the answer. Neonatal liver disease can also cause tooth discoloration due to bilirubin deposition in the teeth, so option C is not the answer. However, there is no mention in the documents of Rh incompatibility or Vitamin-C deficiency causing endogenous staining of teeth. Rh incompatibility can cause neonatal jaundice, which might lead to teeth discoloration, but it is not directly responsible for the staining. On the other hand, Vitamin-C deficiency is known to cause scurvy and gum disease, but not intrinsic staining of teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Vitamin-C deficiency\"}"
