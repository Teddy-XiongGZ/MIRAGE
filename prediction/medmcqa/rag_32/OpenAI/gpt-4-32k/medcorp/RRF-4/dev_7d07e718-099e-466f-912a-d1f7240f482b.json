    "First, let's go through each option one by one: A. Thoracic esophagus drains into the azygos vein: This is mentioned in Document [0], which states that the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos vein. B. Esophageal veins drain into a submucosal plexus: This is mentioned in Document [2], which states that the esophageal veins originate from a submucosal venous plexus. C. The cervical esophagus drains directly into the right brachiocephalic vein: I couldn't find any document that mentions the cervical esophagus draining directly into the right brachiocephalic vein. Document [0] mentions that the upper parts of the esophagus drain into the inferior thyroid artery, but it doesn't mention the right brachiocephalic vein. D. Lower esophageal veins anastomose with the left gastric vein: This is mentioned in Document [0], which states that blood from the lower part of the esophagus drains into the left gastric vein. Based on the information from the documents, the statement that the cervical esophagus drains directly into the right brachiocephalic vein seems to be incorrect. So, the answer is C. The cervical esophagus drains directly into the right brachiocephalic vein.
