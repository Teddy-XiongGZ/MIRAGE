    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Modified Shock Index (MSI) is a variation of the Shock Index (SI). The SI is calculated as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure (HR/SBP). The MSI, on the other hand, uses the mean arterial pressure (MAP) instead of the systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the MSI is represented as the ratio of heart rate to mean arterial pressure (HR/MAP).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
