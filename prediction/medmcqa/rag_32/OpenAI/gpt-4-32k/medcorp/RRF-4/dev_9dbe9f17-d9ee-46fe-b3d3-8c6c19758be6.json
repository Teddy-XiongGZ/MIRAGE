    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a statistical test to compare the outcomes of postpartum depression in mothers who gave birth to male children versus those who gave birth to female children. This is a comparison between two independent groups (mothers of male children and mothers of female children), and the outcome is categorical (presence or absence of postpartum depression). Therefore, the appropriate statistical test would be the Chi-square test, which is used to compare categorical variables in two or more independent groups.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Chi-square test\"}"
