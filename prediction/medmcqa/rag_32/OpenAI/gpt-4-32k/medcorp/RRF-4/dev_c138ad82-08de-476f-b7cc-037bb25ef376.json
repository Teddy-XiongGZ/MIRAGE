    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most constant and valuable trait to differentiate among maxillary 1st, 2nd, and 3rd molars. Looking at the documents, Document [3] mentions that the maxillary first molars have a distinct mesiolingual cusp, which is the largest and sharpest. Document [2] and Document [12] mention that maxillary second molars have four cusps, two buccal and two palatal. Document [5] provides information about the third molar, mentioning its morphometric features, but does not provide specific information about the ML cusp size or the position of DL or ML grooves. Therefore, the ML cusp size seems to be a distinguishing feature of the maxillary first molar, which is not mentioned for the second and third molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. ML cusp size\"}"
