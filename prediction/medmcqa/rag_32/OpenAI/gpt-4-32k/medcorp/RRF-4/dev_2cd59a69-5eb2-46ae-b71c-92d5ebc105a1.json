    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the shape formed by joining the orifices of the MB1, Distal, and Palatal canals in the maxillary 1st molar. Since there are three points (MB1, Distal, and Palatal), when connected, they would form a triangle. The question does not specify if it's a maxillary triangle or a molar triangle. However, since we are talking about molars, it would be more appropriate to refer to it as a molar triangle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Molar Triangle\"}"
