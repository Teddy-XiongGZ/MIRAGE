    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CpG islands are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide. These regions can be methylated to form 5-methylcytosines, as stated in Document [2]. Alkylation is a process that introduces an alkyl group into a molecule, but it is not specifically mentioned in the context of CpG islands in the provided documents. Phosphorylation is a process that involves the addition of a phosphate group to a molecule, but it is not mentioned in the context of CpG islands in the documents. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification involving the attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to other proteins, but it is not mentioned in the context of CpG islands in the documents. Therefore, the processes that do not occur at cytosine residues at CpG islands in DNA are alkylation, phosphorylation, and sumoylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Alkylation, C. Phosphorylation, D. Sumoylation\"}"
