    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each surgical procedure entails. A labyrinthectomy involves removing the inner ear structures responsible for balance, which can relieve vertigo but also results in complete hearing loss in the affected ear. A vestibular neurectomy involves cutting the vestibular nerve, which can relieve vertigo while preserving hearing. Endolymphatic sac decompression involves relieving pressure in the inner ear, which can help control vertigo and potentially improve hearing. Cochleosacculotomy involves making an incision in the cochlea and saccule, which can relieve vertigo but may also result in hearing loss. Looking at the documents, Document [10] indicates that vestibular neurectomy has a high success rate in relieving vertigo while preserving hearing. Document [15] suggests that endolymphatic sac decompression surgery can control vertigo and stabilize hearing for the majority of patients. Document [30] suggests that endolymphatic sac surgery offers relief from vertigo in selected patients, but patients need to be cautioned about the risk of hearing loss. Based on these documents, it seems that vestibular neurectomy and endolymphatic sac decompression are the most effective surgeries for relieving intractable vertigo in Meniere's disease patients while also preserving hearing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Vestibular neurectomy\"}"
