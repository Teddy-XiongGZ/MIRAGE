    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Flow cytometry is a technique used to detect and measure physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells or particles. The forward scatter in flow cytometry is related to the size of the cell. This is mentioned in Document [0] where it states that there is a relationship between forward scattered light and cell volume. This is also supported by Document [1] which discusses the basic principles of the scattering of light from small particles such as cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cell size\"}"
