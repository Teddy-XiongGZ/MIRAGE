    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anteroposterior relationship of the jaws is a measure of the relative positions of the upper and lower jaws in the sagittal plane. Document [1] mentions that the APDI and Wits appraisal are parameters for evaluating the anteroposterior relationship of the dentition rather than the jaws. The ANB angle, mentioned in option A, is a commonly used cephalometric measurement to assess the anteroposterior relationship of the maxilla and mandible. The other options (B, C, D) refer to angles involving the SN (Sella-Nasion) line and various planes, but these are typically used to assess cranial base orientation or jaw inclination, not the anteroposterior jaw relationship.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
