    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child presents with left ventricular hypertrophy and central cyanosis. Tricuspid atresia usually presents with cyanosis in the first week of life, which is not the case here. Eisenmenger syndrome is a complication of a left-to-right shunt, such as a ventricular septal defect, which over time leads to pulmonary hypertension and reversal of the shunt to a right-to-left shunt, causing cyanosis. However, it does not typically cause left ventricular hypertrophy. Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage would cause cyanosis, but not left ventricular hypertrophy. Tetralogy of Fallot, on the other hand, is a condition that can present with cyanosis and includes right ventricular hypertrophy as one of its components. However, it does not typically cause left ventricular hypertrophy. None of the options perfectly match the presentation, but Eisenmenger syndrome seems to be the closest match, as it can cause cyanosis and may lead to left ventricular hypertrophy due to increased pressure load on the left ventricle over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
