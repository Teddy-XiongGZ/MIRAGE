    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Simple random sampling is a method where each individual in a population has an equal chance of being selected. This method is best used when the population is relatively homogeneous, as stated in Document 19.

Therefore, it is not ideal for a heterogeneous population or for all of the above, which includes heterogeneous population.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Homogenous population\"}"
