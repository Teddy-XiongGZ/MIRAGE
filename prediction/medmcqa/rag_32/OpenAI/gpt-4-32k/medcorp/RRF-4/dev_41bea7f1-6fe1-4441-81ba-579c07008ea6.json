    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where a patient develops hypotension shortly after the administration of epidural anesthesia. Hypotension is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia, often due to the systemic absorption of the drug, which can cause vasodilation and subsequently lower blood pressure. However, the timing of the hypotension in this case is quite rapid, occurring just 3 minutes after administration. This rapid onset of hypotension suggests that the anesthesia may have been administered into the subarachnoid space, rather than the epidural space. When local anesthetics intended for the epidural space are accidentally administered into the subarachnoid space, they can cause a more profound and rapid onset of anesthesia, leading to significant hypotension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Penetration into the subarachnoid space\"}"
