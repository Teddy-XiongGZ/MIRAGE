    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the optimal time to employ an orthodontic appliance that takes advantage of growth is during a period of active growth. Document [3] suggests that the best time to prescribe one of these appliances is in alignment with the pubertal growth spurt. Document [18] also mentions that such growth-related problems are most amenable to correction during the active growing period. Document [31] also mentions that the treatment with Fixed Functional Appliances (FFAs) helps in resolution of the problem without sacrificing the dentition during the deceleration phase of growth. Therefore, the best time to employ an orthodontic appliance that takes advantage of growth is during the late mixed dentition stage, which is when the pubertal growth spurt typically occurs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
