    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The metabolism of Vitamin D involves two hydroxylation steps. The first step is 25-alpha hydroxylation which occurs in the liver, as stated in Document 0. The second step is 1-alpha hydroxylation which occurs in the kidney, also mentioned in Document 0. Therefore, options A and B are correct. Document 4 suggests that to achieve a blood level above 30 ng/mL, which is considered healthy, requires the ingestion of 3000 IU of vitamin D a day. This suggests that the daily requirement in the absence of sunlight is likely higher than 450-600 IU/day, making option C incorrect. However, the question asks for the statement that is not true. Therefore, I need to verify option D. Williams syndrome is not mentioned in any of the provided documents, so I cannot confirm or deny its association with obesity, mental retardation, and precocious puberty based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
