    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about a process that can change gene expression through methylation and acetylation without altering the gene's content. Translocation, inversion, and transduction are all genetic mechanisms that involve changes to the DNA sequence itself, which contradicts the question's premise. On the other hand, epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Methylation and acetylation are examples of such epigenetic modifications, as mentioned in Document [1]. Therefore, the correct answer is epigenetics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
