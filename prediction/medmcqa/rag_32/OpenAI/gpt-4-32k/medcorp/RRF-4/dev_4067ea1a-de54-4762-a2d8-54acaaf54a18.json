    "First, I will review the documents to find information related to each of the answer choices. A. Hepatitis B core antigen status is the most sensitive indicator of positive vertical transmission of disease - Document [29] mentions that testing for total hepatitis B core antibody, an indicator of past or current HBV infection, was useful for resolving discrepancies in test results. However, it does not specifically state that it is the most sensitive indicator of positive vertical transmission of disease. B. Hepatitis B is the most common form of hepatitis after blood transfusion - I could not find any specific information in the documents that supports this statement. C. The proper treatment of infants born to infected mothers includes the administration of hepatitis B immune globulin as well as vaccine - Document [0] mentions that children born from hepatitis B virus carriers should receive a postpartal passive-active immunization. Document [4] also mentions that for acute hepatitis B, with appropriate immunoprophylaxis, including hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine, breastfeeding of infants of HBV infected mother's poses no additional risk for the transmission of the hepatitis B virus. D. Patients who develop chronic active hepatitis should undergo MTP - I could not find any specific information in the documents that supports this statement. Based on the information found in the documents, the most accurate statement appears to be C. The proper treatment of infants born to infected mothers includes the administration of hepatitis B immune globulin as well as vaccine. So, the final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed the documents and found that statement C is supported by information in Document [0] and Document [4], which mention that children born from hepatitis B virus carriers should receive a postpartal passive-active immunization, including hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine. I could not find specific information that supports the other statements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
