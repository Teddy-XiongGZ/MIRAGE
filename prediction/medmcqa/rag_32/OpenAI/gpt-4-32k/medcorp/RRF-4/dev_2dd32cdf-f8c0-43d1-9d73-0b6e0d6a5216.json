    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lingually placed mandibular posteriors refer to the positioning of the back teeth (molars and premolars) on the lower jaw towards the tongue side. This positioning can potentially cause several issues. Gagging can occur due to the proximity of the teeth to the sensitive areas of the tongue and throat. Speech difficulties can arise as the tongue's movement can be restricted or altered by the lingually placed teeth. Excessive pressure on the ridge can occur as the force of biting and chewing is directed towards the inner side of the jaw. However, tongue interference is not a likely issue. The tongue is highly adaptable and can adjust its movements to accommodate changes in the oral cavity, including the lingual placement of mandibular posteriors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tongue interference\"}"
