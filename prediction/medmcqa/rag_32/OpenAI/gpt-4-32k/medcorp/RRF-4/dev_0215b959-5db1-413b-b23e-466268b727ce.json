    "First, I will review the documents to find information about the cusps of the mandibular primary second molar. Document [1] states that there are usually four cusps on mandibular second molars: two buccal and two lingual. However, it does not provide information about the size of these cusps. Document [23] also mentions the presence of four cusps but does not provide information about their sizes. None of the other documents seem to provide specific information about the size of the cusps on the mandibular primary second molar. Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot definitively answer the question. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed the documents to find information about the cusps of the mandibular primary second molar.
