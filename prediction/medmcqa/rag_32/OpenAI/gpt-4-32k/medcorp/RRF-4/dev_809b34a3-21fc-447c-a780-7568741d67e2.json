    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the definition of 'flow of a material'. From the documents, it is clear that the flow of a material refers to the movement or transfer of the material from one place to another, often in the context of supply chain management or industrial processes. None of the options provided exactly match this definition. However, option A, 'Continued change of the material under a given load', could potentially be interpreted as referring to the movement or transfer of a material under certain conditions, although it's not a perfect match. Options B, C, and D do not seem to relate to the concept of material flow as described in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
