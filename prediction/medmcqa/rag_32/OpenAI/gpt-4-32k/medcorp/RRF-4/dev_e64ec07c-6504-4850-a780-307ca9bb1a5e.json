    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Elastin is a protein that provides elasticity to tissues such as blood vessels, lungs, and skin. Abnormalities in elastin can lead to various diseases. For example, Marfan syndrome, which is associated with abnormalities in elastin, can lead to aortic aneurysm and subluxation of the lens, as mentioned in Document [0] and Document [25]. Joint laxity can also be a result of elastin abnormalities, as seen in conditions like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is not mentioned in the documents but is a known medical fact. However, there is no mention in the documents of fractures being a result of elastin abnormalities. Fractures are typically associated with abnormalities in collagen, not elastin, as seen in Document [20].\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
