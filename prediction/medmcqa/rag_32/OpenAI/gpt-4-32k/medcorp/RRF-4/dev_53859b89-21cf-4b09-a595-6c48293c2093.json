    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for a true statement about octreotide. Step 2: Review the answer choices. A. Stimulates growth hormone secretion - This seems unlikely as octreotide is often used in conditions where there is an excess of growth hormone. B. Used in secretory diarrhea - This could be possible as octreotide has a wide range of uses. C. Orally active - This seems unlikely as most medications of this type are not orally active. D. Contraindicated in acromegaly - This seems unlikely as octreotide is often used in the treatment of acromegaly. Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [13] states that octreotide is used for the treatment of growth hormone producing tumors (acromegaly and gigantism), when surgery is contraindicated, pituitary tumors that secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropinoma), diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with carcinoid syndrome, and diarrhea in people with vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors (VIPomas). This supports answer choice B and contradicts answer choices A and D. Document [24] states that there are no oral formulations available for octreotide, contradicting answer choice C. Step 4: Choose the correct answer based on the information from the documents. The correct answer is B. Used in secretory diarrhea. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a true statement about octreotide. After reviewing the answer choices and relevant documents, it is clear that octreotide is used in secretory diarrhea. The other answer choices are contradicted by the information in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
