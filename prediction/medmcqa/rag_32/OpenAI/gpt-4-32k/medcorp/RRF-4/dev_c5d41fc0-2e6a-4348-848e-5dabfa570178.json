    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fluid deficit during a hysteroscopic myomectomy is a common occurrence and is usually due to the absorption of the irrigation fluid into the bloodstream. A deficit of 500ml is not uncommon and does not necessarily indicate a problem. However, it is important to monitor the patient's fluid status carefully throughout the procedure to ensure that fluid overload does not occur. Fluid overload can lead to water intoxication, which can be a serious complication. Therefore, the surgery should continue with careful monitoring of the patient's fluid status. Changing the fluid to normal saline or giving furosemide are not necessary at this point. Stopping the surgery is also not necessary unless the patient shows signs of fluid overload or other complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
