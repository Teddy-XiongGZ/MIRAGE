From the documents, it is clear that E. multilocularis is a parasite that causes alveolar echinococcosis, a disease that behaves like a slow-growing liver tumor. E. granulosus, on the other hand, causes cystic echinococcosis, but the documents do not mention it behaving like a slow-growing liver tumor.
