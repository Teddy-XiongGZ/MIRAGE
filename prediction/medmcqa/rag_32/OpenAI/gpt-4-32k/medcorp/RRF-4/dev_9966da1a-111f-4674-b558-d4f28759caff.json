    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The APGAR score ranges from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best possible condition for a newborn. If most of the readings are 7 or above, it means that the majority of the data points are concentrated towards the higher end of the scale. This would cause the distribution to be skewed towards the left, as the tail of the distribution would extend towards the lower scores. Therefore, the data distribution is negatively skewed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Negatively skewed data\"}"
