    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Looking at the documents, Document [0] mentions a post-disaster vaccination campaign for children in Haiti, but it doesn't specify the type of vaccine used. Document [3] discusses the use of cholera vaccines in post-disaster situations, specifically mentioning a mass vaccination campaign in Aceh province, Indonesia, after the 2004 tsunami. Document [12] talks about a mass vaccination against measles conducted in Aila cyclone-affected blocks of West Bengal, India. Document [13] also mentions a vaccination campaign against measles, rubella and poliomyelitis among Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals in Bangladesh. Document [23] mentions a successful mass vaccination campaign against chickenpox in a temporary camp for earthquake victims in Spain. Document [28] mentions that diseases such as cholera and measles, which spread rapidly in large populations living in close proximity, such as in a refugee camp, can be prevented with vaccination. Therefore, based on the documents, both cholera and measles vaccines have been used effectively in mass vaccination campaigns post-disaster. However, there is no mention of typhoid or scrub typhus vaccines being used in such situations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cholera, C. Measles\"}"
