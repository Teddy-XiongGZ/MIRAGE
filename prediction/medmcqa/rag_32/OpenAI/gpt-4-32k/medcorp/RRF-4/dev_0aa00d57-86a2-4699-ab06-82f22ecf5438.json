    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tool that is helpful in making radicular access after entry. From the documents, Document [2] describes a technique for retrieving instrument fragments from curved and narrow canals, which involves creating an access to instrument fragments in the middle and apical thirds of the root canal. However, it does not specify which tool is used for this process. None of the other documents provide information about the specific tools used for radicular access after entry. Therefore, I will have to rely on my medical knowledge to answer this question. A Gates Glidden drill is used to enlarge the coronal portion of the canal and not typically used for radicular access. A K-File is a type of endodontic file used to clean and shape the root canal, making it a likely choice for radicular access. A K-Reamer is also an endodontic tool used for cleaning and shaping the root canal, but it is less flexible than a K-File and therefore less likely to be used for radicular access. A round bur is typically used for decay removal and cavity preparation, not for radicular access. Therefore, the K-File is the most likely choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
