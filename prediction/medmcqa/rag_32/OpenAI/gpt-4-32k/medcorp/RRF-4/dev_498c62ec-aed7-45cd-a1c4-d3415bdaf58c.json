    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that the addition of metal particles to glass ionomer cement improves its mechanical properties, including strength and resistance to abrasion. Document [0] states that the addition of silver or amalgam alloy powders to the glass ionomer cement improves its tensile strength, hardness, and bonding strength. Document [5] also supports this, stating that the addition of metal to glass-ionomer cements can markedly increase the strength of the materials. Document [24] mentions that the addition of metal particles as in the admixed-type metal-reinforced glass ionomer produced a material with increased fatigue resistance. However, there is no mention of the color or ease of manipulation being affected by the addition of metal particles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increased resistance to abrasion\"}"
