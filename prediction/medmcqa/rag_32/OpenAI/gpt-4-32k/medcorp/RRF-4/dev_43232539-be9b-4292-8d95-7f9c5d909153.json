    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention two types of lasers used in TMJ arthroscopy: the 308-nm excimer laser and the holmium:YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser. The excimer laser is mentioned in Document [1] and is described as an ideal tool for TMJ arthroscopic surgery. However, the question specifically asks about the laser used for adhesion lysis. Document [2] mentions the holmium:YAG laser and its use in TMJ arthroscopy, stating that it can precisely and rapidly resect cartilaginous tissues with only moderate necrosis, can function in a saline environment, and can be transmitted through conventional optical fibers. Therefore, the holmium:YAG laser is the one used for adhesion lysis in TMJ arthroscopy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
