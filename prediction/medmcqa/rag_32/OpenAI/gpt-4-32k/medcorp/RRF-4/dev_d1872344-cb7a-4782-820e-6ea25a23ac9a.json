    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the time period during which the maximum strain on a pregnant woman's heart occurs. Document [20] discusses how the heart's function changes during pregnancy, but it does not specify when the maximum strain occurs. Document [12] mentions that pregnancy is associated with increased cardiac performance and progressive left ventricular remodeling, but it does not specify when the maximum strain occurs. Document [24] discusses changes in myocardial deformation in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy, but it does not specify when the maximum strain occurs. Document [18] discusses changes in left ventricular myocardial contractile function during pregnancy, but it does not specify when the maximum strain occurs. Document [4] discusses the effects of the hemodynamic load of pregnancy on the contractile state of the left ventricle, and it mentions that the contractile state transiently decreases during gestation, returning to non-pregnant values 2 to 4 weeks postpartum. This suggests that the maximum strain on the heart may occur during pregnancy, rather than immediately postpartum. However, none of the documents provide a clear answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
