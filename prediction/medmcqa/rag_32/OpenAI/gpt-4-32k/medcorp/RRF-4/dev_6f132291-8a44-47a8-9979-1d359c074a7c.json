    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The superior laryngeal nerve divides into two branches: the internal and external laryngeal nerves. The internal laryngeal nerve supplies the mucosa of the larynx down to the level of the vocal folds, as stated in Document [0] and Document [6]. The external laryngeal nerve, on the other hand, supplies the cricothyroid muscle, as mentioned in Document [7] and Document [26]. Therefore, the nerve supply of the mucosa of the larynx, from the epiglottis to the level of the cords, is provided by the internal laryngeal nerve, not the external laryngeal or recurrent laryngeal nerves.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
