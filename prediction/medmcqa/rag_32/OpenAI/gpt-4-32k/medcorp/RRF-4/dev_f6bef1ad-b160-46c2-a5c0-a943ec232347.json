    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of recurrent bloody diarrhea could be indicative of several conditions, including Crohn's disease, adenocarcinoma colon, pseudomembranous colitis, and ulcerative colitis. However, the presence of multiple geographic ulcers on colonoscopy is more suggestive of inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Adenocarcinoma of the colon typically presents as a mass or polyp, and pseudomembranous colitis usually presents with pseudomembranes on colonoscopy. Between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the latter is more likely to present with bloody diarrhea. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by skip lesions, while ulcerative colitis typically starts in the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous manner. The histopathological image is not provided in the question, but if it showed chronic inflammation confined to the mucosa, it would be more indicative of ulcerative colitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Ulcerative colitis\"}"
