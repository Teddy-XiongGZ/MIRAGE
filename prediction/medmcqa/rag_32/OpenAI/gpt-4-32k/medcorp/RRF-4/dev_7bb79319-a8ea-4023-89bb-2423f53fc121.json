    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parotid gland is located in the preauricular region and is closely related to the facial nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve. Document [0] mentions that after surgical removal of the parotid gland, the auriculotemporal nerve is liable to damage. Document [1] also mentions that the excision of the parotid gland can result in facial nerve damage. The lesser occipital nerve, hypoglossal nerve, and chorda tympani are not directly related to the parotid gland. The submandibular duct is related to the submandibular gland, not the parotid gland. The cervical fascia is not a nerve and thus would not be 'damaged' in the same sense as a nerve would be during surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
