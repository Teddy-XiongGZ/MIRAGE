    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The square knot is mentioned in several documents. According to Document [0], the square knot is a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection. This means that the two parts of the knot are mirror images of each other. Document [1] also refers to the square knot as a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection. This suggests that the two parts of the knot are not identical, but mirror images, which means they are thrown in opposite directions. The question does not specify whether the loops are single or double, but since a trefoil knot is a simple knot with a single loop, it is reasonable to assume that the loops in a square knot are also single.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
