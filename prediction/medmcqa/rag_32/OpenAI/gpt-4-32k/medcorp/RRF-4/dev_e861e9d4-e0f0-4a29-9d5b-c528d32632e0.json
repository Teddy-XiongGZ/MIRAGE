    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the concentration of triple antibiotic paste (TAP) used in revascularization treatment. Document [0] mentions that the study used 1000 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL of TAP. Document [10] mentions that 0.125 mg/ml of TAP showed a significant antibacterial effect with no cytotoxic effects on dental pulp stem cells. Document [29] mentions that TAP at 10 mg/mL was able to completely eliminate bacteria inside dentinal tubules. Document [30] mentions a low-concentration TAP prototype with a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Considering all these documents, the concentration of TAP used in treatment can vary, but the options provided in the question are 1 mg, 0.1 mg, 100 mg, and 10 mg. Based on the documents, 1 mg and 10 mg are mentioned as concentrations used in studies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 1 mg, D. 10 mg\"}"
