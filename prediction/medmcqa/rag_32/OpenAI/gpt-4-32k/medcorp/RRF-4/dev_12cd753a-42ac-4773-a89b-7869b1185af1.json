    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates involuntary physiological processes. The ANS is controlled by pathways that synapse on autonomic preganglionic neurons. These pathways include spinal cord and brainstem reflex pathways, as well as descending control systems originating at higher levels of the nervous system, such as the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus serves as the integrating mechanism of the autonomic nervous system and limbic system. Therefore, the center of activity of the autonomic nervous system is the hypothalamus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hypothalamus\"}"
