    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid axonal flow, also known as fast axonal transport, is the process by which materials are moved along the axon of a neuron. Document [13] mentions that traditional fast motors, such as conventional kinesin and dynein, are responsible for these fast motions. Document [23] also mentions that microtubules are not required for fast anterograde axoplasmic transport. Neurofilaments, according to Document [21], are transported in a slow axonal transport process, which is different from the rapid axonal flow. Therefore, neurofilaments are not involved in rapid axonal flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Neurofilaments\"}"
