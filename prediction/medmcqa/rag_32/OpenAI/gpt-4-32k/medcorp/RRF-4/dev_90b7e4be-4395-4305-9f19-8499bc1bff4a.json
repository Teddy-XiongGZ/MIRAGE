    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in the lymph node biopsy is indicative of Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the specific subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma can be determined by the immunohistochemical profile of the cells. In this case, the cells are positive for CD20, LCA, and EMA, but negative for CD15, CD30, and EBV. This immunophenotype is consistent with Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLPHL), which is characterized by the presence of LP (lymphocyte-predominant) cells that are CD20 positive and CD15 and CD30 negative, as seen in Document [3].\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma\"}"
