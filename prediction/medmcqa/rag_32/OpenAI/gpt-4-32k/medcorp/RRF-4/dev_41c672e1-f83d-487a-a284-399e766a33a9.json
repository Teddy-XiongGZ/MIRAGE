    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inter-radicular area refers to the space between the roots of a tooth. According to Document [0], the inter-radicular area is part of the molar teeth root furcations, which are involved in periodontal disease. Document [2] also mentions the inter-radicular space in the context of miniscrew placement in the posterior region of the mandible. However, neither of these documents specify the type of bone present in the inter-radicular area. Document [15] mentions that root resorption occurs in the inter-radicular area, but it does not specify the type of bone. Document [19] discusses the inter-radicular width in the context of immediate molar implant placement, but it does not specify the type of bone. However, Document [10] mentions that cancellous bone flanked by lamina dura was found between 89.6% of the teeth examined and was observed where inter-root distances exceeded 0.5 mm. This suggests that the inter-radicular area is primarily composed of cancellous bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
