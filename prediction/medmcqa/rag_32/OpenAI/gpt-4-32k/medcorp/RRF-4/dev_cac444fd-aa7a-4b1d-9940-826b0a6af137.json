    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chronic gingival inflammation is a response to bacterial plaque accumulation. This response involves various immune cells. Neutrophils are the first line of defense and they phagocytose the bacteria. When there is too much plaque for the neutrophils to handle, they degranulate, releasing toxic enzymes that cause tissue damage. Macrophages are recruited to assist with the phagocytic digestion of bacteria. T-lymphocytes initiate an immune response. Plasma cells, however, are not mentioned in the documents as being involved in the response to plaque-induced gingival inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Plasma cells\"}"
