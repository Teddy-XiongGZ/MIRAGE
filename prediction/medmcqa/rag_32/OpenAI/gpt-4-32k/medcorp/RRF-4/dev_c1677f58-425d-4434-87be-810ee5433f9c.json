These include the site and size of the lesion, which are now considered more carefully to minimize damage to healthy tooth structure (Choice A). The technique and material used are also important aspects of MID, with a focus on using adhesive techniques and materials that promote remineralization (Choice B). The preparation of the cavity is also minimized in MID to preserve as much of the healthy tooth structure as possible (Choice D).

In fact, it aims to reduce cariogenic bacteria and promote remineralization to prevent further tooth decay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
