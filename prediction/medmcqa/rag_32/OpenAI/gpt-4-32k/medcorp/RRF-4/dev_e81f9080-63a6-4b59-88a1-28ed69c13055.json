    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi tendon organ (GTO) is a proprioceptive sensory receptor organ that senses changes in muscle tension. It is connected with a fascicle of 5-25 muscle fibres, contributed by several motor units. This information is provided in Document [2]. Therefore, the statement that the GTO is connected to 3-25 muscle fibres is true. The other options are not accurate. The GTO does not have a high threshold (Document [25]), it does not only respond to dynamic changes (Document [22]), and it does not detect length changes (Document [30]).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
