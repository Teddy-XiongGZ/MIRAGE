    "Step 1: Review the options and identify the relevant information in the documents. Step 2: For option A, Document 14 mentions that fomepizole is used to inhibit the metabolism of methanol to formate, but it does not specify that it is a competitive inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Step 3: For option B, Document 0 states that the median lethal dose of methanol is typically 1\u20132 ml/kg body weight, which is close to the 1.25 ml/kg body weight mentioned in the option. Step 4: For option C, Document 14 also mentions that formic acid is the prime cause of ocular toxicity in methanol poisoning, which supports the statement in the option. Step 5: For option D, none of the documents mention \"snow field vision\" as a symptom of methanol poisoning. Based on the above analysis, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each option and compared it with the information in the documents. While options A, B, and C are supported by the documents, option D is not mentioned in any of the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
