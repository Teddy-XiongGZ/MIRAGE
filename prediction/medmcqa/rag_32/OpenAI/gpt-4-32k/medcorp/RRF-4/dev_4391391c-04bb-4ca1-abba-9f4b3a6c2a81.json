    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a non-healing ulcer on the labia majora that has been biopsied and diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. The size of the lesion is 2x3 cm and there is no palpable lymphadenopathy, which suggests that the cancer may not have spread to the lymph nodes. Given the size and location of the tumor, a wide excision would likely be the most appropriate treatment. Radical vulvectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy might be too aggressive for this case, especially considering the patient's age. Simple vulvectomy might not be sufficient to remove all of the cancerous tissue. Chemoradiation with resection could be an option, but it's typically reserved for more advanced cases or when surgery isn't an option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Wide excision\"}"
