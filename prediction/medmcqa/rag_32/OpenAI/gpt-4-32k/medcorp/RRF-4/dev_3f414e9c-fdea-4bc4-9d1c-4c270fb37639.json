    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's go through each statement one by one. Statement A: The earliest manifestation of digoxin toxicity are gastrointestinal symptoms. This is true according to Document 24 which states that with an acute ingestion, symptoms such as nausea, vertigo, and vomiting are prominent. Statement B: Non-specific vision changes may be noted in digoxin toxicity. This is also true as per Document 24 which mentions vision disturbance as a symptom of digoxin toxicity. Statement C: Early toxicity may not correlate with serum levels and Neurological symptoms may occur without corresponding cardiovascular changes. This is true as well, as Document 26 states that patients with or without digoxin toxicity were not discernible based on their serum digoxin concentration because of a large overlap between toxic and non-toxic groups. Therefore, all statements A, B, and C are true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
