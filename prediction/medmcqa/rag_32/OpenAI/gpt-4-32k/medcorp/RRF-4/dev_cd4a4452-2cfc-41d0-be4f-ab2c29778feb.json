    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Jaundice observed in the first 24 hours is considered pathological and requires intervention. The mother's blood group is 'O' positive, which could indicate a blood group incompatibility, a known risk factor for severe hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, simply observing the jaundice as if it were physiological is not the best course of action. Exchange transfusion is a treatment for severe hyperbilirubinemia, but it's a rather aggressive approach and is typically reserved for cases where other treatments have failed or the bilirubin levels are extremely high. Liver function tests and liver biopsy would be more appropriate if there were indications of liver disease or cholestasis, but the prompt onset of jaundice in this case is more suggestive of a hemolytic process rather than liver disease. Phototherapy is a common and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice and would likely be the first line of treatment in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
