    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyalinization is a term that is often used in the context of orthodontic tooth movement. According to Document [0], hyalinization is considered to be an undesirable side-effect of orthodontic tooth movement. It is not related to the conversion of any tissue into hyaline cartilage. Document [1] also mentions hyalinization as a sterile necrosis at the pressure zone of the periodontal ligament observed during the initial stages of the orthodontic movement. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one that describes hyalinization as a change in the periodontal ligament, not a conversion into hyaline cartilage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
