    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the term for the radio opaque area found at the root apex of young permanent teeth involved with a chronic pulpitis. Looking at the documents, Document [0] mentions that failure cases in teeth treated by pulp mummification were characterized by the radiolucent area or small lesion around apex with clear radiopaque line on the circumference of the area or local increase in the density of bone. This suggests that the radiopaque area could be related to chronic inflammation in the periapex. However, the document does not provide a specific term for this condition. Document [26] mentions that bacterial invasion and colonization of necrotic areas were observed in the pulp of all teeth with carious exposure and symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Bacterial penetration of blood vessels occurred in all cases, suggesting that this may be an important mechanism of spread of bacterial infection through the pulp tissue in an endodontic infection. However, this document also does not provide a specific term for the radiopaque area at the root apex. None of the other documents seem to provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, based on the information available, it is difficult to definitively choose an answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Chronic apical periodontitis\"}"
