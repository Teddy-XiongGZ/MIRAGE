    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Etanercept is a drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. According to Document [18], it reduces the effect of naturally present TNF, and hence is a TNF inhibitor, functioning as a decoy receptor that binds to TNF. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) is a cytokine produced by lymphocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cells. It mediates the immune response by attracting additional white blood cells to sites of inflammation and through additional molecular mechanisms that initiate and amplify inflammation. Inhibition of its action by etanercept reduces the inflammatory response, which is especially useful for treating autoimmune diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
