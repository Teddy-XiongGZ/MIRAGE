According to Document [11], single tooth anterior dental crossbite is a common malocclusion during the development of occlusion in children. Various treatment options such as removable and fixed appliances have been suggested. The paper presents two cases of anterior crossbite corrected using the standard Catlan's appliance (Lower Inclined Bite Plane) in a short period of three weeks without any damage to the tooth or the periodontium.
