    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the range in which 95% of the population's intraocular pressure (IOP) would lie. This is typically calculated using the mean and standard deviation, and the range for 95% of the population is usually within two standard deviations of the mean. Given that the mean is 25 mm Hg and the standard deviation is 10 mm Hg, we can calculate the range as follows: 25 - 2*10 = 5 mm Hg and 25 + 2*10 = 45 mm Hg. However, none of the provided options match this calculation. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question as 10P is not a recognized statistical term. If the question intended to ask for the range in which the IOP of 95% of the population would lie, the calculation provided would be correct. However, based on the provided options, it seems the question might be asking for a different range, possibly within one standard deviation of the mean, which would be 15-35 mm Hg. Again, none of the provided options match this calculation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the provided options\"}"
