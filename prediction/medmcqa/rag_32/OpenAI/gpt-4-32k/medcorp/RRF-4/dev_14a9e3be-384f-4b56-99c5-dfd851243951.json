    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition that develops during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood sugar levels. Document [0] mentions that GDM is associated with an increased level of oxidative stress. Document [1] mentions that GDM is associated with an increased risk of developing Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in women with a history of GDM. Document [2] suggests that women with GDM may be at a greater risk for developing more severe periodontal disease than pregnant women without GDM. Document [4] mentions that old age, a family history of DM, obesity, a high fasting glucose level, and high total cholesterol level were associated with DM development in women without GDM. Document [10] mentions that GDM in a previous pregnancy alone without recurrence may still confer an increased LGA risk. Document [16] mentions that GDM, independent of BMI, was associated with higher abdominal and mid-thigh fat accretion in fetuses. Document [19] mentions that women with GDM are more likely to deliver stillborn or macrosmic babies and may require surgical intervention in order to have normal deliveries. From these documents, it is clear that obesity (option B), hypertension (option C), and macrosomia (option D) are associated with GDM. However, there is no mention of a past history of fetal abnormality (option A) being associated with GDM.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
