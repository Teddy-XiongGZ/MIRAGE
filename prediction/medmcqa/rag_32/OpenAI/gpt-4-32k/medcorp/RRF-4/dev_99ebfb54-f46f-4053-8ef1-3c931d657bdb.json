    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the fixative used to preserve biopsy specimens immediately after they are removed. Document [21] mentions that the most common fixative is formalin. However, it does not specify the concentration. Document [27] also mentions formalin as a fixative but again does not specify the concentration. Therefore, we need to choose between 10% formalin and 1% formalin. Given that no specific concentration is mentioned in the documents, it would be safer to go with the more commonly used concentration in practice, which is 10% formalin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
