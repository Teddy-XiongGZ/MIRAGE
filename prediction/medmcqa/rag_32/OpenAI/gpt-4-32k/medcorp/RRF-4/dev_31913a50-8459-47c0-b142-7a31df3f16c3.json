    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about sensory endings, specifically annulospiral endings, primary endings, 1a fibres, and flower spray. Document [30] mentions annulospiral endings in the context of muscle spindles, but it doesn't provide enough information to verify or refute any of the answer choices. None of the other documents seem to contain relevant information about these specific types of sensory endings. Therefore, I can't definitively choose an answer based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unable to answer based on the provided documents\"}"
