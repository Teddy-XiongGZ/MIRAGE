    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide specific information about the wedging technique to be used when restoring a lower molar with amalgam that has a cavity with a wide buccolingual proximal box. However, the purpose of a wedge in dental procedures is to provide separation of the teeth to allow for proper adaptation of the matrix band and to compensate for the thickness of the matrix band. Given the wide buccolingual space, it might be reasonable to assume that a technique that provides more support and separation would be beneficial. This could potentially be the double wedge technique.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Double wedge\"}"
