    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the color of the bin where a broken ampula is thrown. From the documents, Document [0] provides information about the color scheme of bins according to Australian standard AS4123. It mentions that general waste bins have a red lid, recycling bins have a yellow lid, and green waste bins have a lime green lid. However, it does not specify where a broken ampula would go. Document [6] talks about glass particle contamination from ampules, but it does not mention where the broken ampules are disposed. Document [7] discusses the disposal of needles, syringes, lancets, and reagent strips by diabetic patients, but it does not mention ampules. Document [11] talks about waste collection but does not mention ampules. Document [15] discusses the location of bins for household and recyclable waste, but it does not mention ampules. Document [30] talks about the color of bins in the UK and US, but it does not mention ampules. None of the documents provide a direct answer to the question. However, considering that a broken ampula is likely to be considered as general waste, it would be reasonable to assume that it would be thrown into the bin with a red lid, as per the Australian standard mentioned in Document [0].\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
