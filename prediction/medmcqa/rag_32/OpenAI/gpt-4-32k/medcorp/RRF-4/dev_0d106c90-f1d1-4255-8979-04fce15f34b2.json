    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrous oxide is often used in combination with other anesthetic agents due to its low potency, as mentioned in documents 0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, 14, and 20. It cannot produce anesthesia on its own, which is why it is not used as a sole anesthetic agent. This information helps to eliminate options B, C, and D. Option A, 'Difficulty in maintaining an adequate oxygen concentration', seems to be the most relevant choice. This is because nitrous oxide requires a concentration of 104% to reach one minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), as stated in document 0. This makes it difficult to maintain an adequate oxygen concentration when used alone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
