    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Odontoblasts are described as tall columnar cells located at the periphery of the dental pulp in Document [5]. This suggests that they are tall and columnar in shape, which supports option B. However, there is no information in the documents provided that suggests the size of odontoblastic cells directly depends on the number of dentinal tubules (option A) or that they are squamous in the apical portion (option C). Therefore, option D (all of the above) is also not correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
