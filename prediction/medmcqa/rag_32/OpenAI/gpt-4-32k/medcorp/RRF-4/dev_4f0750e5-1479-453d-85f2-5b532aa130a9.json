    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the volume percentage of filler in a dental composite when the weight percentage is 75%. From Document [2], it is mentioned that a hybrid filler has a filler load of 75-85% by weight. Document [12] further supports this by stating that composites with the highest filler by volume exhibited the highest flexural strength (120 to 129 MPa), flexural modulus (12 to 15 GPa), and hardness (101 to 117 VHN). The filler by volume in this case is 59 to 60%. Therefore, it can be inferred that a 75% weight of filler corresponds to approximately 60% volume of filler.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
