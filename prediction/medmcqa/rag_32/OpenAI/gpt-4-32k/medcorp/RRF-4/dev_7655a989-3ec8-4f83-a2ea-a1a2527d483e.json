    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several reasons why a radiographic examination of a traumatized tooth is essential. Document [1] and [2] mention that obtaining appropriate radiographic images and scans is a key component of the examination process of the traumatized dentition. Document [4] mentions that radiographic examination can help in the management of tooth fractures. Document [6] mentions that radiographic examination is essential to identify the location and extension of the fracture. Document [7] mentions that clinical examination including pulp testing should be supplemented by the taking of routine periapical radiographs. Document [13] mentions that radiographs provide the position and inclination of impaction, diagnostic certainty of the impaction, and its relations with adjacent anatomical structures. Document [14] mentions that radiographic examination is of principal importance in the diagnosis and management of impacted teeth. Document [15] mentions that radiographic evaluation using periapical, occlusal, panoramic radiographs, and cone beam computed tomography is performed to view the effect of trauma on the tooth, root, periodontal ligament, and adjoining bone. Document [16] mentions that imaging modalities, including extraoral and intraoral radiographs and CT scans, can aid in evaluating dental, alveolar, and surrounding fractures. Document [21] and [26] mention that radiographs with multiple views are recommended as they can better reveal the extent and location of the fracture. Document [27] mentions that both classifications have a normal response to pulp vitality tests and tooth mobility testing; however, radiographs of enamel fractures will demonstrate the degree of enamel loss, while enamel infractions will have normal imaging. Document [28] mentions that a CBCT examination of the maxilla was requested to complement the diagnosis, providing an accurate 3D position of the retained tooth and its relationship to adjacent structures. All these points indicate that radiographic examination of a traumatized tooth is essential to establish baseline data, find associated root fracture, and determine the stage of root development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
