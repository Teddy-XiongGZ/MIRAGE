    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the muscle that does not elevate the mandible. From the documents, we know that the masseter (Document [0], [5], [7], [17], [23], [27], [31]), medial pterygoid (Document [0], [7], [18], [27]), and temporalis (Document [0], [10], [19], [27]) muscles all contribute to the elevation of the mandible. However, the digastric muscle, according to Document [24] and Document [30], is involved in the depression of the mandible, which is the opposite of elevation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
