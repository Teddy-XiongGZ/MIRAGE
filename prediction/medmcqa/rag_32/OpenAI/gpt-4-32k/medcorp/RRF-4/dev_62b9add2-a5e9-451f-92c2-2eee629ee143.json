    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a 4-year-old child with a fractured central incisor and a necrotic pulp. The child's age suggests that the tooth is a primary tooth. In such cases, the treatment of choice is usually a pulpectomy, which involves removing the necrotic pulp tissue and filling the root canal. However, gutta percha is not typically used in primary teeth due to the difficulty in resorbing when the permanent tooth is ready to erupt. Instead, a resorbable material like Zinc Oxide Eugenol (ZOE) is often used. Therefore, the answer should be the option that suggests endodontic treatment and root canal filling with ZOE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
