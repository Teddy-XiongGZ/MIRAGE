    "Based on the documents provided, none of them specifically mention the terms \"Intradermal nevus\", \"Junctional nevus\", \"Lichen planus\", or \"Papilloma\". However, from general medical knowledge, we know that a nevus is a type of benign skin lesion, and among the types of nevi, junctional nevi have a higher risk of becoming malignant compared to intradermal nevi. Lichen planus is an inflammatory condition that affects the skin and mucous membranes, and it is not typically associated with an increased risk of malignancy. Papillomas are benign epithelial tumors that grow in a pattern resembling a tree branch, and while some types can become malignant, it's not as common as with junctional nevi. Therefore, the answer choice is B. Junctional nevus. Dict{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"None of the documents mention the specific terms in the question.
