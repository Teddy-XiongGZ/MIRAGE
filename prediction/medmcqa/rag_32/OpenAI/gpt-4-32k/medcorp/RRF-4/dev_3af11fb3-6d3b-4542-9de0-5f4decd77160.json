    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 5'-3' direction refers to the orientation of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA strand. This directionality is vital for many biological processes. DNA replication and transcription both occur in the 5'-3' direction, meaning that new nucleotides are added at the 3' end of the growing strand. DNA repair also occurs in this direction. However, RNA editing does not have a specific directionality as it involves the modification of existing nucleotides rather than the synthesis of a new strand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. RNA editing\"}"
