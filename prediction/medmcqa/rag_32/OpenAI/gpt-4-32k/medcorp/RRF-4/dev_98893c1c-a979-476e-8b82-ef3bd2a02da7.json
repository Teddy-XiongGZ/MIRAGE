    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Weber-Fechner's law is about the relationship between the intensity of a physical stimulus and the perceived intensity of that stimulus. According to the documents, Weber-Fechner's law states that the intensity of our sensation increases as the logarithm of an increase in energy rather than as rapidly as the increase. This means that the perceived intensity of a stimulus is related to the actual intensity of the stimulus, not the number of neurons or receptors stimulated or the amplitude of the action potential.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
