    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcium ions play a crucial role in muscle contraction. According to Document [0], calcium binds to tropomyosin, which allows for the interaction of myosin and actin in the sarcomere, leading to muscle contraction. However, Document [30] provides a more detailed explanation, stating that muscle contraction occurs when calcium, released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, binds to troponin. This binding forces tropomyosin out of the binding site, thus allowing for actin and myosin interaction. Therefore, calcium ions trigger muscle contraction by binding to troponin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Troponin\"}"
