    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Difficulty in opening the mouth in cases of depressed zygomatic arch fracture is often due to impingement of certain structures. According to Document [3], these fractures can trigger a functional alteration in the mouth opening and closing. Document [4] also mentions that mouth opening can be restricted due to impinging of the depressed zygoma onto the condyle. However, Document [18] and Document [30] suggest that the coronoid process can impinge on the denture, resulting in displacement of the prosthesis or restriction of mouth opening. Therefore, the coronoid process seems to be the structure that causes difficulty in opening the mouth in cases of depressed zygomatic arch fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Coronoid process\"}"
