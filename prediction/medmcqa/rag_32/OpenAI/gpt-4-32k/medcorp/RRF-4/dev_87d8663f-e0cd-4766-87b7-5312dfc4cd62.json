    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is a measure of how much a material expands or contracts per unit change in temperature. If the CTE of the ceramic is much lower than that of the metal, it means that the ceramic will expand and contract less than the metal when subjected to changes in temperature. This mismatch in expansion and contraction can lead to stress at the interface between the ceramic and metal, potentially leading to failure. According to Document [22], a general trend in all ceramic systems is to use veneering ceramics of slightly lower thermal expansion coefficients compared with that of the framework resulting in a positive mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient (+DeltaTEC). The concept behind this TEC mismatch is to generate compressive stresses in the weaker veneering ceramic and thus enhance the overall strength of the restoration. However, if the mismatch is too large, it can lead to failure at the interface between the ceramic and metal, which is an adhesive failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
