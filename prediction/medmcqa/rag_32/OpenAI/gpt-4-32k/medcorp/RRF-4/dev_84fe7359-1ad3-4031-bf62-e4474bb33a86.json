    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition characterized by a long-standing left-to-right cardiac shunt caused by a congenital heart defect, which eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension and reversal of the shunt into a cyanotic right-to-left shunt. This condition is associated with several signs and symptoms. An increased flow murmur across the tricuspid and pulmonary valve could be a sign of increased blood flow due to the shunt. A single S2 (second heart sound) could be a sign of the shunt reversal, as the normal splitting of the second heart sound may be lost due to the altered blood flow. A loud P2 (pulmonic component of the second heart sound) could be a sign of increased pressure in the pulmonary artery due to pulmonary hypertension. However, a Graham steel murmur, which is a diastolic murmur heard at the left sternal border due to pulmonary regurgitation, is not typically associated with Eisenmenger syndrome. This murmur is more commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension without a shunt.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
