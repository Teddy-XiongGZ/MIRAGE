    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why an elastic impression is washed with a slurry of water and stone before it is poured. Looking at the documents, none of them mention washing an elastic impression with a slurry of water and stone. However, Document [1] mentions that all impressions should be thoroughly rinsed with water after disinfection to prevent incorporation of disinfectant in the cast. This suggests that the purpose of washing the impression is to remove any substances that could interfere with the casting process. Therefore, the most likely answer is that the impression is washed to remove saliva, which could potentially distort the cast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
