    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The assertion states that the distal pole of the scaphoid goes to avascular necrosis after a scaphoid fracture. However, according to Document [1], avascular necrosis (AVN) of the scaphoid predominantly occurs in the proximal pole, not the distal pole. Therefore, the assertion is false. The reason states that the blood supply of the scaphoid is from distal to proximal. This is confirmed by Document [0], which states that the scaphoid receives its arterial supply in a retrograde fashion, i.e., from distal to proximal pole. Therefore, the reason is true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Reason is true but asseion is false\"}"
