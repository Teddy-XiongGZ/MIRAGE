    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] provides a clear guideline for the management of an avulsed tooth. It states that if the extraoral dry time is less than 20 minutes, the tooth should be gently washed and replanted immediately. Scrubbing the tooth could potentially damage the periodontal ligament cells on the root surface, which are vital for the reattachment of the tooth to the socket. Therefore, the tooth should not be scrubbed. Also, the document does not mention the need for immediate root canal treatment (RCT) before replantation in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Rinse with saline and reimplant\"}"
