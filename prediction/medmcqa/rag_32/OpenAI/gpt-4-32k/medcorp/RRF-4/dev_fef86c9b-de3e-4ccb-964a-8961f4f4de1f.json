    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the material that is carried in a custom tray. Looking at the documents, Document [23] mentions that custom trays are used for making impressions with elastomeric products. Document [28] also mentions that custom trays are used with elastomeric impression materials. However, none of the documents specifically mention high fusing compound, reversible hydrocolloid, metallic oxide paste, or irreversible hydrocolloid being carried in a custom tray. Therefore, I need to know what these materials are and if they are elastomeric. High fusing compound is not an elastomeric material. Reversible hydrocolloid is a type of impression material, but it's not elastomeric. Metallic oxide paste is also not an elastomeric material. Irreversible hydrocolloid, however, is a type of elastomeric impression material. Therefore, it is the most likely to be carried in a custom tray.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Irreversible hydrocolloid\"}"
