    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking which statement about the trigeminal nerve is not true. Step 2: Review each answer choice in relation to the documents provided. Choice A: Roots of trigeminal nerve are attached to Pons. Document [29] mentions that the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve emerges from the trigeminal ganglion and exits the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale. However, it does not mention the Pons. Choice B: It has three main divisions. This is mentioned in several documents, including Document [2] and Document [19], which state that the trigeminal nerve has three major branches or divisions. Choice C: Trigeminal nerve supplies the dura mater of middle cranial fossa. This is not mentioned in any of the documents. Choice D: The trigeminal ganglion contributes to the sensory root only. Document [29] contradicts this statement, mentioning that the mandibular nerve, a division of the trigeminal nerve, contains both afferent and efferent fibers. Step 3: Based on the information in the documents, the statement that is not true is Choice D: The trigeminal ganglion contributes to the sensory root only. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each answer choice in relation to the documents provided. Choice A is not directly mentioned in the documents, but it is a known fact in neuroanatomy. Choice B is confirmed by several documents. Choice C is not mentioned in the documents, but it is a known fact in neuroanatomy. Choice D is contradicted by Document [29], which mentions that the mandibular nerve, a division of the trigeminal nerve, contains both afferent and efferent fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
