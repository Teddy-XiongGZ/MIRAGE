    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart, usually the valves. It is common to find infective endocarditis as a complication of congenital heart disease or rheumatic heart disease. ASD, TOF, VSD, and MR are all heart conditions. ASD (Atrial Septal Defect), TOF (Tetralogy of Fallot), and VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect) are congenital heart diseases, while MR (Mitral Regurgitation) is a valvular heart disease. Therefore, infective endocarditis can potentially occur in all of these conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
