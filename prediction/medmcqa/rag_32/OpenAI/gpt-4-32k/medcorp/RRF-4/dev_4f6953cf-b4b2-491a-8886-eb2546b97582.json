    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the reason for incomplete debridement in the case of a deep carious lesion. Debridement is the removal of damaged or infected tissue. In the case of a deep carious lesion, incomplete debridement is done to prevent pulp exposure and allow a thin layer of a dentin to remain. This is supported by Document [24] which states that the carious lesion should be treated in a way that allows to arrest its activity, while preserving sound tooth tissue and pulp vitality. Document [26] also supports this by stating that deep carious lesions were often associated with severe pulp inflammation and infection, and a radiographic threshold between deep and extremely deep lesions is suggested as an indicator of the bacterial penetration level and the severity of the pulpal response prior to intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
