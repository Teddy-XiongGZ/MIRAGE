    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prions are infectious agents that cause neurodegenerative diseases. They are composed of misfolded proteins and lack any informational nucleic acids, as stated in Document [18]. This means they do not contain DNA or RNA, ruling out option D. Prions are known for their resistance to inactivation, as mentioned in Document [7], which means they are not readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC, ruling out option A. Prions do not evoke a strong immunogenic reaction, as they are composed of a host's own proteins and thus do not trigger a strong immune response, ruling out option B. Lastly, prions are known for their long incubation periods, as stated in Document [17], which rules out option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above options are correct.\"}"
