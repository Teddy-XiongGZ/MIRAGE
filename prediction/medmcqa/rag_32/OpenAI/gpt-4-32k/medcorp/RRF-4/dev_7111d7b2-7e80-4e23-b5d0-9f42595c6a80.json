    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"2,3-BPG is an important regulator of the binding of O2 to hemoglobin. It binds to deoxyhemoglobin and decreases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. This means that when 2,3-BPG binds to hemoglobin, it makes it harder for oxygen to bind to hemoglobin, thus decreasing its affinity for oxygen. Hemoglobin has four binding sites for oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 4, decreases\"}"
