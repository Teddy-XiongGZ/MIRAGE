    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the criteria for considering a high endemic area for meningococcal meningitis according to the WHO. Document [7] states that the incidence of endemic meningococcal disease during the last 13 years ranges from 1 to 5 per 100,000 in developed countries, and from 10 to 25 per 100,000 in developing countries. During epidemics, the incidence of meningococcal disease approaches 100 per 100,000. This suggests that a high endemic area would have an incidence rate of more than 10 per 100,000 population.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
