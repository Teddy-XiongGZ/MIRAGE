    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fetal lung maturity is a crucial factor in determining the readiness of a fetus for birth. It is typically assessed through various tests that measure the presence and concentration of lung surfactant, a substance that prevents the lungs from collapsing. The Lecithin/Sphingomyelin ratio >2 (Choice A) is a well-known indicator of fetal lung maturity, as lecithin is a major component of surfactant and its increase relative to sphingomyelin is a sign of lung maturity. A positive shake test (Choice B) is another indicator of lung maturity. It is a test that measures the ability of amniotic fluid to generate stable foam, which is a sign of sufficient surfactant. Increased phosphatidyl glycerol (Choice C) is also a sign of lung maturity, as it is a component of surfactant. However, the presence of blue cells in the Nile Blue Test (Choice D) is not mentioned in any of the provided documents as an indicator of fetal lung maturity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
