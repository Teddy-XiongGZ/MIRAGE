    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that etomidate can cause adrenal suppression. Document [0] states that etomidate is able to block adrenal 11 hydroxylase, which is involved in corticosteroid synthesis. Document [3] also mentions that etomidate suppresses corticosteroid synthesis in the adrenal cortex, leading to adrenal suppression. Document [6] further supports this by stating that etomidate infusion completely blocked the adrenocortical response to corticotropin stimulation. On the other hand, the documents do not mention any adrenal suppression effects for midazolam, thiopentone, or propofol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Etomidate\"}"
