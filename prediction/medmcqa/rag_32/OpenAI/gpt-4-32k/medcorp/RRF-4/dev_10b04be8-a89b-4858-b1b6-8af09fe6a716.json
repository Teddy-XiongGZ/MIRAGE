    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that both passive and carrier-mediated processes contribute to drug transport across biological membranes. Passive diffusion is a process where drugs move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration without the need for energy. Facilitated diffusion also moves drugs from high to low concentration, but it requires a carrier protein to facilitate the process. Active transport, on the other hand, moves drugs against a concentration gradient, which requires energy. Endocytosis is a process where the cell membrane engulfs a drug to bring it into the cell. While all these processes can occur, the documents suggest that passive diffusion and carrier-mediated processes (which include facilitated diffusion and active transport) are the major mechanisms. Therefore, it's not accurate to single out one process as the major mechanism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"E. All of the above\"}"
