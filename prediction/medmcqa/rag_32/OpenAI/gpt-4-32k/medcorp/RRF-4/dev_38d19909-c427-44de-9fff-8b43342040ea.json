    "The net filtration pressure can be calculated using the formula mentioned in Document [0]: PUF = PGC - PBS - \u03c0GC. According to Document [1], the oncotic pressure in Bowman\u2019s space (\u03c0BS) is near zero because no proteins are filtered. Therefore, the formula simplifies to PUF = PGC - PBS. Substituting the given values, we get PUF = 42 mm Hg - 16 mm Hg = 26 mm Hg. However, this option is not available in the choices. Therefore, the data provided is not sufficient to choose a correct answer from the given options. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The net filtration pressure can be calculated using the formula: PUF = PGC - PBS - \u03c0GC.
