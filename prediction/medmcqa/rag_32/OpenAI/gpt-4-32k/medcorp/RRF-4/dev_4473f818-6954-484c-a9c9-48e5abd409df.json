    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reticulocytosis is a condition where there is an increase in reticulocytes, immature red blood cells. It is commonly seen in anemia. They are seen on blood films when the bone marrow is highly active in an attempt to replace red blood cell loss such as in haemolytic anaemia, haemorrhage. Hemolytic anemia is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the bloodstream before their normal lifespan is over. This leads to an increase in the production of reticulocytes to replace the lost red blood cells. On the other hand, megaloblastic anemia, aplastic anemia, and iron deficiency anemia are all conditions that result in a decreased reticulocyte count because they result in decreased hemoglobin synthesis or bone marrow failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
