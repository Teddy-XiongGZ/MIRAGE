    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of increased temperature from a soldering torch on the properties of a cobalt-chromium crown. From the documents, it is clear that heat treatment can affect the mechanical properties of cobalt-chromium alloys. Specifically, Document [4] mentions that heat treatment at certain temperatures can increase the bending rigidity and reduce the permanent deformation of the alloy. This suggests that the yield strength, or the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically, would increase. On the other hand, the percent elongation, or the strain at fracture, would decrease as the material becomes more rigid and less ductile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
