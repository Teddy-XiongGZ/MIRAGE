    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fetal fibronectin is a protein that is produced by fetal cells and is present at the interface of the chorion and decidua. It is normally found in cervicovaginal secretions up until 22 weeks of gestation, after which it disappears until shortly before delivery. Its presence in cervicovaginal secretions between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation is a strong predictor of preterm labor. The patient in the question is 32 weeks pregnant and is experiencing labor pains. The presence of fetal fibronectin in her cervicovaginal discharge suggests that she is likely experiencing preterm labor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
