    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the percentage of mandibular incisors that have a single apical foramen. Document [3] states that single-rooted incisors showed in 80% 1 physiological foramen. Document [4] states that the majority of mandibular central incisors had a single canal (61% possessed a Type I canal system). Although 39% of the roots possessed two canals, only 8.8% had two separate apical foramina. Document [5] states that greater than 85% of the root canals possessed a single canal (Type I). Document [14] states that the majority of mandibular central incisors had a single canal (61% possessed a Type I canal system). Although 39% of the roots possessed two canals, only 8.8% had two separate apical foramina. Document [16] states that the incidence of one apical foramen was highest in distobuccal roots of the maxillary first molars and was lowest in the maxillary first premolars with single roots. The distance of deviation in all the teeth was between 0.271-0.519 mm. The frequency of accessory foramina was between 30-70% for the various tooth types. Document [17] states that almost all of the teeth in the anatomic studies were single-rooted (99.6%). The incidence of 2 roots (0.3%) and 3 roots (0.1%) was extremely rare. Anatomic studies of the internal canal morphology found that a single canal was present in 91.0% of the teeth. A single apical foramen was found in 91.8% of the teeth. Document [24] states that mandibular incisors are the smallest human permanent teeth with complex root canals. Double root canal, lateral branch of root canal, apical ramification or apical furcation usually happen, which make the clinical therapy more difficult. In this paper, a case of mandibular incisors with double root canals was reported, the root canal type and its incidence were discussed. Document [30] states that all teeth studied displayed single root with single root canal conforming to type I Vertucci's classification. Root length of CI was significantly shorter than both LI and C, with no significant difference between LI and C. Straight root canals were more common in CI and LI, whereas curved canals were more common in C. S-shaped canals were seen in a few CI and C. BL canal width was more than MD width in all teeth, C showing significantly larger dimensions than both CI and LI. This study presents root and root canal characteristics of primary mandibular central incisor, lateral incisor, and canine in children from Indian ethnicity. Based on these documents, the percentage of mandibular incisors with a single apical foramen ranges from 80% to 91.8%. Therefore, none of the answer choices exactly match the data from the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 60%- 78%\"}"
