    "Step 1: Review the documents for information on the features of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Step 2: Document [1] mentions that JIA is characterized by chronic joint inflammation. Step 3: Document [5] mentions that symptoms of JIA vary from individual to individual, but it is usually recognized by swelling, pain, stiffness, and restricted joint movement. Step 4: Document [28] mentions that children with the Systemic JIA subtype often experience extra-articular manifestations including fever, rash, enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen, serositis, and anaemia. Step 5: Document [19] mentions that Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which is one of the most frequent disease subtypes, is characterized by recurrent fever and rash. Step 6: Document [22] mentions that oligoarticular JIA is the most frequent one and the prognosis may be further complicated by the presence of uveitis. Step 7: None of the documents mention Rheumatoid nodule or Raynaud's phenomenon as a feature of JIA. Based on the information from the documents, the answer is either Rheumatoid nodule or Raynaud's phenomenon. However, Rheumatoid nodules are typically associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, not JIA. Therefore, the answer is Raynaud's phenomenon. Output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first reviewed the documents for information on the features of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).
