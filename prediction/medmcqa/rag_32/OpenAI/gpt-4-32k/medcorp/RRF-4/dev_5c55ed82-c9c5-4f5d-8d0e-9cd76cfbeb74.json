    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At 6 weeks of gestation, the most accurate method to diagnose pregnancy would be one that can detect the presence of the fetus and its cardiac activity. Doppler assessment of fetal cardiac activity can be used, but it might not be as accurate or reliable at this early stage of pregnancy. Urinary Beta-hCG determination can confirm pregnancy, but it does not provide information about the location of the pregnancy or the viability of the fetus. Per vaginal examination of uterine size is not a reliable method to confirm pregnancy as the size of the uterus can vary and it does not provide information about the fetus. Ultrasound for fetal cardiac activity is a reliable and safe method to diagnose pregnancy at 6 weeks as it can visualize the fetus and detect its cardiac activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
