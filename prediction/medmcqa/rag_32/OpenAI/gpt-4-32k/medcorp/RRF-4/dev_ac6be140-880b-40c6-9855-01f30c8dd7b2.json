    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcium hydroxide is a material that is often used in pulpotomy procedures. When applied to the pulp tissue, it dissociates into calcium and hydroxyl ions. The calcium ions are known to stimulate the formation of a mineralized bridge over the pulp tissue, as mentioned in Document 22.
