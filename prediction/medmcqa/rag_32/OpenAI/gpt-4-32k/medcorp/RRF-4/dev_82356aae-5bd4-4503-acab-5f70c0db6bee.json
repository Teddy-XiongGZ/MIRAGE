    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Idiosyncratic side effects are those that are unpredictable and vary among individuals, often due to genetic differences. Document [13] explains that idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions are unpredictable and thought to have an underlying genetic etiology. Document [17] mentions that carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome is associated with a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, indicating that it is an idiosyncratic reaction. Document [0] and Document [24] mention that agranulocytosis and rash are rare side effects of carbamazepine, suggesting that they are idiosyncratic. However, Document [1] and Document [21] mention that blurred vision is a common side effect of carbamazepine, suggesting that it is not idiosyncratic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Blurred vision\"}"
