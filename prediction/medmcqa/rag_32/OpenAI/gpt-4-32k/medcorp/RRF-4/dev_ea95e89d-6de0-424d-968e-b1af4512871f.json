    "First, we need to calculate the risk in each group. The risk is calculated as the number of people who developed hypertension complications divided by the total number of people in the group. For the control group (old drug), the risk is 1800/15225 = 0.1182 or 11.82%. For the intervention group (new drug), the risk is 1620/15225 = 0.1063 or 10.63%. Next, we calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference in risk between the control group and the intervention group. ARR = 11.82% - 10.63% = 1.19% or approximately 1%. Finally, we calculate the relative risk (RR), which is the risk in the intervention group divided by the risk in the control group. RR = 10.63% / 11.82% = 0.899 or approximately 0.9. So, the answer is ARR = 1% and RR = 0.9. Therefore, the correct answer is C. ARR = 1% and RR = 0.9. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I calculated the risk in each group by dividing the number of people who developed hypertension complications by the total number of people in the group.
