    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effectiveness duration of CHX mouthwash daily use for 2 weeks against Streptococcus mutans. To answer this question, I need to find information about how long the effects of CHX mouthwash last after a 2-week daily use. Document [2] suggests that the combination of CHX mouthwash and Xylitol Chewing Gum showed maximum reduction in S. mutans scores throughout the study period of 6 months. However, it does not provide specific information about the duration of CHX mouthwash's effectiveness alone. Document [10] suggests that the effect of CHX disappeared after 1 month and gradually reached the base line. This suggests that the effectiveness of CHX mouthwash may last for about 1 month after a 2-week daily use. None of the documents provide information that suggests the effectiveness of CHX mouthwash can last for 12 weeks or more after a 2-week daily use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
