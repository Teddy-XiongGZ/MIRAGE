    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that appendicitis is a common problem in children and its diagnosis can be challenging. The use of imaging has been highlighted in the diagnosis of appendicitis. While CT scans have been mentioned to have superior accuracy, the health risks of exposing children to radiation make it less preferable. Ultrasound, on the other hand, is mentioned as the preferred first choice in multiple documents due to its lower cost, lack of ionizing radiation, and ability to assess ovarian pathology that can often mimic acute appendicitis in female patients. Therefore, Ultrasound (USG) seems to be the best diagnostic investigation for acute appendicitis in children.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
