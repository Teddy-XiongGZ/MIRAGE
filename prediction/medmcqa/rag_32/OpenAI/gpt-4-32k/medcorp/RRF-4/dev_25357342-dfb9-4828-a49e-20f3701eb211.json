    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cleft palate patients often have speech problems due to the physical structure of their palate. This is often due to the inability of the soft palate to close tightly against the back of the throat during speech, resulting in incomplete velopharyngeal closure. This is mentioned in Document [22]. This can result in hypernasality, hyponasality, or a mixed nasal resonance.
