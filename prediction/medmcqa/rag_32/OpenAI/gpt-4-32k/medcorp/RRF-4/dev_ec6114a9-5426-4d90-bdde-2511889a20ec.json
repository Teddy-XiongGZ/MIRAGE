    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of progressive lower limb weakness, spasticity, and recent onset hesitancy of micturition, along with the evidence of dorsal myelopathy on neurological examination, suggest a spinal cord issue. The MRI scan further confirms this with the finding of a middorsal intradural contrast enhancing mass lesion. Looking at the options, intradural lipoma, dermoid cyst, meningioma, and epidermoid cyst are all potential causes of such symptoms and MRI findings. However, meningiomas are the most common intradural tumors and are known to enhance with contrast on MRI, which matches the patient's MRI findings. Therefore, meningioma is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
