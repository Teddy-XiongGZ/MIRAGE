    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several bacteria that are associated with the progression of dental caries. Actinomyces spp. is mentioned in several documents as being associated with dental caries (Documents 3, 4, 7, 13, 18, 19, 25, 28). However, it's not the only bacteria mentioned. Proteolytic bacteria are not specifically mentioned in the context of dental caries. Acidogenic bacteria are mentioned in several documents (Documents 2, 6, 12, 17, 18, 28, 30) as being associated with the progression of dental caries. Gram positive bacteria are mentioned in Document 19, but it's not specific to the progression of dental caries. Based on the frequency and context in which they are mentioned, it seems that Acidogenic bacteria are most directly associated with the progression of dental caries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Acidogenic bacteria\"}"
