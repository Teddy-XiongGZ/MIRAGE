    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [2] mentions that the aspirational biopsy of odontogenic keratocysts contains a greasy fluid which is pale in color and contains keratotic squames. Protein content of cyst fluid below 4g% is diagnostic of odontogenic keratocysts. This suggests that the protein content in the aspirate from a keratocyst is low. Document [22] also supports this by stating that the levels of albumin, prealbumin, total protein, inorganic phosphate and presence of keratinocytes in the cystic fluid can be used for the diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning of keratocystic odontogenic tumours and other non keratinizing odontogenic cysts. The presence of cholesterol crystal clefts in cell block slides was correlated with cystic lesions, and the parakeratin presence was a KOT indicator. This suggests that the aspirate from a keratocyst will have cholesterol crystal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Cholesterol crystal\"}"
