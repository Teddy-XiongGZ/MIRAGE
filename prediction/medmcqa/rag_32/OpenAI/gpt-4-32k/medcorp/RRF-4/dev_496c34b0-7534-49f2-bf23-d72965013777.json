    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The blade-/plate-form implant is the only endosseous implant which has proved to be successful under three different types of integration: fibrous integration, fibro-osseous integration, and osseous integration. Osseous integration is when there is 23% or more direct bone-to-implant contact, with no evidence of fibrous connective tissue anywhere. Fibro-osseous integration is when there is a combination of thinly defined fibrous connection with 22% or less direct bone contact with the implant. Therefore, the integration between blade vent implant and bone can be either fibro-osseous integration or osseous integration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Fibto-oeseous integration, B. Osseo-integration\"}"
