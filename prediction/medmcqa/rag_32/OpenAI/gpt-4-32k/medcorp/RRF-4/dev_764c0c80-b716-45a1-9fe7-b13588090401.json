    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The central value of a set of values is typically represented by the median. The median is the middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data set. In terms of percentiles, quartiles, and deciles, the median is the 50th percentile, the 2nd quartile, and the 5th decile.
