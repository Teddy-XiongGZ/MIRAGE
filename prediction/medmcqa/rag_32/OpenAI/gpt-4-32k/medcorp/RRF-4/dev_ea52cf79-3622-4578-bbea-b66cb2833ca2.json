    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the age at which the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) develops. Document [11] states that the jaw, which includes the TMJ, begins to develop from the fourth week. However, this does not specify the exact time when the TMJ is fully developed. Document [30] provides more specific information, stating that the TMJ anatomy and measurements appear to be related and agree with the neuro-muscular maturation time at which sucking and swallowing reflexes begin before birth, which is fully attained at about 20 weeks of development. Therefore, it can be inferred that the TMJ is fully developed around the 20th week.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
