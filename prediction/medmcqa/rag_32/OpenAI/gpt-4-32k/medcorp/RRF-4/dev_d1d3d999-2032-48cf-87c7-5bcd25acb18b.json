    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ritonavir is known to inhibit the metabolism of many drugs by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, as stated in Document [0], [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Amiodarone is metabolized by CYP3A4, so it would be affected by ritonavir (Document [3]). Cisapride is also metabolized by CYP3A4, so it would be affected by ritonavir (Document [14]). Midazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, so it would be affected by ritonavir (Document [19]). However, Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, not CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. Therefore, its metabolism would not be significantly affected by ritonavir.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Phenytoin\"}"
