    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the Indian Penal Code (IPC) section that makes embalming without issuing a death certificate punishable. Looking at the documents, none of them directly mention a specific IPC section that makes embalming without issuing a death certificate punishable. However, Document 24 mentions Section 297 of the IPC, which deals with 'Trespassing on burial places, etc.' This section punishes those who commit any trespass in any place set apart from the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse. Although it doesn't directly mention embalming without a death certificate, it seems to be the closest match among the options provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
