    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the anterior teeth where the mesiodistal size is more than the cervicoincisal dimension. Looking at the documents, Document [3] and Document [18] mention that the deciduous maxillary central incisor has a mesiodistal diameter that is greater than the length cervicoincisally, which makes the tooth appear wider rather than taller. However, this option is not available in the choices. Document [9] mentions that the primary lateral incisor crown is wider mesiodistally than the permanent tooth, which could suggest that the deciduous upper lateral incisor might have a mesiodistal size more than its cervicoincisal dimension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Deciduous upper lateral incisor\"}"
