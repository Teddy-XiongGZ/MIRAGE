    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the risk of Down syndrome in a child if the mother has a 21/21 chromosomal translocation. From Document [0], we learn that the parent with such a translocation has a higher chance of creating reproductive cells with extra chromosome 21 material, which can lead to Down syndrome. The document also mentions that this results in a 15% chance of having a child with Down syndrome when the mother is affected. However, this statistic is for a Robertsonian translocation, not specifically a 21/21 translocation. Document [18] also mentions that translocation Down syndrome is often referred to as familial Down syndrome and it is the cause of about 4.5% of the observed Down syndromes. It does not show the maternal age effect, and is just as likely to have come from fathers as mothers. However, none of the documents provide a specific risk percentage for a 21/21 chromosomal translocation. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer this question with the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"N/A\"}"
