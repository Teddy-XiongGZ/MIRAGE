    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anatomical snuff box is a surface anatomy characteristic located on the lateral part of the wrist. It is where the radial artery can be easily palpated. It is bounded anteriorly by the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons and posteriorly by the extensor pollicis longus tendon. The scaphoid and trapezium bones lie on the floor of the snuff box and can be injured when a person falls on an outstretched hand. Tenderness to palpation in the anatomical snuffbox after a fall on an outstretched hand indicates a scaphoid fracture. Therefore, if the patient is experiencing pain in the anatomical snuff box area after a fall, it is likely that they have a scaphoid fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Scaphoid fracture\"}"
