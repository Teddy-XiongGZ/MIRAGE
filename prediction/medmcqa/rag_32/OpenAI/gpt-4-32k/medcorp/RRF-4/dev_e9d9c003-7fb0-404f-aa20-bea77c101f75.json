    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has been vomiting repeatedly, which according to Document [0], can cause metabolic alkalosis due to the loss of hydrochloric acid in the stomach contents. This can also lead to a loss of potassium as per Document [3]. Therefore, the treatment should aim to replenish the lost electrolytes and correct the alkalosis. According to Document [13], a trial of intravenous chloride-rich fluid is warranted if there is a high index of suspicion for chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis caused by loss of gastrointestinal fluid due to vomiting. Normal saline is a chloride-rich fluid that can help correct the metabolic alkalosis. Additionally, potassium supplementation is necessary to correct the hypokalemia caused by the vomiting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. I.V. normal saline and potassium\"}"
