    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the characteristic features of high copper amalgam alloy. Step 2: Review the answer choices. The choices are about the compressive strength, marginal breakdown, marginal, and creep of high copper amalgam alloy. Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [2] mentions that high copper amalgams show 'superior' physical properties and clinical performance to low copper amalgams. It also mentions that high copper amalgams have less marginal breakdown. Document [1] mentions that high copper amalgams showed higher one hour compressive strengths, lower creep than low copper amalgams. Step 4: Match the information from the documents to the answer choices. Based on the information from the documents, high copper amalgam alloy has high compressive strength (contradicting choice A), less marginal breakdown (contradicting choice B), and low creep (contradicting choice D). The documents do not provide information about choice C. Step 5: Choose the answer that is supported by the documents. The only choice that is not contradicted by the documents is choice C. Based on these steps, the answer is choice C. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the characteristic features of high copper amalgam alloy. The documents mention that high copper amalgam alloy has high compressive strength, less marginal breakdown, and low creep. The only choice that is not contradicted by the documents is choice C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
