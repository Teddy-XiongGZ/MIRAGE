    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-translational modification is a process that alters the properties of a protein by adding, changing, or removing certain chemical groups from the amino acids that make up the protein. From the documents, we can see that hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are formed by post-translational modification (Document 0 and Document 4). Selenocysteine is a proteinogenic amino acid that can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms (Document 7). Triiodothyronine is not incorporated into proteins, but it is not clear from the documents whether it undergoes post-translational modification. Therefore, based on the information provided, Triiodothyronine is the amino acid that does not include post-translational modification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
