    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mean and standard deviation are statistical measures that require numerical data. The interval/ratio scale is a numerical scale where the order and the exact differences between the values are known. This scale allows for a wide range of statistical analyses to be applied, including the calculation of the mean and standard deviation. On the other hand, the dichotomous scale, nominal scale, and ordinal scale are categorical scales. The dichotomous scale is a binary scale (e.g., yes/no, true/false). The nominal scale is a naming scale, where variables are simply 'named' or 'labeled', with no specific order. The ordinal scale is a ranking scale where data can be sorted, but differences between data are not uniform. For these scales, it is not possible to calculate a mean or standard deviation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
