    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor organ that senses changes in muscle tension. It is located at the musculotendinous junction and provides the sensory component of the Golgi tendon reflex. When the muscle generates force, the sensory terminals of the Golgi tendon organ are compressed. This stretching deforms the terminals of the Ib afferent axon, opening stretch-sensitive cation channels. As a result, the Ib axon is depolarized and fires nerve impulses that are propagated to the spinal cord. The action potential frequency signals the force being developed by the muscle. Therefore, the Golgi tendon organ does not relay information about the length of the muscle at rest, the change in angle of joint during motion, or the change in length of muscle before and after the movement. Instead, it continuously relays information about the tension in the muscle to the efferent neurons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
