    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The nasal septum receives blood supply from several arteries. According to Document 10, the external carotid gives rise to the facial and maxillary arteries, the terminal branches of which provide the remaining vascular supply; the facial artery branches form the superior labial artery, which supplies the anterior aspect of the nose. The maxillary artery branches form the greater palatine and sphenopalatine arteries, which supply the inferior and posterior septum. Therefore, the sphenopalatine, greater palatine, and superior labial arteries are branches of the external carotid artery that supply the nasal septum. However, the anterior ethmoidal artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery, as stated in Document 15.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
