    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The refractive power of the eye is determined by the cornea and the lens. The cornea provides the majority of the eye's focusing power. The anterior surface of the cornea has the most significant refractive power due to its curvature and difference in refractive index from the air. The posterior surface of the cornea, the anterior surface of the lens, and the posterior surface of the lens also contribute to the refractive power, but to a lesser extent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
