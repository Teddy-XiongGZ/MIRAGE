    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disease. According to Document [2], histological findings characteristic of oral lichen planus include hydropic degeneration of the basal layer, lymphocytic infiltration in the subepithelial layer and the absence of epithelial dysplasia. Document [8] also mentions that in all groups T lymphocytes were predominant. Document [13] mentions a mixed lichenoid inflammatory infiltrate, consisting of eosinophils and plasma cells. Document [22] also mentions the presence of a mixed cellular inflammatory infiltrate. Therefore, the histopathologic study of lichen planus shows both a mixed cellular inflammatory infiltrate and a predominance of T-Lymphocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Mixed cellular inflammatory infiltrate, B. Presence of T-Lymphocytes predominantly\"}"
