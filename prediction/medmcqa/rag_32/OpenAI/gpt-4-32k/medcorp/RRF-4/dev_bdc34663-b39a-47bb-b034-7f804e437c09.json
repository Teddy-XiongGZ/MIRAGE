    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been on haloperidol for many days and recently developed inner restlessness and urges to move. According to Document [30], akathisia is a condition that can emerge after days to months of haloperidol usage and is characterized by a sensation of restlessness. Tardive dyskinesia, on the other hand, emerges after several years and is characterized by choreiform movements, particularly in the orofacial region. Rabbit syndrome is a rare form of extrapyramidal side effect associated with long-term use of antipsychotic drugs, characterized by rapid movements of the lips resembling the chewing movements of a rabbit, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. Acute dystonia develops within hours to days of initiation and may manifest as muscle spasms, stiffness, or even oculogyric crisis, which also does not match the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the patient's symptoms align most closely with akathisia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
