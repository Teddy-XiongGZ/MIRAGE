    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CLED media is often used in the detection of urinary tract infections. It is a non-selective media, meaning it allows the growth of a wide range of microorganisms, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This is mentioned in Document [0]. However, one of the key advantages of CLED media over MacConkey media is its ability to inhibit the swarming of Proteus species, which can often overgrow other organisms on the plate. This is not explicitly stated in the documents, but it is a well-known characteristic of CLED media in the field of microbiology.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
