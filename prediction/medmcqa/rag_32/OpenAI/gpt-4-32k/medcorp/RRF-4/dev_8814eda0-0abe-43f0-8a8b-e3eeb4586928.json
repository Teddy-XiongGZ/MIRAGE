    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the anterior pituitary hormone that is primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. From the documents, we know that the hypothalamus can both stimulate and inhibit the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary. Looking at the options, TSH (Thyroid-stimulating hormone) and GRH (Growth hormone-releasing hormone) are stimulated by the hypothalamus, not inhibited. Somatostatin is not a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary, but by the hypothalamus itself to inhibit other hormones. Prolactin, however, is produced by the anterior pituitary and its secretion is primarily inhibited by the hypothalamus through dopamine, also known as prolactin inhibiting hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Prolactin\"}"
