    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Juvenile periodontitis is characterized by rapid destruction of the periodontal tissues. According to Document [0], the aetiology of the disease includes bacterial infection, defects in the host defense system, and heredity. Document [3] suggests that virulent gram-negative microorganisms, selective immune deficiencies, dysfunction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, genetic predisposition, or any combination of these could be possible etiologic factors. Document [9] mentions that a major infecting organism, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, is strongly associated with the disease. It is virulent with marked leukaggressive properties and it induces a marked antibody response in infected patients. Document [19] explains that the destruction occurs as a result of the effect of bacterial endotoxins on bone tissue. Therefore, the cause of bone destruction in juvenile periodontitis is highly virulent microorganisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
