    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are methods of birth control that provide effective contraception for an extended period without requiring user action. They include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal contraceptive implants. Copper T, LNG-IUS, and Implanon are all types of LARCs. However, Laparoscopic tubal ligation is a surgical procedure for sterilization in which a woman's fallopian tubes are clamped, blocked, or severed and sealed. This procedure is permanent and not reversible, thus it is not a long-acting reversible contraceptive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
