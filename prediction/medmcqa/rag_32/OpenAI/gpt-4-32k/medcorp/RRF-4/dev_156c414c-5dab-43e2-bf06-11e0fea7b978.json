    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what post-operative endocarditis is. From the documents, I learned that post-operative endocarditis is an infection that occurs after heart surgery, particularly valve replacement. It can occur early, within the first two months after surgery, or late, after that period. The bacteria causing this infection can be different depending on the timing. Early post-operative endocarditis is usually caused by staphylococci, which are acquired in the operating theatre or in the intensive therapy unit. Late post-operative endocarditis has similar infecting organisms to those causing native valve endocarditis, predominantly streptococci. The commonest source of these organisms is the mouth. Now, looking at the answer choices, Streptococcus viridans is a type of streptococci, which is mentioned as a common cause of late post-operative endocarditis. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a type of staphylococci, which is mentioned as a common cause of early post-operative endocarditis. Streptococcus aureus is also a type of staphylococci, and is mentioned as a cause of early post-operative endocarditis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is not mentioned in the documents as a cause of post-operative endocarditis. Therefore, all of A, B, and C could be correct, but D is not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
