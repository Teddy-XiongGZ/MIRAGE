    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a condition that occurs most often in premature infants, and it is caused by the lack of a slippery substance called surfactant, which helps the lungs inflate with air and keeps them from collapsing. However, it can also occur in term infants. The documents suggest that RDS can be diagnosed based on clinical signs and radiological findings. An air bronchogram on a chest x-ray is a classic sign of RDS, as it indicates the presence of air-filled bronchi (the major air passages of the lungs) against a background of opaque (fluid-filled or collapsed) alveoli. Therefore, the presence of an air bronchogram on a chest x-ray would favor a diagnosis of RDS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
