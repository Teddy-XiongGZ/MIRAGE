    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the intraocular lens (IOL) implanted in young patients can remain stable and effective for a long period, even up to 10 years or more. There is no specific recommendation to remove or change the IOL after 10 years unless there are complications such as suture breakage, IOL dislocation, or other issues. Presbyopia is a condition that typically occurs in middle or old age, which is characterized by difficulty in reading or seeing at close distances. It is not directly related to the condition of the IOL and hence, the onset of presbyopia is not a reason to remove the IOL. Posterior Capsule ossification is a complication that can occur after IOL implantation, but it is not mentioned as a common issue in the documents. Therefore, it is not a routine reason to remove the IOL after 10 years.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Never be removed\"}"
