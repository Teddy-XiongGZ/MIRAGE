    "Based on the information provided in the documents, we can deduce the following: - Document [1] describes the functional classification of joints. It mentions that synarthrosis joints permit little or no mobility, amphiarthrosis joints permit slight mobility, and synovial joints (also known as diarthrosis) are freely movable. - Document [4] further explains that synovial joints allow for a range of movements such as abduction, adduction, extension, flexion, and rotation. - Document [11] also mentions that joints can be classified according to the number of axes of movement they allow, and diarthrosis (synovial joints) can have one, two, or three degrees of freedom, indicating a high degree of movement. From these documents, it is clear that diarthroses (synovial joints) allow for the greatest movement. So, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I looked at the functional classification of joints in Document [1], which indicated that diarthroses (synovial joints) are freely movable. This was further supported by Document [4] and Document [11], which described the range of movements and degrees of freedom allowed by synovial joints.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Diarthroses.\"}"
