    "Based on the documents provided, the mandibular first premolar has a dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual cusp (Document 12). The mandibular second premolar has a large buccal cusp and two smaller lingual cusps (Document 11). This suggests that the lingual surface of mandibular premolars is less developed compared to the buccal surface. On the other hand, the maxillary first premolar has two cusps that are sharp enough to resemble the prehensile teeth found in carnivorous animals (Document 29). The maxillary second premolar also has two cusps, but they are less sharp than those of the maxillary first premolars (Document 0). This suggests that both the buccal and lingual cusps of maxillary premolars are more developed and sharper compared to those of mandibular premolars. Therefore, the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars is that in the mandibular premolars, the lingual surface is rounded and less developed. The answer is: C. The lingual surface rounded and less developed The output in json format is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular first premolar has a dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual cusp.
