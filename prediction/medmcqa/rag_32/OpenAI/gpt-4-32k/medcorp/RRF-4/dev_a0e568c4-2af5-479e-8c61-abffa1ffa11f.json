    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The latent period of distraction osteogenesis is the time between the osteotomy and the beginning of the distraction. According to Document [7], the latency period might not be necessary in the distraction of the craniofacial skeleton in children. Document [10] also suggests that there were no differences in distraction with latency versus without latency. However, Document [25] mentions that after a latency period of 3 days, distraction was activated. Document [29] also mentions a latency period of 7 days before distraction was started. Therefore, the latent period can vary, but it is typically a few days.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 5-7 days\"}"
