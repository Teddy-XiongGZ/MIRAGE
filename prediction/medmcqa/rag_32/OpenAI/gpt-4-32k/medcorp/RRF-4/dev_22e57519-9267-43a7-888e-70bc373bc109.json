    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the test that should be done on corneal scrapings for a diagnosis of rabies. Negri bodies are usually found in brain tissue, not corneal scrapings, so option A is incorrect. Antibodies to rabies virus would be found in blood or cerebrospinal fluid, not corneal scrapings, so option B is incorrect. PCR for rabies virus could potentially be done on any tissue, including corneal scrapings, so option C is a possibility. Indirect immunofluorescence is a common method for detecting viral antigens in tissue samples, including corneal scrapings, so option D is also a possibility. However, according to Document [0], immunofluorescent antibody staining of the epithelial cells on the corneal impression test was positive for rabies. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
