    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rhodopsin is a light-sensitive receptor protein involved in visual phototransduction. It is found in the rods of the retina and is extremely sensitive to light, enabling vision in low-light conditions. When rhodopsin is exposed to light, it immediately photobleaches and is regenerated fully in about 30 minutes. Document [7] and Document [15] mention that without adequate amounts of retinol, a form of Vitamin A, regeneration of rhodopsin is incomplete and night blindness occurs. Therefore, rhodopsin deficiency is associated with Vitamin A deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Vitamin A deficiency\"}"
