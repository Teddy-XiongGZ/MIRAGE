    "Step 1: Review the options and identify the key points to search for in the documents. These are: the protein content of cow's milk, the carbohydrate content of cow's milk compared to mother's milk, and the potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) content of cow's milk compared to infant formula feeds. Step 2: Search the documents for information on the protein content of cow's milk. Document [5] mentions that cow's milk is a major source of high nutritional quality protein. However, it does not specify the percentage of whey protein and casein. Step 3: Search the documents for information on the carbohydrate content of cow's milk compared to mother's milk. Document [10] mentions that cow's milk has about 1.5 times the total carbohydrate of oat milk, but it does not compare cow's milk to mother's milk. Step 4: Search the documents for information on the potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) content of cow's milk compared to infant formula feeds. No document provides a direct comparison of these elements in cow's milk and infant formula feeds. Step 5: Based on the information found in the documents, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute any of the options. However, it is generally known that cow's milk contains about 20% whey protein and 80% casein, which contradicts option A. Based on this analysis, the answer is option A.
