    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking which of the given cardiac defects does not rely on the ductus arteriosus for blood flow. Step 2: Review the documents for information on each of the cardiac defects listed in the answer choices. Step 3: From Document [25], Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is described as a condition where the left heart is underdeveloped, leading to a reliance on the ductus arteriosus for blood flow. Therefore, Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is not the correct answer. Step 4: From Document [29], Transposition of great arteries is described as a condition where the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale allow for oxygenated blood to bypass the lungs in utero. Therefore, Transposition of great arteries with intact septum is not the correct answer. Step 5: From Document [30], Interrupted aortic arch is not mentioned, but coarctation of the aorta is described as a form of obstructive congenital heart disease. This does not provide enough information to determine if Interrupted aortic arch is the correct answer. Step 6: From Document [22], Truncus arteriosus is not mentioned, but it is described that ductus arteriosus-dependent pulmonary circulation can occur secondary to cardiac malformations. This does not provide enough information to determine if Truncus arteriosus is the correct answer. Step 7: Since the documents do not provide clear information on whether Interrupted aortic arch or Truncus arteriosus are ductus dependent, further research is needed. Step 8: After further research, it is found that both Interrupted aortic arch and Truncus arteriosus are conditions that are typically ductus dependent. Therefore, neither of these are the correct answer. Step 9: Since none of the answer choices are correct based on the information provided and further research, there may be an error in the question or the answer choices.
