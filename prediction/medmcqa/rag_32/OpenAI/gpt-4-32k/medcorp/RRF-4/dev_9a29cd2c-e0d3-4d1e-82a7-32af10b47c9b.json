    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Desmosomes are adhesive structures found in cells that experience high levels of mechanical stress. According to Document [11], desmosomes provide strength and resistance to mechanical stress by unloading forces onto the flexible but resilient intermediate filaments. This makes desmosomes important in tissues that encounter high levels of mechanical stress, such as heart muscle and epithelia, and explains why it appears frequently in these types of tissues. Therefore, the highest concentration of desmosomes would be seen in tissues that experience high levels of mechanical stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"This question is incomplete as the options A, B, C, D are not provided. Based on the information given, the answer would be in tissues that experience high levels of mechanical stress such as heart muscle and epithelia.\"}"
