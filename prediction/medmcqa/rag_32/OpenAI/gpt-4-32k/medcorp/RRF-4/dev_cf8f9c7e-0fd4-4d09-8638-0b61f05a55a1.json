    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that cerebral palsy is associated with orthopedic problems such as scoliosis. However, they do not specify a particular type of cerebral palsy that is more commonly associated with these issues. After reviewing the documents, it is clear that the severity of cerebral palsy, rather than the specific type, is more closely linked to the development of orthopedic problems. However, Document [13] mentions that hip dislocation and scoliosis are common in children with cerebral palsy, especially in the spastic and dyskinetic subtypes. Spastic quadriplegia is a subtype of cerebral palsy characterized by muscle stiffness or spasticity in all four limbs (both arms and both legs), as well as the torso and the face. This could potentially lead to orthopedic issues such as scoliosis. Therefore, the answer is likely to be Spastic quadriplegia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
