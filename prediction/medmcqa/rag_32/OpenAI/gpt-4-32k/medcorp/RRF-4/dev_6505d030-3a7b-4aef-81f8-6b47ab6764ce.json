From the documents, it is not explicitly mentioned that the tip of an ultrasonic scaler is cleaned under running H2O for 2 min (option A). Document [21] mentions chemical cleaning of dental units and power scalers, but it does not specify that this is the method used for cleaning the tip of an ultrasonic scaler after usage (option B).
