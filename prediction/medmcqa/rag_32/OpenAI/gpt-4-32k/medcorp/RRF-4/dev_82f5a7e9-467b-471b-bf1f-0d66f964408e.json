    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the L:S ratio, or lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio, is a common test for fetal lung maturity. However, it is also mentioned that in cases where the diabetic mother's metabolic control is not appropriate, the L:S ratio may give false positive results. Phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) presence in amniotic fluid of diabetic pregnant women confirms maturity with a very low risk to develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Therefore, the presence of phosphatidyl glycerol seems to be a more reliable indicator of fetal lung maturity in diabetic mothers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phosphatidyl glycerol\"}"
