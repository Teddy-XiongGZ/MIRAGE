    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the type of receptors that have the maximum number of genes coding for them in the mammalian genome. From the documents, Document [0] mentions that more than 40% of the 856 olfactory receptor genes in the human genome are located in 28 single-gene and multi-gene clusters along the chromosome. Document [3] also mentions that there are approximately 400 functional genes coding for olfactory receptors in humans. Document [28] mentions that the olfactory receptor (OR) family is one of the largest known mammalian gene families, with around 900 genes in human and 1500 in mouse. After discounting pseudogenes, the functional repertoire in mouse is more than three times larger than that of human. This information suggests that the maximum number of genes in the mammalian genome code for odorant receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Odorants\"}"
