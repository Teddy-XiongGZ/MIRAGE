    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a form of cell death that is regulated by dedicated genes, as mentioned in Document [4]. This rules out option D. Document [5] mentions that apoptosis is mediated by molecular pathways, which implies that the plasma membrane remains intact during the process, ruling out option B. Document [24] mentions that apoptosis is a process that does not cause inflammation, ruling out option A. This leaves us with option C, which states that apoptosis involves the swelling of organelles. This is not typically associated with apoptosis, which is usually characterized by cell shrinkage and not swelling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
