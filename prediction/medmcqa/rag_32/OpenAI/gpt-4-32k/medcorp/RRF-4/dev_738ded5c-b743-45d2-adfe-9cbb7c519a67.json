    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what a non-depolarising muscle relaxant is. From the documents, I learned that non-depolarising muscle relaxants are drugs that block neuromuscular transmission by acting as antagonists of the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. They do not depolarize the motor end plate. Now, I need to find which of the options is a short-acting non-depolarising muscle relaxant. Succinylcholine is a depolarising agent, so it can't be the answer. Pancuronium is a long-acting non-depolarising muscle relaxant, so it's not the answer either. Decamethonium is a depolarising muscle relaxant, so it's not the answer. Mivacurium, according to Document 29, is a non-depolarising drug with a short duration of action, so it fits the description.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
