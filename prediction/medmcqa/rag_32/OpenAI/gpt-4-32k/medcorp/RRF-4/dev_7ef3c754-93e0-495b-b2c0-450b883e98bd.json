    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When forces are applied on the lateral surface at an angle, the direction of the force will determine the area where compression is generated. If the force is applied downwards, it will cause compression on the inferior surface. If the force is applied upwards, it will cause compression on the superior surface. The question does not specify the direction of the force, but generally, forces applied on the lateral surface will cause compression on the opposite side, which is the medial surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
