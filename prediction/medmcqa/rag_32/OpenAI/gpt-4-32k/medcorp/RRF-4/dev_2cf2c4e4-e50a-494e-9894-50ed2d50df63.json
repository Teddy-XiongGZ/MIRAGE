    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The strength of association between a risk factor and a disease is typically measured using statistical methods that provide a ratio or comparison between groups with and without the risk factor. Attributable risk is a measure of the proportion of disease incidence that can be attributed to a specific exposure, but it does not directly measure the strength of association. Absolute risk of the variable is the probability that an individual will develop a disease over a certain period of time, but it does not measure the strength of association between a risk factor and a disease. P-value is a statistical measure that helps scientists determine whether their hypotheses are correct, but it does not measure the strength of association. Odds ratio and relative risk are both measures of effect size, describing the strength of association or non-independence between two binary data values. Therefore, the correct answer is Odds ratio/Relative risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
