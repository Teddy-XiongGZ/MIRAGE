    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the removal of an impacted tooth requires a thorough understanding of its position, inclination, and relationship with adjacent structures. This information is crucial for planning the surgical intervention. Document [1] and Document [2] suggest that radiographs provide this information. However, a single type of radiograph may not be sufficient. Document [10] and Document [18] suggest that 3D radiographic techniques like CBCT can provide a more comprehensive view of the impacted tooth and its surroundings. Therefore, a single periapical film (Choice A), a bite-wing film (Choice B), a lateral view (Choice C), or an anteroposterior view (Choice D) may not be sufficient on their own.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
