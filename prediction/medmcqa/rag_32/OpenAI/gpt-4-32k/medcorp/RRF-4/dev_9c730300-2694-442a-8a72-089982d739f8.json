    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best way to assess the tissue response to oral hygiene instruction. Probing the base of the socket (A) is not directly related to oral hygiene instruction. Reduced tooth mobility (D) is more related to periodontal treatment rather than oral hygiene instruction. Between changes in plaque scores (B) and reduced tendency to bleed on probing the gingival margin (C), both are good indicators of the effectiveness of oral hygiene instruction. However, bleeding on probing is a more direct indicator of gingival health and inflammation, which is a key aspect of oral hygiene. Therefore, reduced tendency to bleed on probing the gingival margin would be the best way to assess tissue response to oral hygiene instruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
