    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to consider the age of the patient, which is 8 years old. At this age, the patient is likely still in the mixed dentition stage, meaning they have a mix of primary (baby) and permanent teeth. According to Document [2], the best age to begin orthodontic treatment depends on the type of malocclusion. However, the document does not specify the best age for each type of malocclusion. Document [11] suggests that opportunities for preventive orthodontic treatment arise during all stages of oral growth and development, which includes the mixed dentition stage. However, the document does not specify what type of treatment should be used. Document [5] discusses the early treatment of Class III malocclusion, but the question does not specify the class of malocclusion. Document [22] and [26] suggest that a thorough evaluation by an orthodontist is necessary to determine the cause of malocclusion and develop a treatment plan. Given the patient's age and the lack of specific information about the type and severity of the malocclusion, it seems that a wait and watch approach may be appropriate until more permanent teeth have erupted and a more definitive treatment plan can be developed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
