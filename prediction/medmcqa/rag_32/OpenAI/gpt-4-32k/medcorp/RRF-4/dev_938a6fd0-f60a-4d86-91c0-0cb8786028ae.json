    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the placement of retention points in class III composite preparation. Document [7] states that 'Classically, Class III composite preparations were required to have retention points placed entirely in dentin.' However, it also mentions that 'Modern techniques vary, but conventional wisdom states that because there have been great increases in bonding strength due to the use of dentin primers in the late 1990s, physical retention is not needed except for the most extreme of cases.' This suggests that the placement of retention points has evolved over time and is not strictly required in all cases. However, based on the historical practice and the options provided, the answer would be that retention points were traditionally placed entirely in dentin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Entirely in dentine\"}"
