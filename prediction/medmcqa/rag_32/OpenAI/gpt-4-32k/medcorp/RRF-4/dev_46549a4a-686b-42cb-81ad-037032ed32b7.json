    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what high Cu alloys are. From the documents, I can see that high Cu alloys are alloys with a high copper content. Document [0] mentions that high Cu alloys have strong antibacterial properties. Document [1] mentions that high Cu alloys have high tensile strength and yield strength. Document [14] mentions that high Cu alloys have low creep. However, I did not find any information suggesting that high Cu alloys have high corrosion. Therefore, the statement that high Cu alloys have high corrosion is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
