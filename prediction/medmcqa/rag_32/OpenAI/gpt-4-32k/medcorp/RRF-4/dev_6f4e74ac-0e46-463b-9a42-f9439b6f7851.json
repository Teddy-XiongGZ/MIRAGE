    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an excess of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood. PTH has several effects on the body, including its action on the kidneys. It inhibits the reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney tubules, leading to an increase in phosphate excretion in the urine. Therefore, the decreased phosphate levels seen in hyperparathyroidism are due to increased loss of phosphate in urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased loss of phosphate in urine\"}"
