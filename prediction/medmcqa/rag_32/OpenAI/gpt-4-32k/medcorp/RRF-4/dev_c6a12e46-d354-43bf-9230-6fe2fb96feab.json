    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Local anesthetics work by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses. The onset of action of local anesthetics is influenced by several factors, including the size of the nerve fibers. According to Document [9], smaller fibers have smaller internodal distances and, therefore, get blocked by local anesthetics more quickly. This is due to the high ratio of surface area to the volume of small nerve fibers, which allows the anesthetic to diffuse more quickly and block the nerve impulse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
