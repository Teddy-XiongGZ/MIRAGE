    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a painless mass in the left scrotal sac and microscopic hematuria. Epididymitis usually presents with pain, so it can be ruled out. Renal cell carcinoma could cause hematuria, but it wouldn't cause a scrotal mass. Carcinoma lung could metastasize to the scrotum, but it's less likely. Seminoma, a type of testicular cancer, commonly presents as a painless scrotal mass and could cause microscopic hematuria. The negative Alphafetoprotein and lactate dehydrogenase are also consistent with seminoma, as these markers are often normal in this type of cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
