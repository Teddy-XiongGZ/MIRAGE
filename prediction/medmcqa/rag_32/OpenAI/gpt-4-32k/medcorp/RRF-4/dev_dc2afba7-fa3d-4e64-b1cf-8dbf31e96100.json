    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the appropriate action for a 10-year-old boy who has been bitten by a dog. The bite was unprovoked. The documents provided do not give specific information about the protocol for handling dog bites in terms of vaccination or observation of the dog. However, it is generally accepted in medical practice that after a dog bite, especially an unprovoked one, the victim should receive a rabies vaccine if they haven't been previously vaccinated, as the disease can be fatal and the vaccination status of the dog is unknown. Observing the dog for signs of rabies is also a common practice. Killing the dog and sending its brain for biopsy is an extreme measure that is usually not necessary unless the dog shows signs of rabies and there is a high risk of transmission. Doing nothing is not an appropriate action as it leaves the boy at risk of developing a rabies infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
