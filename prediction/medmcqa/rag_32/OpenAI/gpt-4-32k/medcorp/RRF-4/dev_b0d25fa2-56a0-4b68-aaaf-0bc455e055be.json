    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The standard error of a statistic is the standard deviation of the set of means that would be found by drawing an infinite number of repeated samples from the population and computing a mean for each sample. The mean's standard error turns out to equal the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, and is estimated by using the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. In this case, the standard deviation is 1 and the sample size is 100. Therefore, the standard error would be 1 divided by the square root of 100.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
