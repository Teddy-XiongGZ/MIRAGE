    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, Ni-Ti spreaders have more flexibility than stainless-steel spreaders (Document 4). Ni-Ti spreaders also generate less stress during condensation (Document 11). Ni-Ti spreaders have less incidence of root fracture (Document 5). However, Ni-Ti spreaders do not achieve less depth penetration than stainless-steel spreaders. In fact, they penetrate deeper (Document 0, Document 15).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
