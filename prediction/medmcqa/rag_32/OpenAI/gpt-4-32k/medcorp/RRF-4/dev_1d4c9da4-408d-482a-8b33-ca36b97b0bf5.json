    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dimensional stability of elastomeric impression materials is a crucial factor in dental procedures. According to Document 10, Addition silicones and condensation silicones have better ability to recover from induced deformation when compared to polyether. Document 13 also confirms the superiority of the addition silicone compared to the condensation silicone and polyether. Document 18 also states that VPS (Vinyl Polysiloxane, a type of addition silicone) was found to be the most stable impression material concerning dimensional change and wettability. Therefore, the order of dimensional stability should be Addition silicone > Condensation silicone > Polyether > Polysulphide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Addition silicone > Condensation silicone Polysulphide > Polyether\"}"
