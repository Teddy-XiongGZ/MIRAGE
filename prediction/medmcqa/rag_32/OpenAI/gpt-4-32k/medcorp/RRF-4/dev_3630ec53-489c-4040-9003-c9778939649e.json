    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi apparatus, also known as Golgi bodies, is an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. It is involved in the packaging and dispatch of protein products received from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These proteins are modified and destined for secretion via exocytosis or for use in the cell. The Golgi apparatus is also involved in lipid transport and lysosome formation. It is of particular importance in processing proteins for secretion, containing a set of glycosylation enzymes that attach various sugar monomers to proteins as the proteins move through the apparatus. Therefore, the Golgi bodies function in the sorting of glycoproteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
