    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the statement that is not true about fresh frozen plasma. Step 2: Review each choice in relation to the documents provided. Choice A: Document [3] states that fresh frozen plasma contains all coagulation factors except platelets. This means that it does supply major coagulation factors, so this statement is true. Choice B: Document [4] states that fresh frozen plasma must be ABO compatible with the recipient\u2019s red cells. This means that an ABO match is required, so this statement is not true. Choice C: Document [15] and [10] state that fresh frozen plasma is indicated for the deficiency of coagulation factors with abnormal coagulation tests in the presence of active bleeding, which can occur in conditions like DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) and trauma. This means that it should be used in replacement of factors in DIC/Trauma, so this statement is true. Choice D: Document [4] states that fresh frozen plasma should be administered immediately after thawing, but it does not specify that it should be used within 30 minutes of having trauma. However, the use of fresh frozen plasma in trauma situations is indicated, so this statement is likely true. Step 3: Based on the review of the choices, the statement that is not true about fresh frozen plasma is Choice B.
