    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic neuron is triggered by the influx of calcium ions through specific presynaptic calcium channels, as stated in Document [2]. Therefore, blocking these calcium channels would likely decrease, not increase, ACh release. On the other hand, Document [4] mentions that opening a potassium ion channel in the presynaptic membrane will cause the neuron to become more negatively charged, which could potentially decrease the release of neurotransmitters. Therefore, blocking potassium channels might increase ACh release. There is no information in the documents provided that suggests blocking sodium or chloride channels would increase ACh release.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
