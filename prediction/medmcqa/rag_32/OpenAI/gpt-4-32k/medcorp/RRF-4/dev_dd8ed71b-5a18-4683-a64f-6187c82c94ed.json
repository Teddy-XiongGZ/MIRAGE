    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space. In this case, the event is the admission of head injury patients in a trauma care centre. The other distributions do not fit this scenario as well. The normal distribution is used for continuous data, which is not the case here. The binomial distribution is used for binary outcomes, which also does not apply here. The uniform distribution implies that all outcomes are equally likely, which is unlikely in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Poisson distribution\"}"
