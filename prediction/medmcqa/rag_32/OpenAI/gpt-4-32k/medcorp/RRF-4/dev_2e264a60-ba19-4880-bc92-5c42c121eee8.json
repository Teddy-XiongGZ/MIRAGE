    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the impact of extracting the 3rd molar tooth bud in a 7-9 year old child. Document [6] discusses the removal of third molar germs as an alternative to extractions of premolars in cases of crowding in the mandibular arch. Document [18] suggests that dental practitioners should wait until the age of 10, 11, and even 12 to extract the first molars, when the furcation is formed. Document [23] suggests that extraction of the lower first permanent molar encouraged mesial movement and uprighting of the developing third molar, which may improve the likelihood of future eruption of the third molar. However, none of these documents directly answer the question. Document [13] suggests that third molar is absent in 32.4% of the population and 7.4% of the molars presented early formation stage malposition. Therefore, oligodontia diagnosis and third molar malposition cannot be done before 13 years of age. This suggests that extraction of the 3rd molar tooth bud in a 7-9 year old child may not be advisable. However, Document [18] suggests that extraction of the lower first permanent molar encouraged mesial movement and uprighting of the developing third molar, which may improve the likelihood of future eruption of the third molar. This suggests that extraction of the 3rd molar tooth bud in a 7-9 year old child could potentially result in less crowding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
