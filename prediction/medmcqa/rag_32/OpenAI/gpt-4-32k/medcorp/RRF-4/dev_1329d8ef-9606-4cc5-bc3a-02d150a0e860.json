    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The occlusal clearance of an onlay refers to the space needed for the onlay to fit properly on the tooth without interfering with the opposing tooth. Depth cuts are used to ensure a consistent reduction of tooth structure during preparation, but they do not directly detect occlusal clearance. Visual inspection can give a general idea of the occlusal clearance but it may not be accurate. Wax chew-in is not typically used in the context of onlays. Articulating paper, on the other hand, is commonly used in dentistry to check occlusion and can help detect high spots and interferences, including inadequate occlusal clearance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
