    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mannitol, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and apraclonidine are all known to decrease intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. Mannitol is a hyperosmotic agent that reduces IOP by decreasing the volume of the vitreous humor (Document 22). Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, reduce IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous humor (Document 22). Apraclonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that reduces IOP by decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow (Document 25). On the other hand, Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is known to increase IOP in some patients, especially those with a predisposition to glaucoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
