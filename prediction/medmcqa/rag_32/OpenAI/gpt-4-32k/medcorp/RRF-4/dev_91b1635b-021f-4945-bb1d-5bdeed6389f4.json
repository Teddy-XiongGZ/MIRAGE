    "Based on the information provided in the documents, a left-skewed curve, also known as negatively skewed, is characterized by a long tail on the left side of the distribution. This means that the majority of the data points fall to the right of the mean, and the tail of the distribution skews towards the left. Therefore, in a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the mode. Step-by-step thinking: 1. Review the documents to understand the characteristics of a left-skewed curve. 2. Identify that in a left-skewed curve, the tail is on the left side of the distribution, indicating that the majority of data points are to the right of the mean. 3. Conclude that in a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the mode. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Mean < Mode.
