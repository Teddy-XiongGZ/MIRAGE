    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has already received a full rabies vaccination in December 2018. According to the revised Dutch guidelines mentioned in Document 28, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) no longer consists of five vaccines for unvaccinated individuals; instead it is four vaccines on days 0, 3, 7, and 14-28. However, this is for unvaccinated individuals. For those who have been vaccinated, the protocol might be different. The pet also had a vaccination, which reduces the risk of it carrying the rabies virus. Therefore, the child might not need the full course of vaccines or rabies immunoglobulin. The best course of action would be to administer 2 doses of vaccine on day 0 and 3 as a precautionary measure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
