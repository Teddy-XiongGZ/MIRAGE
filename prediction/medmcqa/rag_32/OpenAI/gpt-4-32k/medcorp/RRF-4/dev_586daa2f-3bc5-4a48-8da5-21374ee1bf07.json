    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the order of caries susceptibility in primary teeth. Document [1] provides information about the susceptibility of different tooth surfaces to caries. It mentions that the most susceptible group consists of the buccal pits and occlusal fissured surfaces of the first molar teeth. The second group consisted of 12 sites on the second molar and premolar teeth. The group formed by the least susceptible sites included the largest number of tooth surfaces and consists of the majority of the lower anterior teeth and canines. This suggests that the first molar is the most susceptible, followed by the second molar, and then the canine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 1st molar>2st molar>canine\"}"
