    "The Levator Ani is a broad, thin muscle group, situated on either side of the pelvis. It is formed from three muscle components: the pubococcygeus, the iliococcygeus, and the puborectalis (Document [26]). It supports the viscera in the pelvic cavity, and surrounds the various structures that pass through it (Document [26]). The levator ani muscles are mostly innervated by the pudendal nerve, perineal nerve and acting together (Document [22]). The levator ani muscle is attached to the inner surface of each side of the lesser pelvis (Document [26]). However, there is no mention in the documents that the Levator Ani is attached to the pelvic brim. So, the output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Levator Ani is a broad, thin muscle group, situated on either side of the pelvis.
