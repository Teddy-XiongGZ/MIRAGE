    "The first step is to understand what the question is asking. It is asking about the cause of the initial clicking sound in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during opening. Next, I will review the documents to find relevant information. Document [0] states that \"Clicking was a consistent finding of anterior disc displacement with reduction\". This suggests that the clicking sound is associated with the displacement of the disc in the joint. Document [4] also mentions that \"clicking indicating anterior disc displacement with reduction\". This further supports the idea that the clicking sound is associated with the displacement of the disc. Document [10] explains that \"The noise indicates that the articular disc has suddenly moved to and from a temporarily displaced position (disk displacement with reduction) to allow completion of a phase of movement of the mandible.\" This suggests that the clicking sound is due to the movement of the disc in the joint. Based on this information, the clicking sound is associated with the displacement of the disc in the joint. Looking at the answer choices, the one that best fits this description is choice B, \"Retruded condyle in respect to articular disc\". This choice suggests that the condyle, a part of the joint, is positioned behind the disc, which could cause the disc to be displaced when the joint is opened. So, the final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of the initial clicking sound in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during opening.
