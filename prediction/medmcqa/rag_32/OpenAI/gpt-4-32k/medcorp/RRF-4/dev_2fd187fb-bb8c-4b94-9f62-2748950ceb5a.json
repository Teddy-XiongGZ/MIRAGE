    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiopental is a short-acting barbiturate general anesthetic. According to Document [0], the action of a single dose of thiopental is terminated within a few minutes by redistribution of the drug from the brain to peripheral tissues. This suggests that the short duration of anesthetic action of a single dose of thiopental is due to its ability to rapidly leave the brain tissue. Document [5] also supports this, stating that the very short action of thiopental after a single injection is due to the rapid redistribution of the agent into the muscle mass. Therefore, the answer is D. Ability to enter and leave brain tissue very rapidly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
