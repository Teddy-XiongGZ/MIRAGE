    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pulpal floor is the internal base of a cavity preparation, closest to the pulp chamber of the tooth. Deepening the pulpal floor during cavity preparation does not provide for outline form, which refers to the design of the cavity to remove all caries and defects. It also does not provide for retention form, which refers to the shape or form of the prepared cavity that prevents displacement or removal of the restoration. Convenience form refers to the shape or form of the prepared cavity that provides for adequate observation, accessibility, and ease of operation in preparing and restoring the cavity. Deepening the pulpal floor can provide convenience form by allowing easier access and visibility during the procedure. Resistance form refers to the shape and placement of the cavity walls in such a way as to best enable the restoration and remaining tooth structure to withstand masticatory forces without fracture. By deepening the pulpal floor, the dentist can create a cavity preparation that better resists the forces of mastication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. convenience form\"}"
