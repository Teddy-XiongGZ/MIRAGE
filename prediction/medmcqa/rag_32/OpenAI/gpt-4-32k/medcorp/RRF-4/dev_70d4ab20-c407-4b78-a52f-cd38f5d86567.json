    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute pulpitis is characterized by pain, and the pulp contains nerves, so option A is incorrect. There is no information in the documents about the number of proprioceptors in the pulp, so option B cannot be confirmed. The ability of a patient to speak or their cooperativeness does not directly affect their ability to locate pain, so options C and D are not relevant.

This could be the reason why it is difficult for a patient with acute pulpitis to locate the pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"E. The pain is referred\"}"
