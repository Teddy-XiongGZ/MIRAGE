    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the potential generated due to the movement of freely diffusible ions across a semi-permeable membrane. From the documents, it is clear that the Nernst equation is used to calculate the potential of an ion across a membrane when the membrane is in thermodynamic equilibrium and the cell is permeable to only one ion (Document 17). However, the question is about freely diffusible ions, which implies multiple ions. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation is used to calculate the membrane potential when a cell has significant permeabilities to more than one ion (Document 6). Therefore, the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
