    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the management of a patient with stage T1a gallbladder cancer that was incidentally discovered after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. According to Document [0], patients with IGBC having Tis and T1a stage, with negative cystic duct margin can be treated by simple cholecystectomy alone. Document [2] also supports this, stating that early GBC (T1a or T1s) can successfully be managed by simple cholecystectomy. Document [3] also suggests that gallbladder carcinoma may be curable if diagnosed as IGBC at an early stage. Document [6] also supports that simple cholecystectomy offers adequate treatment for T1a cancers. Document [21] also suggests that simple LC is appropriate for T1a patients with clear margin and unbroken gallbladder. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient would be simple cholecystectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
