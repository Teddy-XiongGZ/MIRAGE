    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Strain is the deformation experienced by a body in the direction of force applied, divided by initial dimensions of the body. The following are the different types of strain when a force is applied: 1. Tensile strain: a type of strain caused due to enough stress that tries to pull a material apart. 2. Compressive strain: this type of strain occurs when a material shortens or compresses in response to stress. 3. Shear strain: this strain occurs when a material deforms due to forces acting tangent to the surface or in parallel to the surface. When a force is applied perpendicular to the surface, it either compresses or extends the material. If the material is compressed, it is called compressive strain. If it is extended, it is called tensile strain. Therefore, when a force is applied perpendicular to the surface, it can cause either compressive or tensile strain, depending on whether the material is compressed or extended.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Compressive strain, B. Tensile strain\"}"
