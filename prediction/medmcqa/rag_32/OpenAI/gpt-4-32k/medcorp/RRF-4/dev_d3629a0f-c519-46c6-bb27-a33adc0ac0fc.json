    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the additional time required for enamel calcification after a tooth has erupted into the oral cavity. Document [16] mentions that the tertiary maturation of the erupting tooth needs much more time than it is supposed in literature and that the completion is in accord with the decline of the caries activity at the end of the second decade of lifetime. It also mentions that the mineralization level in the outer surface of human enamel is completing little by little in more than 5 years after eruption. This suggests that the process of enamel calcification continues for several years after the tooth has erupted. However, it does not provide a specific time frame within the given options. Therefore, the closest answer would be 4 years (option D), as it is the longest period provided in the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
