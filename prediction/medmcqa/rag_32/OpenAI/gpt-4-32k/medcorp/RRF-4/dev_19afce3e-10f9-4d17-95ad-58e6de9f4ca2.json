    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about the patterns of accessory canals in mandibular molars. Document [0] mentions that different morphologic types of accessory canals were found in the furcation area of submerged mandibular molars. However, it does not specify the number of patterns. Document [1] does not provide information about the patterns of accessory canals. Document [2] discusses accessory canals in primary molars, not mandibular molars. Document [3] talks about the apical anatomy of C-shaped root canal systems in mandibular second molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [4] discusses the root canal configuration and the prevalence of C-shaped canals in mandibular second molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [5] discusses the location and incidence of accessory pulpal canals in periodontal pockets, which is not relevant to the question. Document [6] discusses the detection and negotiation of accessory mesial canals in mandibular molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [7] discusses the root canal configuration, foramina, and accessory canals frequency of mandibular first molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [8] discusses the structure, distribution and formation of accessory canals in the developing and mature molar teeth of rat mandibular jaws, which is not relevant to the question. Document [9] discusses the anatomy of mandibular first molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [10] discusses multiple mandibular canals of the bifid variety, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [11] discusses accessory roots in maxillary molar teeth, which is not relevant to the question. Document [12] discusses the root and canal anatomy of mandibular first and second molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [13] discusses the anatomic characteristics of the accessory mental foramina and accessory branches of the mandibular canal, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [14] discusses the symmetry of root and root canal morphology of maxillary and mandibular first molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [15] discusses the prevalence of C-shaped canals in mandibular second molars in a Lebanese population, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [16] discusses the frequency of the middle mesial canal in mandibular first molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [17] discusses the incidence and variability features of root canals system (RCS) and their ramifications, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [18] discusses the frequency, location, and direction of the lateral, secondary, and accessory canals, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [19] discusses the presence, location and the number of accessory or nutrient canals in the body of the mandible, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [20] discusses the root canal morphology of permanent maxillary and mandibular canines, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [21] discusses the incidence and variability features of root canals system (RCS) and their ramifications, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [22] discusses the root form and canal morphology of mandibular first molar teeth, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [23] discusses mandibular molars with five canals, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [24] discusses the anatomical features of C-shaped canal systems in Chinese mandibular second molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [25] discusses the presence and the characteristics of mandibular accessory canals, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [26] discusses the root canal morphology of the mandibular second molar, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [27] discusses the root canal anatomy of single-rooted permanent maxillary and mandibular canines, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [28] discusses the anatomical features of C-shaped canal systems in Chinese mandibular second molars, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [29] discusses the presence, location and the number of accessory or nutrient canals in the body of the mandible, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [30] discusses the root canal morphology of permanent maxillary and mandibular canines, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Document [31] discusses the incidence and characteristics of mandibular accessory canals, but it does not mention the patterns of accessory canals. Therefore, none of the documents provide a clear answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
