    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ganglionic transmission refers to the process of transmitting signals from the central nervous system to the peripheral nervous system via autonomic ganglia. This process involves the release of neurotransmitters from the preganglionic nerve terminal, which then bind to receptors on the postganglionic neuron. According to Document [0], the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse between the preganglionic nerve terminal and the principal ganglion neuron is a key part of this process. Document [4] further specifies that the ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine receptor mediates fast synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Acetylcholine receptors are a type of nicotinic receptor, which suggests that postsynaptic nicotinic receptors mediate ganglionic transmission.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
