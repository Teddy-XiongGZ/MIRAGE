    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biofilm formation in bacteria is a mechanism that contributes to antimicrobial resistance. According to the documents, biofilms can act as a mechanical barrier, preventing antibiotics from reaching the bacteria (Document 25). They can also alter the metabolism of the bacteria, making them less susceptible to the effects of antibiotics (Document 14). Biofilms also enhance the adherence of bacteria to surfaces, making it harder to remove them (Document 25). However, there is no mention in the documents of biofilms increasing the excretion of antibiotics as a mechanism of resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
