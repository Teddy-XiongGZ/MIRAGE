    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a type of flow where a material turns to liquid when a critical shear stress is applied. From the documents, it is clear that Bingham body behaviour is described as a material behaving as a solid at low stresses but flows as a viscous fluid at high stresses. This seems to match the description in the question. Newtonian body, on the other hand, is a type of fluid that has a constant viscosity, meaning it flows the same way regardless of the stress applied. Dilatant and Pseudoplastic are types of non-Newtonian fluids, but they do not specifically describe the behaviour of turning to liquid when a critical shear stress is applied.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
