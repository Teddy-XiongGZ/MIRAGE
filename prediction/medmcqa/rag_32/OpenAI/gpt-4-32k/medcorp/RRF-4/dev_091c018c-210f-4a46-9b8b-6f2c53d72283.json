    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Benign intracranial hypertension, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without a detectable cause. The main symptoms include headache and vision problems, which can include papilledema, a swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure. This is mentioned in Document [0], Document [1], Document [13], and Document [31]. Normal size ventricles are also a feature of benign intracranial hypertension, as stated in Document [11]. However, proptosis, or bulging eyes, is not typically associated with benign intracranial hypertension. It is more commonly seen in conditions like Graves' disease. None of the provided documents mention proptosis as a symptom of benign intracranial hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
