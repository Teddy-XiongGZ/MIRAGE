Document [23] suggests that for high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), early surgical intervention is recommended. Document [9] also suggests that for grades IV and V reflux, surgery should be the treatment of choice. Document [20] also supports the idea that surgery should be the first-line treatment for grade V vesicoureteral reflux. Document [28] also suggests that early correction of vesicoureteral reflux may provide protection from reflux associated renal damage and prolonged antibiotic use. Therefore, the best treatment option for this case would be surgical intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ureteric reimplantation\"}"
