    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, it is clear that both epinephrine and norepinephrine have effects on the heart, including increasing heart rate and contractility. However, the question is asking about a hormone that increases the sensitivity of the heart to epinephrine. Document [12] mentions that thyroid hormones increase the heart rate and can impact the beta adrenergic response similar to epinephrine and norepinephrine. This suggests that thyroid hormones could potentially increase the sensitivity of the heart to epinephrine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Thyroid\"}"
