    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the administration of fluoride to a 4-year-old child who already has 0.2 ppm fluoride in drinking water. According to the documents, all children should receive some form of systemic fluoride and appropriate forms of topical fluoride. If a child is not receiving optimally fluoridated water, the physician or dentist should prescribe a dietary fluoride supplement as tablets or drops. The correct dosage must be determined based on patient age and fluoride content of the patient's drinking water. In this case, the child is already receiving 0.2 ppm fluoride from drinking water, which is below the optimal level. Therefore, the child can be administered additional fluoride. However, the form of fluoride administration should be appropriate for the child's age. A 1 mg tablet per day might be too much for a 4-year-old child. Rinses are usually not recommended for children under 6 years old due to the risk of swallowing. Topical application of fluoride could be an option, but it's usually done in a dental office. Fluoride-containing dentifrices are commonly used for children and can provide the additional fluoride needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Fluoride containing dentifrices\"}"
