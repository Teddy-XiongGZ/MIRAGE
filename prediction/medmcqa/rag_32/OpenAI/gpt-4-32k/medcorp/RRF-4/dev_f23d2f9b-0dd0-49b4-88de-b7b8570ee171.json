    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that is crucial for maintaining the balance of cell populations. When this process is disrupted, it can lead to various diseases. Document [12] mentions that hyperactive apoptosis can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, which means that these diseases are associated with increased, not decreased, apoptosis. Document [16] mentions that defects in apoptosis can lead to autoimmune disorders, which means these disorders are associated with decreased apoptosis and increased cell survival. Document [0] and [1] do not mention myocardial infarction or stroke in relation to apoptosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Auto immune disorders\"}"
