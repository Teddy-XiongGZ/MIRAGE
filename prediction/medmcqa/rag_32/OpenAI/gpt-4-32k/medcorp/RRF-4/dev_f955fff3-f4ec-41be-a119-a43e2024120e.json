    "First, let's break down the options: A. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibre secretomotor: According to Document [5], the parotid gland receives its parasympathetic input from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via the otic ganglion. This suggests that the parasympathetic fibers are indeed secretomotor, as they control the secretion of saliva. B. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibre relay in Otic ganglion: Document [5] also supports this statement, as it mentions that the parotid gland receives its parasympathetic input from the glossopharyngeal nerve via the otic ganglion. C. Preganglionic parasympathetic nerve begin in inferior petrosal nucleus: Document [16] states that the preganglionic nerve fibers originate in the inferior salivatory nucleus of the rostral medulla, not the inferior petrosal nucleus. D. Sympathetic nerve are vasomotor: Document [5] mentions that salivary glands, including the parotid gland, are innervated by the sympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is known to control the diameter of blood vessels, which is a vasomotor function. Based on this analysis, the false statement about the innervation of the parotid gland is option C. So, the final output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first looked at each option and compared it with the information in the documents. Options A, B, and D are supported by the documents, but option C is contradicted by Document [16], which states that the preganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers originate in the inferior salivatory nucleus, not the inferior petrosal nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
