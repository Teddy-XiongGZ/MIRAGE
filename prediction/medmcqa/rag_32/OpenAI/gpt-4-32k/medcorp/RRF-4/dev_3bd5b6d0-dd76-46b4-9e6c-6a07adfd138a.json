    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fear developed due to previous experiences, events, or objects is not innate, as it is not present from birth but rather acquired through life experiences. It is also not objective, as it is not based on observable phenomena but rather personal experiences and perceptions. The term 'subjective fear' seems to be the most appropriate, as it refers to fear that is based on an individual's personal experiences and perceptions. However, this term is not commonly used in the medical literature. The documents provided do not mention 'subjective fear' as a term. Therefore, none of the options A, B, or C accurately describe fear developed due to previous experiences, events, or objects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
