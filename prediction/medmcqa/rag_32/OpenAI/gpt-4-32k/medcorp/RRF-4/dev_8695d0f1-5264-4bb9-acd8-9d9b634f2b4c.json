According to the documents, the management of button batteries located in the stomach is still controversial. Some documents suggest that if the battery is located in the stomach or beyond and the patient is asymptomatic, a conservative approach can be followed. However, other documents suggest that even if the battery is located in the stomach, it may cause damage early and extraction should be considered before 48 hours. Therefore, the decision to remove the battery endoscopically should be based on the patient's symptoms, the type and size of the battery, and the time since ingestion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
