    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common systemic symptom during the migration of larval phase of certain helminths. Document [17] mentions that during the acute stage of Strongyloides infection, individuals may have a pruritic edematous petechial rash. Document [30] states that pulmonary eosinophilia occurs in almost all metazoan infections and that most of the nematodes cause pulmonary eosinophilia during larval migration through the lungs. This suggests that the most common systemic symptom during the migration of larval phase of these helminths is likely related to the lungs. Looking at the answer choices, the one that fits this description is pneumonitis, which is inflammation of the lungs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
