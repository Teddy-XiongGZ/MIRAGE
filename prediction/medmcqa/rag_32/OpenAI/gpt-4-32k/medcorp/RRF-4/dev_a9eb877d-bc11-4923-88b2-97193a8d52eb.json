    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which milestone, if not achieved by a 3-year-old child, would be considered a developmental delay. According to the documents, developmental milestones are age-specific skills or behaviors that most children can do by a certain age range. The absence of these skills at the expected age might indicate a developmental delay. Document [3] states that milestones are defined by the age at which 90-95% of all children in a specific population pass a particular milestone. Therefore, we need to identify which of the given options is typically achieved by most children by the age of 3. Hopping on one leg and drawing a square are more complex skills that might not be expected of a 3-year-old. On the other hand, feeding by spoon and catching a ball reliably are simpler skills that are typically developed by this age. Therefore, if a 3-year-old child is unable to feed themselves with a spoon or catch a ball reliably, this could be considered a developmental delay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Feeding by spoon\"}"
