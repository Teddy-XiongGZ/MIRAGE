    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is characterized by the formation of vegetations along the cusps of the heart valves, as mentioned in Document [1]. These vegetations can lead to complications such as myocardial abscess, as suggested in Document [23]. However, the formation of a thrombus in the left atria is not typically associated with infective endocarditis. Instead, thrombi are more commonly associated with conditions such as atrial fibrillation. Similarly, perforation of a cusp is not a typical feature of infective endocarditis, but rather a potential complication of severe valve disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Thrombus in left atria.\"}"
