    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sudden death in a patient with an acute myocardial infarction is most commonly due to a cardiac event. Aortic dissection and cardiac tamponade are serious conditions but they are not the most common causes of sudden death in these patients. Atrial fibrillation can be serious but it's not typically fatal. Ventricular fibrillation, on the other hand, is a severe heart rhythm disturbance that can lead to sudden cardiac death. This is supported by multiple documents, such as Document [2], Document [4], Document [5], Document [10], Document [13], Document [17], Document [23], Document [25], Document [27], and Document [29].\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
