    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about nitric oxide's role in regulating vasomotor tone. Document [17] mentions that nitric oxide is a vasodilator, which implies it regulates vasomotor tone. So, option A is true. Step 2: Look for information about nitric oxide acting via cAMP. Document [1] and [21] mention that nitric oxide mediates its biological effects by activating guanylyl cyclase and increasing cyclic GMP synthesis, not cAMP. So, option B is false. Step 3: Search for information about nitric oxide being present in cigarette smoke. This information is not explicitly mentioned in the documents, but it is a known fact in the medical field that nitric oxide is a component of cigarette smoke. So, option C is true. Step 4: Look for information about nitric oxide's role in penile erection. Document [29] mentions the use of medications such as sildenafil, which are known to work by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, and are used to treat erectile dysfunction. So, option D is true. Based on these steps, the false statement about nitric oxide is that it acts via cAMP.
