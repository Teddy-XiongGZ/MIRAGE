    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [27] states that heavy force combined with corticotomy produced more periodontal ligament hyalinization and root resorption than the light force combined with corticotomy. Document [29] also mentions that osteoclast formation and bone resorption caused by loading forces on the periodontal ligament depend on TNF-\u03b1. This suggests that heavy forces on the periodontal ligament can cause hyalinization and osteoclastic activity, leading to bone resorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A, B, D\"}"
