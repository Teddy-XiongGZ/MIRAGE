    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ECG findings of a short PR interval and delta wave are indicative of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, as mentioned in Document [23]. This condition is characterized by an extra electrical pathway in the heart, which can lead to episodes of rapid heart rate. Beta blockers, which are medications that reduce the heart rate, are often used in the treatment of WPW syndrome. Therefore, option C would not be the least effective measure. A treadmill stress test (option B) could be useful in assessing the boy's cardiovascular response to exercise and identifying any exercise-induced arrhythmias. Holter monitoring (option A), which involves continuous ECG monitoring over a 24-hour period, could also be useful in detecting any intermittent arrhythmias that were not apparent during the initial ECG. Reassurance (option D) would be the least effective measure, as it does not involve any active intervention to manage or monitor the boy's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
