    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about each of the potential choices in the provided documents. Document [3] mentions that Cefotaxime is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Document [19] mentions that Cefoperazone is also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, there is no information about Cefaclor and Ceftriaxone being active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the provided documents. Therefore, the answer should be either Cefotaxime or Cefoperazone. Since the question is asking for a single answer, I need to find additional information to make a decision. Document [25] mentions that Cefoperazone is much more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than other third-generation cephalosporins. Therefore, I will choose Cefoperazone as the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
