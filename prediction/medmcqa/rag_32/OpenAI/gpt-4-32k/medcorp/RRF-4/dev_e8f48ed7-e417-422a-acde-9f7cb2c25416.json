    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Impression compound is a thermoplastic material, which means it can be heated and reshaped multiple times, so it is not a thermoset material. This is mentioned in Document [5]. It has low thermal conductivity as stated in Document [2]. There is no information in the documents provided that suggests impression compound warps at room temperature or shows increased flow when kneaded with water. However, the nature of thermoplastic materials like impression compound is such that they do not typically warp at room temperature, and their flow is usually increased with heat, not water. Therefore, the statement that impression compound shows increased flow when kneaded with water is likely incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
