    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The premaxilla is a part of the upper jaw of many animals. According to Document [0], the premaxilla in mice originates from the maxillary prominence and a part of the palate originates from the medial nasal prominence. Document [1] also mentions that the incisive bone, which is thought to be homologous to the premaxilla, is derived from the medial nasal prominence and the maxillary prominence. Document [12] states that the medial processes become the septum, philtrum, and premaxilla during the development of the nasal region in the embryo. Therefore, the premaxilla is derived from the medial nasal prominence, which is also known as the frontonasal process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Frontonasal process\"}"
