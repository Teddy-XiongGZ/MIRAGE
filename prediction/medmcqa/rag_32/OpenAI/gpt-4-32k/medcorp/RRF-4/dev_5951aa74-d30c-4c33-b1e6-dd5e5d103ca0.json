    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [1], about 85\u201390% of phosphorus in an average adult human is found in bones and teeth in the form of apatite. Therefore, the maximum amount of phosphate is seen in either bones or teeth. However, the options do not include teeth, but they do include bone and enamel, which is a part of the tooth. Therefore, the answer should be either bone or enamel. But since enamel is just a part of the tooth and bone is a larger structure, it is more likely that the maximum amount of phosphate is seen in bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
