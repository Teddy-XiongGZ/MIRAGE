    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Porosity in acrylic dentures is often caused by issues during the polymerization process. Document [0] mentions that significant porosity can weaken a denture base resin and promote staining, harboring of organisms such as Candida albicans, and bond failures between the artificial tooth and denture base resin. Document [19] mentions that microwave polymerization cycles and the specimen thickness of acrylic resin influenced porosity. Document [29] also mentions that minor porosity was identified in thin and more severe porosity in thicker areas of conventional resin specimens that underwent microwave polymerization. None of the documents mention a prolonged curing cycle, lack of sufficient pressure applied to flask, or insufficient acrylic resin monomer as causes of porosity. Therefore, the answer is not clearly stated in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
