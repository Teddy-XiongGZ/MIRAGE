    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to identify which statement about Influenza is not true. Statement A: Secondary attack rate 5-15%. This seems plausible as Influenza is highly contagious. Statement B: Virus shedding present before the patient presents with symptoms. This is also true as the virus can be spread before symptoms appear. Statement C: 1-5 years age is not a high risk age group. This is not true. According to Document 28, high-risk groups include children under 2 years of age. Although it doesn't specifically mention 1-5 years, it's generally understood that young children are at high risk. Statement D: Aquatic birds are reservoir. This is true as many types of Influenza, including avian flu, originate from birds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
