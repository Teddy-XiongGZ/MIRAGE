    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that dentifrices with certain ingredients can help with periodontal disease. For example, dentifrices containing triclosan/copolymer/fluoride, bioactive glass, calcium sodium phosphosilicate, arginine, and baking soda have been shown to have beneficial effects on periodontal health. However, none of the documents suggest that high abrasive content in dentifrices is beneficial for periodontal patients. In fact, high abrasive content could potentially harm the teeth and gums. Therefore, the best choice would be toothpastes with minimum abrasive content.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
