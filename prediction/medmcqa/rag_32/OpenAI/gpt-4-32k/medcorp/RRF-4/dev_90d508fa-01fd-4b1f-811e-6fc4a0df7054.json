    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the prevention of fracture in MO amalgam. Document [14] mentions that the thickness of amalgam in combined amalgam-composite restorations did not affect fracture resistance of the teeth. Document [19] mentions that bonding of the amalgam increased the resistance of the cusps to fracture. Document [29] mentions that pin orientation improved the fracture resistance of some specimens. However, none of the documents provide direct evidence that beveling of axiopulpal line angle, occlusal dovetails, pin retained amalgam, or removal of unsupported enamel rods prevent fracture of MO amalgam.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
