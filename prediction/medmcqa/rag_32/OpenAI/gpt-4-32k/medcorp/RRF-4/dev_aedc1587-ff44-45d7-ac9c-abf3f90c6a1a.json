    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a condition characterized by a third window phenomenon, which is a result of a dehiscence or 'hole' in the bone overlying the superior semicircular canal of the inner ear. This is mentioned in Document [26]. Tullio's phenomenon, which is sound-induced vertigo, is also a common symptom of SSCD as stated in Document [29]. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) is a useful investigation for SSCD, as it can detect abnormal responses to sound and pressure changes in the ear, as mentioned in Document [26]. However, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is not a characteristic feature of SSCD. In fact, SSCD often presents with conductive hearing loss rather than SNHL, as the dehiscence leads to abnormal conduction of sound waves in the ear. This is supported by Document [17] and Document [27].\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
