    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the optimum dose of BMP for osteogenesis. Document 27 mentions that the highest values of bone formation were achieved using BMP-2 dosages of 20 to 100 \u00b5g/g of coating. However, this is not in the same units as the answer choices. Document 16 mentions a dosage of 2.5 \u00b5g/mL of BMP-2 combined with undifferentiated BMSCs led to greater bone volume than the application of BMP-2 before LIPUS. This dosage is in the same units as the answer choices and falls within the range mentioned in Document 27.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
