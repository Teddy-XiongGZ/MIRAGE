    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times. This is a statistics question related to the concept of a confidence interval. In a normal distribution, 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, to find the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times, we subtract 2 standard deviations from the mean. In this case, the mean is 30 and the standard deviation is 1. So, 30 - 2*1 = 28.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
