    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic terminal is triggered by the arrival of a nerve impulse, which causes an influx of calcium ions. This influx of calcium ions promotes the fusion of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, leading to the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Therefore, preventing the influx of calcium ions would inhibit the release of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic terminal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Prevention of calcium influx\"}"
