    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of spermatogenesis involves several stages, starting from spermatogonia, which differentiate into primary spermatocytes. These primary spermatocytes then undergo the first meiotic division to form secondary spermatocytes. The secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to form spermatids, which then mature into spermatozoa. Independent assortment of chromosomes, which is a feature of meiosis, occurs during the first meiotic division. Therefore, the stage at which independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes occurs would be during the transition from primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocyte.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
