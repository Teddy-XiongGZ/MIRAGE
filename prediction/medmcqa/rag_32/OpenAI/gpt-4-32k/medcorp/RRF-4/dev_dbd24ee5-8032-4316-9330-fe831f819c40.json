    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple myeloma is a systemic disease that affects the bone marrow and can cause osteolytic lesions in various parts of the skeleton. Therefore, to confirm the diagnosis, a radiograph that can capture a broad view of the skeletal system would be ideal. A lateral skull radiograph would only provide a limited view of the skull, and a lateral oblique view would also be limited in scope. An anterior posterior view and a posterior anterior view would provide a broader view of the skeletal system, potentially capturing more areas of involvement. However, the documents do not provide a clear indication of which view would be more beneficial in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Anterior posterior view\"}"
