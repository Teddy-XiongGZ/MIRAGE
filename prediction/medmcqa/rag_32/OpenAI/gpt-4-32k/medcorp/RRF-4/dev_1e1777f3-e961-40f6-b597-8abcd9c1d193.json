    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A continuous variable is a variable whose value is obtained by measuring, i.e., one which can take on an uncountable set of values. For example, a variable over a non-empty range of the real numbers is continuous, if it can take on any value in that range. In terms of graphical representation, a histogram is used to represent continuous data, as it can display a large range of continuous values and their frequencies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
