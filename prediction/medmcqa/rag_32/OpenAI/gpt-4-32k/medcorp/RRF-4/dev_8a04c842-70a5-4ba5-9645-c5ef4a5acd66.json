    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Centric occlusion refers to the maximum contact between the opposing surfaces of the upper and lower teeth. According to Document [1], there should be even and simultaneous contacts of all posterior teeth when the mouth is closed and the condyles are in their most superior and anterior position. This suggests that all surfaces of the teeth could potentially be in contact. However, the specific surfaces mentioned in the options are not explicitly stated in the documents. Therefore, based on the general understanding of centric occlusion, it can be inferred that all surfaces of the teeth could potentially be in contact.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above.\"}"
