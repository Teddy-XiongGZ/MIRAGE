    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tooth eruption is a process where teeth enter the mouth and become visible. This process is complex and has been the subject of many theories over time. The most widely held current theory, as mentioned in documents [14], [16], and [30], is that the periodontal ligament provides the main impetus for the process. The periodontal ligament promotes eruption through the shrinking and cross-linking of their collagen fibers and the contraction of their fibroblasts. Therefore, the answer is not A, B, or C, as these options do not mention the periodontal ligament. The answer is D, as eruptive forces are generated by the periodontal ligament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
