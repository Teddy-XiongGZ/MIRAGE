    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best method to determine the position and integrity of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in a patient who has developed shock. The options provided are CECT (Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography), MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), USG (Ultrasonography), and a plain radiograph. MRI is generally contraindicated in patients with ICDs due to the risk of device malfunction or movement caused by the magnetic field. CECT and USG can provide detailed images, but they are more complex and time-consuming procedures. A plain radiograph, on the other hand, is a quick, simple, and widely available imaging modality that can provide immediate information about the position and integrity of the ICD, making it the most suitable choice in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
