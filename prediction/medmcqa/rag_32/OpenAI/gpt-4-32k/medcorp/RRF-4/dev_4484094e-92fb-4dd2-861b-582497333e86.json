    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about preventing cross infection in a post operative intensive care unit. Cross infection refers to the transmission of infectious agents from an infected person to another person. The documents suggest that surgical wounds can be contaminated both at surgery and postoperatively. The most common cause of wound infections is bacteria, which can be present on the patient's skin or spread due to contact with infected individuals. Therefore, the best method to prevent cross infection would be to eliminate the source of the bacteria and prevent its spread. Giving antibiotics to all other patients in the ward may not be effective as it does not address the source of the infection. Fumigating the ward or disinfecting it with sodium hypochlorite may kill bacteria present in the environment, but it does not prevent the spread of bacteria from the infected patients. On the other hand, proper hand washing is a simple and effective method to prevent the spread of bacteria. It can remove bacteria present on the hands of healthcare workers, which can be a source of cross infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
