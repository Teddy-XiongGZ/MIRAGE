    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment approach when there is a discrepancy of more than 10 mm in the arch length analysis of a dentition. Document [10] provides relevant information on this topic. It mentions that maxillary and mandibular tooth-size arch length discrepancy of 12.4 mm and 6.7 mm, respectively, were resolved by molar distalization, interproximal reduction, and arch expansion. This suggests that when there is a significant discrepancy in arch length, extraction of teeth might be necessary to resolve the issue. Therefore, the answer is not A or B, which suggest no extraction is required. The answer is also not D, which suggests proximal stripping, as the document does not mention this as a solution. The most appropriate answer is C, which suggests extraction of posterior teeth, as molar distalization is mentioned in the document as a method to resolve the discrepancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
