    "First, I will review the documents to find information about the CD markers of Mantle Cell Carcinoma. From Document [1], I found that Mantle Cell Lymphoma cells are positive for CD20 and CD5. There is no mention of CD23 or CD10. Document [2] also mentions that Mantle Cell Lymphoma cells stain positively with CD5 and CD20. Again, there is no mention of CD23 or CD10. Document [14] mentions that Mantle Cell Lymphoma is a subtype of B-cell lymphoma, due to CD5 positive antigen-naive pregerminal center B-cell. There is no mention of CD23 or CD10. From these documents, I can conclude that Mantle Cell Lymphoma cells are positive for CD5, but there is no information about CD23 or CD10. However, Document [22] mentions that Mantle Cell Lymphoma cells lack CD23. Therefore, the answer is that Mantle Cell Carcinoma shows CD 5+, CD 23-. { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I reviewed the documents to find information about the CD markers of Mantle Cell Carcinoma. I found that Mantle Cell Lymphoma cells are positive for CD5 in multiple documents. There was no mention of CD23 or CD10 in these documents. However, one document mentioned that Mantle Cell Lymphoma cells lack CD23. Therefore, I concluded that Mantle Cell Carcinoma shows CD 5+, CD 23-.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }"
