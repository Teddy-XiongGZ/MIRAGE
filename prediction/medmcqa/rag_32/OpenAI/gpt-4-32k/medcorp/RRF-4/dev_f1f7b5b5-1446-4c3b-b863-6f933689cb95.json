    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Callus formation is a part of the bone healing process. According to Document [13], callus growth is initiated subsequent to a peak in displacement which occurs within the first 42 days. This suggests that some movement at the fracture site can stimulate callus formation. The other options such as rigid immobilization, compression plating, and intraosseous nailing are methods used to stabilize a fracture and limit movement, which according to the documents, does not promote callus formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Movement at fracture site\"}"
