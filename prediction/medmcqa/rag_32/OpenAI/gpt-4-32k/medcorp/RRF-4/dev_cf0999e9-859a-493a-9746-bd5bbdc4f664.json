    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. It is used to treat severe hypoglycemia, a condition characterized by low blood glucose levels. From the documents, it is clear that glucagon is effective in managing hypoglycemia in various situations, including in large for date babies, infants of diabetic mothers, and in cases of persistent neonatal hypoglycemia. However, in the case of Nesidioblastosis, which is a condition characterized by hyperinsulinism, the use of glucagon may not be effective. This is because in Nesidioblastosis, there is an overproduction of insulin, which would counteract the glucose-raising effects of glucagon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Nesidioblastosis\"}"
