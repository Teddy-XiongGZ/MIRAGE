    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A condylar fracture that leads to disruption of the TMJ anteriorly is not a simple fracture, as it involves more than just a break in the bone. It's also not a compound fracture, as this term is typically used to describe a fracture where the bone pierces the skin.

In this case, the fracture is complex because it involves not only the bone but also the joint, leading to a disruption of the TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Complex fracture\"}"
