    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most metabolically active layer in the bone. From the documents, we can see that the cortical bone, also known as compact bone, accounts for 80% of the total bone mass and is much denser than cancellous bone (Document 0). However, it is also mentioned that cancellous bone has a much larger surface area per unit volume and a greater rate of metabolic activity (Document 2). The periosteum and endosteum are layers that cover the outer and inner surfaces of the bone respectively, but they are not described as being the most metabolically active. Therefore, the cancellous bone seems to be the most metabolically active layer in the bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
