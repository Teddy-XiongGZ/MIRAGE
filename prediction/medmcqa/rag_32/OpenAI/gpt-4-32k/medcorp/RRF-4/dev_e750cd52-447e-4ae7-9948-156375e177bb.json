    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best noninvasive investigation to check for the viability of the myocardium. Document [30] states that myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE), which is a type of echocardiography, can rapidly provide information on myocardial viability at the bedside without ionizing radiation. It also mentions that newer studies have demonstrated the comparable sensitivities and specificities of MCE to single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT), cardiac myocardial resonance imaging and PET for the detection of myocardial viability. Document [23] also mentions that stress redistribution single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or FDG-PET is also an option, though dobutamine echocardiography has a slightly better predictive value. Document [26] mentions that Cardiac MRI with Gadolinium is the contrast agent, and absence of enhancement suggests viable myocardium that would respond favorably to revascularization. However, the question asks for the best noninvasive investigation, and based on the documents, echocardiography seems to be the most practical and effective method.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
