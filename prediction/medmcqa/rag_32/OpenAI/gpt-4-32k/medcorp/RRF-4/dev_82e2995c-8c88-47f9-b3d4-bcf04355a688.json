    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes an abdominal ultrasound showing diffuse gallbladder wall thickening, hyperechoic nodules at the neck, and comet tail artifacts. According to Document [0], the characteristic findings of adenomyomatosis are gallbladder wall thickening, Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, and the calculi or cholesterol crystals often found in sinuses. On ultrasound scanning, adenomyomatosis is seen as gallbladder wall thickening, intramural cystic spaces, and echogenic intramural foci (cholesterol crystals in the Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses) that show comet tail artifacts. This matches the description given in the question. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is adenomyomatosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
