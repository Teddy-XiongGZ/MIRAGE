    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thrombolysis is a treatment used in acute ischemic stroke patients. According to the documents, it is typically administered within a certain time frame after the onset of the stroke, usually within 3 to 4.5 hours (Document 2, Document 3, Document 23, Document 29). This rules out option D. High blood pressure is also mentioned as a contraindication for thrombolysis (Document 0, Document 20), which makes option B a valid answer. The documents do not provide clear information about the age limit for thrombolysis, but they do mention that it has been used in patients over 80 years old (Document 17, Document 19), which suggests that age is not a strict contraindication, ruling out option A. Lastly, the documents do not provide clear information about the extent of edema on a CT scan as a contraindication for thrombolysis, making it difficult to rule out option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
