    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The role of plasticizer in synthetic resins in dentistry is not to increase smoothness or bulk, nor to prevent polymerisation shrinkage. According to Document [1], plasticizers are used in soft polymer gel systems to determine the gel strength and gelation time. They influence the rate of gel formation and the subsequent gel strength. Therefore, the role of plasticizer in synthetic resins in dentistry is to reduce the softening and fusion temperature, which in turn affects the gelation rate and strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
