    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several components of calculus, including hydroxyapatite, octacalcium phosphate, magnesium whitlockite, and brushite. However, the main component is mentioned in Document [2], which states that the mineral proportion of calculus consists primarily of calcium phosphate crystals organized into four principal mineral phases, listed in order of decreasing ratio of phosphate to calcium. The first one listed, which would have the highest ratio of phosphate to calcium, is hydroxyapatite. This suggests that hydroxyapatite is the main crystalline component of calculus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
