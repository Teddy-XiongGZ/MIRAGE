    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reversible cell injury is characterized by certain features that can be reversed if the damaging stimulus is removed. According to Document [1], reversible cell injury can lead to cellular swelling, which can be due to damage to the sodium-potassium membrane pump. This can also cause changes such as blebbing and distortion of microvilli, which is mentioned in the same document. Document [2] also mentions that in reversible injury, cells and intracellular organelles typically become swollen. However, none of the documents mention 'Dens deposition of mitochondria' as a feature of reversible cell injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
