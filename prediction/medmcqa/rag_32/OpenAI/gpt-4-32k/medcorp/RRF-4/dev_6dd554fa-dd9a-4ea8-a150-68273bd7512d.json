    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the term that describes abnormal development of a joint. Looking at the documents, none of them directly define the terms synostosis or dysostosis. However, Document [5] mentions synostosis as a result of an error during the dividing of embryonic cells in utero, leading to bone fusion. This could be interpreted as abnormal development of a joint. On the other hand, dysostosis is not mentioned in any of the documents. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that synostosis is associated with abnormal joint development, but there is no evidence to suggest that dysostosis is.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
