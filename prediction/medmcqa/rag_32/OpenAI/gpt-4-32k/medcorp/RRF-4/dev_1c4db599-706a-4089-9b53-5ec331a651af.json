    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what enzymes are involved in the calcification process. From Document [0], I learned that carbonic anhydrase is involved in calcification processes. Document [1] mentions that alkaline phosphatase is involved in the mineralization process. Document [2] mentions that matrix vesicles promote calcification through phosphatase activity. Document [20] mentions that inorganic phosphate directly regulates human smooth muscle cell calcification through a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter mechanism. Document [21] mentions that tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase plays a role in vascular calcification. Document [30] mentions that phosphatase enzymes, which are membrane-bound, initiate calcification. Document [31] mentions that the enzyme tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) plays a key role in creating and maintaining healthy bones, and managing calcium and phosphate in the body. From these documents, it is clear that alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase are involved in the calcification process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase\"}"
