    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The finish line of a crown refers to the edge of the tooth preparation. It is the border or terminal portion of the prepared tooth. The type of finish line can affect the fit and aesthetics of the crown. According to Document [0], the metal frameworks with 0.5 mm and 1 mm short of the finish line are recommended for anterior metal ceramic restoration having adequate fracture resistance. Document [25] suggests that the chamfer type of finish line resulted in the best cervical adaptation of the metal crowns. Document [29] also supports that the chamfer finish line produced significantly lower marginal discrepancy values. Therefore, based on these documents, the chamfer finish line seems to be the best choice for anterior metal ceramic crowns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Heavy chamfer\"}"
