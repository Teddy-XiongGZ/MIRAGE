    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tetrazolium chloride staining is a technique used in autopsies to identify areas of myocardial infarction. The principle behind this staining technique is that the enzyme dehydrogenase, which is present in viable cells, will convert the yellow tetrazolium salt into a red formazan dye. Therefore, the viable myocardium will stain red, while the infarcted or dead myocardium will not stain and will appear pale or unstained.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Pink\"}"
