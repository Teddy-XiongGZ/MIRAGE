The median is the middle number in a set when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. If the number 85 is mistakenly entered instead of 58, it will not change the position of the median if the number of observations (10 in this case) remains the same. Therefore, the median will not change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased mean. no change in median\"}"
