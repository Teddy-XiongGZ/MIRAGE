    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristic of venous blood flow in the lower limb as observed in duplex Doppler. From the documents, it is clear that duplex Doppler is used to assess the blood flow in the veins of the lower limbs. However, none of the documents directly mention the characteristic of the blood flow as being monophasic, biphasic, triphasic, or non-phasic. Therefore, I need to infer the answer based on the information provided. Document [20] mentions that 'Outward flow could be demonstrated in 21% of perforators in normal limbs. Flow on release of distal compression occurred in 33% to 44% of perforators in limbs with evidence of venous disease but in none of the perforators in limbs without evidence of venous disease.' This suggests that the blood flow in the veins of the lower limbs can change direction under certain conditions, which indicates that it is not monophasic (single phase). However, the document does not specify whether the blood flow is biphasic (two phases), triphasic (three phases), or non-phasic (no distinct phases). Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the most accurate answer would be that the characteristic of venous blood flow in the lower limb in duplex Doppler is biphasic, as it can change direction under certain conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
