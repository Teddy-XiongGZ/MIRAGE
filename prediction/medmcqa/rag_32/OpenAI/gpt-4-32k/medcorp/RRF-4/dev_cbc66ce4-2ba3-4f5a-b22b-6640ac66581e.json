    "First, I will review the documents to identify the structures that lie deep to the hyoglossus muscle. From Document [2] and Document [3], I can see that the structures that are medial/deep to the hyoglossus are the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve 9), the stylohyoid ligament, and the lingual artery and lingual vein. From Document [24], I can see that the lingual artery passes inferior to the hyoglossus. From Document [29], I can see that the hypoglossal nerve moves forward lateral to the hyoglossus and medial to the styloglossus muscles and lingual nerve. From Document [30], I can see that the lingual nerve crosses obliquely to the side of the tongue beneath the constrictor pharyngis superior and styloglossus, and then between the hyoglossus and deep part of the submandibular gland. From these documents, I can conclude that the hypoglossal nerve, lingual artery, and lingual nerve are deep to the hyoglossus muscle. However, I did not find any information about the stylohyoid muscle or the geniohyoid muscle being deep to the hyoglossus muscle. Therefore, I will need to review the documents again to find information about the location of the stylohyoid muscle and the geniohyoid muscle. From Document [15], I can see that the styloglossus muscle arises from the anterior and lateral surfaces of the styloid process near its apex, and from the stylomandibular ligament. It passes inferiorly and anteriorly between the internal and external carotid arteries, and divides upon the side of the tongue near its dorsal surface, blending with the fibers of the longitudinalis inferior in front of the hyoglossus. From Document [17], I can see that the geniohyoid muscles are immediately superior to the mylohyoid muscles in the floor of the mouth and inferior to the genioglossus muscles that form part of the root of the tongue. From these documents, I can conclude that the stylohyoid muscle and the geniohyoid muscle are not deep to the hyoglossus muscle. Therefore, the answer to the question is either the stylohyoid muscle or the geniohyoid muscle. However, the question asks for the structure that is not deep to the hyoglossus muscle, and the stylohyoid muscle is not a structure, but a muscle. Therefore, the answer to the question is the geniohyoid muscle.
