    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an anticholinergic agent that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. From the documents, Document 9 mentions that anticholinergic agents can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause central nervous system effects. However, it also mentions that some anticholinergics, such as trospium chloride, darifenacin, and fesoterodine, are actively transported away from the brain. Document 23 also mentions that trospium chloride does not appear to have significant CNS penetration. However, none of the documents mention the specific anticholinergic agents listed in the question choices. Therefore, I would need to rely on external medical knowledge to answer this question. From my knowledge, Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic medication that does not cross the blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
