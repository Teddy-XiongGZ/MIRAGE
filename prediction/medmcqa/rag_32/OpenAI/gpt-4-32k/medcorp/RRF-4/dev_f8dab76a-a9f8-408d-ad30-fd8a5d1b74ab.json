    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a term that describes a substance appearing different under varying conditions of color. Looking at the documents, Document [0] mentions a term 'metamer mismatching' which refers to the fact that two objects reflecting metameric light under one illumination may reflect non-metameric light under a second; so two objects appearing as having the same colour under one illuminant can appear as having different colours under a second. This seems to match the description in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metamerism\"}"
