    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the indications for exchange transfusion in Rh Iso Immunisation. Document [12] and [14] mention that exchange transfusion is used when bilirubin reaches either the high or medium risk lines on the nonogram provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Figure 4). Cord bilirubin >4 is also indicative of the need for exchange transfusion. However, there is no mention of cord blood hemoglobin being less than 10 g % as an indication for exchange transfusion.

Cord bilirubin is more than 5 mg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
