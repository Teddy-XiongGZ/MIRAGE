    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The major connector in a dental prosthesis serves multiple functions. According to Document [0], it is crucial for the performance of prosthetics and its stiffness is influenced by the supporting tissues. Document [8] suggests that the design of the major connector affects the mobility of the denture during oral functions. Document [11] emphasizes that the major connector should resist deformation by occlusal stresses, thus indicating its role in resisting flexing and torque. Document [22] suggests that the major connector contributes to the rigidity of the denture. Therefore, the major connector connects parts of the prosthesis on one side of the arch with those on the opposite side, distributes forces over the entire supporting structure, and resists flexing and torque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
