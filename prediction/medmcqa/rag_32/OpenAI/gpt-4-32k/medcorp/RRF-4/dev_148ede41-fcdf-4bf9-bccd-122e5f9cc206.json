    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Impression compound is a thermoplastic material used in dentistry for making impressions of oral structures. According to Document [0], impression compound is classified as a reversible and rigid material. Document [1] explains that impression compound is a mucocompressive material, meaning that it impresses the mucosa when subjected to compression. Document [4] further describes it as a thermoplastic, rigid and reversible impression material. Document [7] provides more specific properties of impression compound, stating that it has low thermal conductivity, high viscosity, and reaches fusion temperature at 43.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the base of impression compound has low thermal conductivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
