    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the characteristic that is not a differentiating factor between an enamel hatchet and a chisel. Step 2: Review the documents for information on enamel hatchets and chisels. Document [4] mentions enamel hatchets but does not provide specific details about their characteristics. Document [5] provides more information, stating that dental hatchets are used to widen the entrance of the tooth cavity and slice away the thin carious enamel. However, it does not provide specific details about the characteristics of the hatchet's blade or handle. Document [15] mentions hatchets but in a different context, not related to dental hatchets. Document [27] also mentions enamel hatchets but does not provide specific details about their characteristics. Step 3: Since the documents do not provide enough information to answer the question, I will use my medical knowledge to answer the question. An enamel hatchet is a dental instrument used in dentistry, particularly in cavity preparation. It is characterized by a blade that is curved in one plane only and is perpendicular to the long axis of the handle. The blade of an enamel hatchet is not necessarily larger or heavier than that of a chisel. Therefore, the characteristic that does not differentiate an enamel hatchet from a chisel is that the blade is heavier. Step 4: Choose the answer. The answer is D. Blade is heavier. Step 5: Format the answer in JSON. The final output will be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the characteristic that is not a differentiating factor between an enamel hatchet and a chisel.
