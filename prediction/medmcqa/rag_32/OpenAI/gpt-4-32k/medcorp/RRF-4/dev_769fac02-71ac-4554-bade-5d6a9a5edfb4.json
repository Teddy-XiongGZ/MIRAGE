    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I will look for information about each of the cement types in the documents. Document [1] mentions that resin cement can cause pulp reactions, but it's not one of the options. Document [2] mentions that many cements are acidic and irritate the pulp, but it doesn't specify which ones. Document [3] talks about glass ionomer cements causing pulp sensitivity, but again, it's not one of the options. Document [6] mentions that neither polycarboxylate cement nor zinc phosphate cement has any notable irritating effect on the pulp. Document [15] mentions that Zinc Phosphate cement can irritate nerve pulp. Document [17] mentions that eugenol, which is part of Zinc oxide-eugenol cement, can produce chronic inflammation and result in pulp necrosis. Document [20] mentions that most cements are irritating to the pulp especially when used as luting agents and when used less than 0.5 mm from it, but it doesn't specify which ones. Document [28] mentions that resin-based luting cements can be cytotoxic to pulp cells, but it's not one of the options. Based on this information, it seems that both Zinc phosphate and Zinc oxide-eugenol cement can be irritating to the pulp. However, the evidence for Zinc oxide-eugenol cement causing irritation seems stronger, as it mentions specifically that it can produce chronic inflammation and result in pulp necrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Zinc oxide-eugenol cement\"}"
