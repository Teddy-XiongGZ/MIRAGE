    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the time when the first permanent molars begin to calcify. Document [2] suggests that calcification in the mandibular permanent first molar commences much earlier than has been previously reported. However, it does not provide a specific time frame. Document [15] provides more specific information, stating that the development of first molars was earlier in girls than boys, particularly during the middle phase of development. However, it does not provide a specific time frame either. Document [13] states that the first permanent tooth usually appears in the mouth at around six years of age, but it does not specify when the calcification process begins. Document [27] suggests that dental practitioners have to wait until the age of 10, 11 and even 12 to extract the first molars, when the furcation is formed. This suggests that the calcification process begins much earlier. However, none of the documents provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, I will choose the option that seems most likely based on the information provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
