    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of gingival retraction cord that can be used in hypertensive patients. Document [0] mentions that the use of epinephrine in hypertensive patients was associated with small, nonsignificant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, it might not be the best choice for hypertensive patients. Document [17] suggests that there is little indication for the use of epinephrine-containing retraction cords and recommends the use of other astringent gingival deflection agents such as alum, aluminum sulfate, and aluminum chloride which exert no systemic effects. Therefore, a retraction cord with 8% aluminium chloride might be a safer choice for hypertensive patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
