    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to an enzyme at a site other than the active site. This changes the shape of the enzyme and prevents it from binding to its substrate, thus decreasing the rate of the reaction. The maximum rate of the reaction (Vmax) is decreased because fewer enzyme molecules are available to catalyze the reaction. However, the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate (Km) is not affected because the inhibitor does not interfere with the active site where the substrate binds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Decrease in Vmax\"}"
