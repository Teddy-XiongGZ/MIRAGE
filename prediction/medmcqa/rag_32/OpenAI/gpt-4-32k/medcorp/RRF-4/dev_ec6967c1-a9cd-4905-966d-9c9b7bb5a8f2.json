    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment plan for a parasymphysial fracture in a 55-year-old man. Document [20] mentions that the incidence and causes of mandibular fractures reflect trauma patterns within the community and can provide a guide to the design of programs geared toward prevention and treatment. It also mentions that the most common site is parasymphysis fracture. Document [24] discusses the use of a traction screw to aid in fracture reduction in bilateral parasymphysis fracture of the mandible. Document [21] compares circummandibular wiring with resorbable bone plates in pediatric mandibular fractures, but this may not be applicable to a 55-year-old man. Document [6] evaluates the conventional intraoral mandibular vestibular incision approach in symphysis and parasymphysis fractures and compares prognosis of the incision site, fracture healing, and associated complications with the staircase modification of the intraoral mandibular vestibular incision approach for symphysis and parasymphysis fractures. It concludes that the conventional method and the staircase modification of the intraoral mandibular vestibular approach have similar treatment outcomes in terms of osteosynthesis and soft tissue healing. Based on these documents, it seems that a compression plate could be a suitable treatment for a parasymphysial fracture in a 55-year-old man.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Compression plate is must\"}"
