    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [1] mentions that polishing an amalgam restoration is an important step of the restorative procedure and it improves the marginal integrity and surface smoothness of restorations. Document [3] also mentions that polished restorations have substantially superior surface texture and less likelihood of surface discoloration. Document [5] states that polishing appears to be the best finishing technique for amalgam restorations. Document [7] suggests that burnishing process improves the marginal adaptation. Document [23] mentions that contouring of restorations and removal of marginal overhangs is sufficient to permit adequate tooth cleaning and that further polishing does not result in further improvement of gingival health. None of the documents suggest that polishing increases the tarnish and corrosion resistance or the compressive strength of the amalgam restoration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
