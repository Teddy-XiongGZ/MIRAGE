    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best way to fill a bony defect. Document [1] suggests that hydroxyapatite ceramic (Endobon) is useful for filling bony defects in carefully selected trauma patients. Document [4] suggests that a patient's own bone can provide an alternative with all the immediate and long-term biological advantages. Document [14] suggests that Reamer-irrigator-aspirator bone graft has shown to be a very bioactive material and has been used successfully for the treatment of bone defects. Document [15] suggests that autologous cancellous bone grafting remains the gold standard in the treatment of bone defects. Document [22] suggests that autologous bone grafts had the best osteoconductive properties during the initial healing period. Considering all these documents, it seems that autograft, which is the patient's own bone, is the best way to fill a bony defect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Autograft\"}"
