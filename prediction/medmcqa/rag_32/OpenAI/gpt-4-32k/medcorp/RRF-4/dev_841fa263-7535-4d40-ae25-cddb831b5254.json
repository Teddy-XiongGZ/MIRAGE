    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case where a woman develops severe vaginal bleeding 30 minutes after delivery, and a sonogram reveals retained placental tissue. This suggests that the placenta did not fully detach from the uterine wall after childbirth, which is a characteristic of placenta accreta. Placenta accreta is a condition where the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall. This can cause complications during delivery, such as heavy bleeding if the placenta is not completely removed. The other options, membranous placenta, placenta fenestrae, and placenta succenturiata, do not typically present with these symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
