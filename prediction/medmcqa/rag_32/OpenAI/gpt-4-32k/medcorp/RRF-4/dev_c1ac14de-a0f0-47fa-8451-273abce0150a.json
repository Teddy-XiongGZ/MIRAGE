    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retinoblastoma is a type of eye cancer that originates in the retina. According to Document [0], the tumor can spread through optic nerve invasion, with the tumor cells spreading into the subarachnoid space and into the brain. Metastatic spread can also occur in regional lymph nodes, liver, lungs, bones, and brain. However, the document does not specify which mode of spread is the most common. Document [3] also mentions the spread of retinoblastoma through cerebrospinal fluid seeding, which is a form of direct invasion. Document [31] also emphasizes the importance of subpial extension of retinoblastoma, which is a form of direct invasion. However, none of the documents explicitly state which mode of spread is the most common. Based on the information provided, optic nerve invasion is mentioned multiple times as a mode of spread, suggesting that it might be the most common.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
