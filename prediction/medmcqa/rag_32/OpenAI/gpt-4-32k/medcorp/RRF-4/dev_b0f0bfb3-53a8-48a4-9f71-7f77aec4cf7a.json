    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First pass metabolism refers to the liver's metabolism of a drug before it reaches systemic circulation. This process can greatly reduce the bioavailability of the drug. According to the documents, intravenous, sublingual, and intradermal routes of administration bypass the first pass effect because they allow drugs to be absorbed directly into the systemic circulation. However, oral administration does not bypass the first pass effect. When a drug is administered orally, it is absorbed by the digestive system and enters the hepatic portal system. It is carried through the portal vein into the liver before it reaches the rest of the body. Therefore, the liver metabolizes many orally administered drugs, sometimes to such an extent that only a small amount of active drug emerges from the liver to the rest of the circulatory system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
