    "Based on the provided documents, the characteristic features of Apert syndrome include bicoronal craniosynostosis (Document [23]), midface hypoplasia (Document [26]), and complex syndactyly (Document [14]). However, there is no mention of mandibular hypoplasia as a diagnostic feature of Apert syndrome. So, the step-by-step thinking would be: 1.
