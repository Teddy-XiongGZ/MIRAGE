    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about measuring variation between two different units. Variance and standard deviation are measures of dispersion within a single unit of measurement, so they are not suitable for comparing different units. The range is also not suitable as it only provides the difference between the highest and lowest values within a single unit of measurement. The coefficient of variation, however, is a dimensionless number that allows for comparison between data sets with different units or widely different means, as stated in Document [7]. Therefore, the coefficient of variation is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
