    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zygomatic process of the maxilla is a part of the maxilla bone that articulates with the zygomatic bone. The masseter muscle originates from the zygomatic arch and the maxillary process on the zygomatic bone, and then it inserts at the ramus of the mandible. The buccinator muscle originates from the alveolar process of the maxilla and mandible, buccinator crest, and temporomandibular joint. The middle temporal muscle is not a recognized muscle in human anatomy. The medial pterygoid muscle originates from the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and the tuberosity of the maxilla, and inserts along the medial surface of the mandibular ramus. Therefore, the muscle that attaches to the zygomatic process of the maxilla is the masseter muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
