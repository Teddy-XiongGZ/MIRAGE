    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of an Ellis class-III dental fracture in a child. According to Document [2], Ellis class IV fracture was the most common dental injury and most of the dental traumatic injuries in permanent teeth were treated by root canal treatment. However, the question is about an Ellis class-III fracture, not class IV. Ellis class-III fractures involve the enamel, dentin, and pulp. According to general dental knowledge, when the pulp is exposed due to a traumatic injury, a pulpotomy or pulpectomy is usually performed to remove the damaged pulp tissue and prevent infection. The choice between pulpotomy and pulpectomy often depends on the extent of the damage and the vitality of the pulp. Since the question does not provide information about the extent of the pulp damage or its vitality, it's hard to definitively choose between pulpotomy and pulpectomy. However, since the patient is a child, it's more likely that a pulpotomy (Cvek's pulpotomy) would be performed, as this procedure is often used in children with traumatic injuries to preserve the vitality of the pulp. Therefore, the first step of management would likely be to take a radiograph to assess the extent of the damage and then perform a Cvek's pulpotomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
