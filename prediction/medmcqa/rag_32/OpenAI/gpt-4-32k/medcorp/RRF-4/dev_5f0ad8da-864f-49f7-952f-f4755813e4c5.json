    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcium levels in the blood are regulated by two hormones: calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH). According to Document [21], calcitonin is released by the thyroid gland when plasma ionized calcium levels are high or rising, and it stimulates the incorporation of calcium into bone, effectively lowering blood calcium levels. On the other hand, PTH is released by the parathyroid glands when the plasma calcium level falls below the normal range in order to raise it, as stated in Document [19]. Therefore, the hormone that increases calcium levels in the blood is parathyroid hormone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Parathormone\"}"
