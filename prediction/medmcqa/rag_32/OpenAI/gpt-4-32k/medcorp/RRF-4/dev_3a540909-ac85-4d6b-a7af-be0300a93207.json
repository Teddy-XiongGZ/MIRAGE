    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking which of the given options is not a feature of non-paralytic polio. Step 2: Review the documents for information on non-paralytic polio. Document [20] mentions that in children, nonparalytic meningitis is the most likely consequence of CNS involvement, and paralysis occurs in only one in 1000 cases. Document [21] mentions that nonparalytic poliomyelitis is a condition with symptoms ranging from mild illness to aseptic meningitis. Document [29] discusses a study examining patients with previous nonparalytic poliomyelitis in search of muscle atrophy, weakness, and other late symptoms of poliomyelitis. Step 3: Compare the information found in the documents with the answer choices. None of the documents mention the specific features listed in the answer choices in relation to non-paralytic polio. Step 4: Use medical knowledge to make an educated guess. Non-paralytic polio typically does not involve the loss of motor function, so it would not cause absent deep tendon reflexes (A) or head drop (B), which are signs of muscle weakness or paralysis. Nuchal rigidity (C) is a sign of meningitis, which can occur in non-paralytic polio. The knee heel test (D) is a neurological examination used to assess coordination, and there's no specific mention of it being negative in non-paralytic polio. Based on these steps, the answer is likely to be A. Absent deep tendon reflexes, as this is a sign of paralysis, which does not occur in non-paralytic polio. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a feature that is not associated with non-paralytic polio.
