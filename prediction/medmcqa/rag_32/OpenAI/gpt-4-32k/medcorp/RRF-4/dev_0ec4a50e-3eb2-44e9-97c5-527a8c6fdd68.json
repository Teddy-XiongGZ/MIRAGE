    "First, I will review the documents to find information about the muscles that are inserted into the greater tubercle of the humerus. From Document [1], I learned that the greater tubercle is where the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles are attached. From Document [4], I learned that the subscapularis muscle inserts onto the lesser tubercle and works to medially, or internally, rotate the humerus. From Document [21], I learned that the subscapularis muscle originates from the subscapular fossa of the scapula and inserts onto the lesser tubercle of the humerus, facilitating internal rotation of the humerus. From this information, I can conclude that the subscapularis muscle is not inserted into the greater tubercle of the humerus, but rather the lesser tubercle. Therefore, the answer is D. Subscapularis. The JSON output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I reviewed the documents to find information about the muscles that are inserted into the greater tubercle of the humerus. I found that the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles are attached to the greater tubercle. However, the subscapularis muscle is inserted onto the lesser tubercle of the humerus, not the greater tubercle. Therefore, the subscapularis muscle is not inserted into the greater tubercle of the humerus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
