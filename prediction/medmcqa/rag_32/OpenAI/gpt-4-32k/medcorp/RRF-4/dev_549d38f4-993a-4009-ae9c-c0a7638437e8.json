    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [8] suggests that the thickness of 4 mm is most adequate for the use of MTA as a root-end filling material. However, this is not one of the options provided. Document [14] also suggests that there is no significant difference in microleakage between MTA thicknesses of 1 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm. Given these findings, the best option from the provided choices would be 3 mm, as it is the closest to the suggested 4 mm and is within the range where no significant difference in microleakage was found.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
