    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyaluronidase is an enzyme produced by certain bacteria that allows them to spread in the body by breaking down hyaluronic acid, a substance that binds cells together. This enzyme is often referred to as a 'spreading factor' because it allows bacteria to move through tissue layers, promoting the spread of the infection. Coagulase, on the other hand, is an enzyme that causes blood clotting, helping bacteria to evade the immune system by hiding within a clot. Peroxidase is an enzyme that is not typically associated with bacterial spread, and bradykinin is not an enzyme but a peptide that causes blood vessels to dilate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
