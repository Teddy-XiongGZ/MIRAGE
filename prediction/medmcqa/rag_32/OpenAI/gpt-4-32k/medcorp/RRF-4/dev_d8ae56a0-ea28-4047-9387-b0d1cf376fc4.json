    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, which is the inner lining of the heart. It commonly affects the heart valves. From the documents, it is not explicitly stated which condition among mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect), and ASD (Atrial Septal Defect) is least likely to develop infective endocarditis. However, it is known that infective endocarditis commonly affects the valves of the heart due to the absence of blood supply to the heart valve, which results in a decreased immune response to the valve leaflets. This is mentioned in Document [16]. Both mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis are conditions that involve the heart valves, making them more susceptible to infective endocarditis. On the other hand, VSD and ASD are defects in the septum, the wall that separates the left and right sides of the heart, and not the valves. Therefore, it can be inferred that infective endocarditis is least common in VSD or ASD compared to mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis. However, between VSD and ASD, it is not clear which one is less likely to develop infective endocarditis as the documents do not provide specific information on this.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. VSD or D. ASD\"}"
