    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about the internal surface of the mandible. Step 2: Document [0] mentions that the superior and inferior mental spines (also known as genial tubercles) and the mylohyoid ridge are present on the internal surface of the mandible. Step 3: Document [11] and [12] mention that the lingula is present on the medial side of the mandible, which is part of the internal surface. Step 4: Document [9] and [20] mention that the mental foramen is an important landmark on the external mandibular surface, not the internal surface. Based on these findings, the mental foramen is not present on the internal surface of the mandible. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first reviewed the documents for information about the internal surface of the mandible. I found that the genial tubercle, mylohyoid ridge, and lingula are all present on the internal surface of the mandible. However, the mental foramen is mentioned as being on the external surface of the mandible, not the internal surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Mental foramen\"}"
