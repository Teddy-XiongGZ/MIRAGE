    "The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. The question is asking about a pattern of change in disease mortality and morbidity where infectious diseases are replaced by degenerative and manmade disorders as the main cause of morbidity and mortality. 2. Document [4] titled \"Epidemiological transition\" discusses a theory aimed at explaining changes in population disease and mortality profiles. It mentions the transition from infectious diseases to conditions referred to as degenerative or non-communicable. 3. None of the other documents seem to provide information about the other choices (Demographic transition, Paradoxical transition, Reversal of transition). 4. Therefore, based on the information provided in Document [4], the answer is likely to be \"Epidemiological transition\". The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a pattern of change in disease mortality and morbidity where infectious diseases are replaced by degenerative and manmade disorders as the main cause of morbidity and mortality.
