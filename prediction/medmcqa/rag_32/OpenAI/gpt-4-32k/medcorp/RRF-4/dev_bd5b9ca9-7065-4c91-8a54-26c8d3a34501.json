    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient was on a high protein diet and raw eggs, which means he was consuming a lot of protein and very little carbohydrates. The body usually uses glucose as its primary source of energy, but when there is a lack of glucose, it starts to break down stored fat and protein for energy through a process called gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate carboxylase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in gluconeogenesis, converting pyruvate into oxaloacetate, which is then used to produce glucose. If this enzyme is inhibited, the body would not be able to produce enough glucose, leading to hypoglycemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pyruvate Carboxylase\"}"
