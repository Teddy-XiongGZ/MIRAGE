    "Step 1: Erythroblastosis fetalis is a condition that primarily involves the destruction of the fetus's red blood cells by maternal antibodies. This is usually due to incompatibility in the blood group systems between the mother and the fetus. Step 2: From Document [18], it is clear that numerous blood group systems have been implicated in HDFN including, ABO, Rhesus (Rh), Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNS, Diego. P, Lutheran, and Xg. Rhesus and ABO are by far the most common. Step 3: The Rhesus system includes Anti C, Anti D, and Anti E, which are all mentioned in the answer choices. Therefore, these are involved in Erythroblastosis fetalis. Step 4: The Lewis system is not mentioned in the document as being involved in Erythroblastosis fetalis. Based on these steps, the answer is Anti Lewis.
