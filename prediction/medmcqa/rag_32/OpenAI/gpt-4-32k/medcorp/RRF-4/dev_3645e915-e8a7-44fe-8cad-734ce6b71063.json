    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intra-epithelial bulla refers to blisters that form within the epidermal layer of the skin. Document [0] and Document [2] mention that intraepidermal bullae are found in bullosis diabeticorum. However, this condition is not among the answer choices. Therefore, I need to look for information about the conditions listed in the answer choices. Document [21] mentions that in mucous membrane pemphigoid, the autoimmune reaction occurs in the skin, specifically at the level of the basement membrane, which connects the lower skin layer (dermis) to the upper skin layer (epidermis). This suggests that the bullae in this condition are not intra-epithelial. Document [27] mentions a case of autoimmune bullous dermatosis with features of pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid. It mentions that the presence of suprabasal cleavage in the oral mucosa, acantholytic cells in the blister cavity, the deposition of IgG at the intercellular space of the perilesional epidermis, and circulating anti-ICS antibodies strongly suggested that this case was primarily pemphigus. This suggests that intra-epithelial bullae are found in pemphigus. Therefore, the answer is A. Pemphigus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
