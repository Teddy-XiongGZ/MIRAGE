    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malaria is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, which injects sporozoites into the bloodstream. These sporozoites then travel to the liver, where they mature into trophozoites and multiply. Eventually, they burst out of the liver cells and invade red blood cells, where they continue to multiply as merozoites. When a mosquito bites an infected person, it can ingest these merozoites and pass them on to the next person it bites. In the case of transfusion-associated malaria, the parasites are directly introduced into the recipient's bloodstream, bypassing the liver stage. Therefore, the form of the parasite that would be present in the blood and cause a shorter incubation period would be the merozoites.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Merozoites\"}"
