    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's condition is described as having a small chin, distal step 2nd molar relation, and a narrow maxilla. This suggests a Class II malocclusion, which is characterized by a retrusive mandible. The decreased SNB angle also indicates a retrognathic mandible. The low FMA angle suggests a horizontal growth pattern. Given these factors, the child would benefit from an appliance that encourages forward growth of the mandible. The FR II appliance is designed to stimulate mandibular growth and correct Class II malocclusions, making it the most suitable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
