    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that influence the mesial and distal wall of a class V cavity. Class V cavities are located in the gingival third of the facial or lingual surfaces of the tooth. The direction of enamel rods, presence of carious lesion, contour of gingiva, and location of contact area could all potentially influence the formation of a cavity. However, the mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity are determined by the location and extent of the carious lesion, not the direction of enamel rods, contour of gingiva, or location of contact area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
