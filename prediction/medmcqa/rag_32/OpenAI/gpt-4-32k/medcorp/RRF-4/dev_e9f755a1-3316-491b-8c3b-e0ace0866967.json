    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's complaint of sensitivity to chewing pressure after the insertion of a distal extension partial denture could be due to several reasons. However, the most probable reason would be improper occlusion. This is because improper occlusion can cause uneven distribution of forces during mastication, leading to discomfort and sensitivity. Abrasion of tooth by clasp could also cause sensitivity, but it is less likely to occur within such a short period of time after denture insertion. Wearing off the cement base and a passive retentive arm are also less likely to cause sensitivity to chewing pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
