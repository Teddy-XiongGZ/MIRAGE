    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several methods for diagnosing C. difficile infection. Document [3] mentions real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of toxin genes as an effective diagnostic method. Document [4] also mentions the use of PCR for diagnosing C. difficile infection. Document [11] mentions the use of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for glutamate dehydrogenase detection or NAATs for toxin gene detection, followed by a relatively sensitive toxin EIA. Document [21] mentions the detection of C. difficile toxins A or B in diarrheal stool specimens. Document [23] mentions the detection of C. difficile toxins in feces. Document [25] mentions stool culture or testing for the bacteria's DNA or toxins. Document [29] mentions toxin enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Nagler's reaction is not mentioned in any of the documents. Therefore, all options except D are mentioned as methods for diagnosing C. difficile infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
