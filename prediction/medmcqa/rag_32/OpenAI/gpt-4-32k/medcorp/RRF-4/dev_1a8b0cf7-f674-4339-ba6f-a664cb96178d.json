    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case of laryngeal carcinoma with involvement of the anterior commissure and right vocal cord, which has developed perichondritis of the thyroid cartilage. This suggests an advanced stage of the disease. Document [10] suggests that when there is evidence of cartilage invasion, the likelihood of tumor eradication by endoscopic or external vertical partial laryngectomy is highly unlikely. The document also suggests that total laryngectomy may remain the only treatment option for advanced or aggressive first time recurrence. Document [19] also supports the idea of total laryngectomy in cases of advanced disease. Therefore, the patient should first undergo laryngectomy and then post-operative radiotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
