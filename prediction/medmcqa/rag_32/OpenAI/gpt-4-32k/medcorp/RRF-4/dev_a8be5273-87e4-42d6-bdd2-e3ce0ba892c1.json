    "First, let's analyze each option: A. Capsule polysaccharide act as a virulent factor for the production of antibody - This statement is not clear, as it doesn't specify which vaccine it refers to. However, it is known that polysaccharides can act as antigens, stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies. B. Conjugate vaccine is not given in outbreaks - Document [9] states that the meningococcal B vaccine can be used during outbreaks, provided the outbreak strain is covered by the vaccine antigens. This suggests that conjugate vaccines can be used in outbreaks. C. Polysaccharide vaccine should be given to children below 2 years of age - Document [13] states that polysaccharide vaccines have low immunogenicity in children and should not be used for primary immunization in patients younger than 5 years. This contradicts the statement. D. Vaccine with polysaccharide B is immunogenic - Document [27] states that recent attempts to create a universal MenB vaccine have been thwarted by the variability of the surface proteins of MenB and by the similarity of the MenB capsule to human glycoproteins. This suggests that a polysaccharide B vaccine may not be immunogenic. Based on the analysis, the most accurate statement seems to be option D. So, the output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I analyzed each option based on the information provided in the documents. Option A is unclear, option B is contradicted by document [9], option C is contradicted by document [13], and option D is supported by document [27]. Therefore, option D seems to be the most accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
