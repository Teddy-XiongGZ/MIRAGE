    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluorosis is caused by a higher than normal amount of fluoride ingestion while teeth are forming. This is mentioned in Document 3. Deciduous teeth, also known as primary or baby teeth, develop during the embryonic stage and erupt during infancy as stated in Document 28. Document 7 mentions that fluoride passes from the mother to fetal teeth and is taken up in secretory enamel, probably by the forming mineral apatite crystals. However, the degree of fluorosis of the deciduous dentition is less compared with that of the permanent dentition, due probably to a partial protection afforded by the maternal loss of fluoride, formerly known as the 'placental barrier'. This suggests that the placenta acts as a barrier, reducing the amount of fluoride that reaches the developing deciduous teeth. Therefore, option A is correct. However, the documents do not provide information to support options B and C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
