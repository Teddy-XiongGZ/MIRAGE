    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a true statement about the influenza vaccine. Option A is about the secondary attack rate, but none of the documents provided information about this. Option B is about virus shedding before symptoms appear, but again, the documents don't provide information about this in relation to the influenza vaccine. Option C suggests that 1 to 5 years is a high-risk age group, but the documents indicate that the vaccine is recommended for all individuals aged six months and older, not specifically 1 to 5 years as a high-risk group. Option D states that aquatic birds are reservoirs. While this statement is true in the context of influenza viruses in general, it doesn't specifically relate to the influenza vaccine. Therefore, none of the options seem to be directly supported by the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
