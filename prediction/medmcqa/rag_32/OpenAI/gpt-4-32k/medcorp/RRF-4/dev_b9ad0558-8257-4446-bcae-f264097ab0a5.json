    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with multiple rib injuries, is conscious but speaking single words, has a high respiratory rate and low blood pressure. These signs suggest that the patient is in respiratory distress and hypotensive, likely due to the chest trauma. Document [30] suggests that intubation may be necessary for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. The patient's high respiratory rate and difficulty speaking full sentences suggest inadequate breathing, and the low blood pressure could be a sign of shock due to the trauma. Therefore, the immediate step in management should be to secure the patient's airway and ensure adequate oxygenation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
