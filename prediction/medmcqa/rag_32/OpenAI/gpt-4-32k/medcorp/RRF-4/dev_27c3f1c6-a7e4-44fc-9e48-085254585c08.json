    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the hormone that has the maximum effect on granulation wound healing. Granulation tissue formation is a key part of the wound healing process. From the documents, it is clear that growth hormone has a significant effect on granulation tissue formation and wound healing (as seen in documents 0, 1, 2, 4, 13, 15, 24, 27). However, growth hormone is not one of the answer choices. Among the given options, thyroxine is mentioned in document 13 in relation to growth hormone, but there is no direct evidence of its effect on wound healing. Cortisone is not mentioned in any of the documents. Parathormone and epinephrine are also not mentioned in the context of wound healing. Therefore, based on the provided documents and choices, it is not possible to definitively choose an answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
