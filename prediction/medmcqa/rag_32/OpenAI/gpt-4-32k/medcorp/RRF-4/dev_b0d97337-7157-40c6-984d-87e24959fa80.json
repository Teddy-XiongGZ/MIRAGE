    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Child-Pugh score categorizes patients into three distinct groups based on their score range. This type of scale is not nominal because it does not simply name or label variables without any quantitative value. It is not continuous because it does not allow for an infinite number of possible values within a range. It is not purely quantitative because while it does involve numbers, it does not measure the quantity but rather the order or rank. Therefore, it is an ordinal scale because it categorizes data into distinct groups that have a specific order or ranking.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
