    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Brain death is defined as the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem. This means that there should be no signs of brain activity or reflexes. Normal BP without pharmacological support (Choice A) could still be present in a brain-dead patient because it is a function of the cardiovascular system, not the brain. Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation (Choice B) could also be present in a brain-dead patient because these are mediated by the spinal cord, not the brain. Sweating and tachycardia (Choice C) could also be present in a brain-dead patient because these are functions of the autonomic nervous system, not the brain. However, decorticate and decerebrate posturing (Choice D) are signs of severe brain damage, but not brain death. These postures are abnormal flexor and extensor responses to painful stimuli, respectively, and indicate that there is still some brain function present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
