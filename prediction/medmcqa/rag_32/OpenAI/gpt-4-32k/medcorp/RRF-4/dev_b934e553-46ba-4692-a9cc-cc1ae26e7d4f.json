    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total amount of drug in the solution. We have 2 ampules, each containing 200 mg of the drug, so we have a total of 400 mg of the drug. This is mixed in a 250 mL solution, so the concentration of the drug in the solution is 400 mg/250 mL = 1.6 mg/mL. The patient's weight is 80 kg and the dose is 10 mcg/kg/min, so the total dose per minute is 80 kg * 10 mcg/kg = 800 mcg/min. Since 1 mg = 1000 mcg, this is equivalent to 0.8 mg/min. To find out how many mL of the solution we need to deliver per minute, we divide the dose in mg by the concentration in mg/mL: 0.8 mg/min / 1.6 mg/mL = 0.5 mL/min. Since 16 drops = 1 mL, we need to deliver 0.5 mL/min * 16 drops/mL = 8 drops/min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
