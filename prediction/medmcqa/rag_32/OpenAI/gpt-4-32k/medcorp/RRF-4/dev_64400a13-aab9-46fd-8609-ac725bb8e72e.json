    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal (kidney) glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time. An increase in renal blood flow would likely increase the GFR as more blood is available to be filtered. Similarly, constriction of the efferent arteriole would increase pressure in the glomerulus, potentially increasing the GFR. A decrease in oncotic pressure would reduce the reabsorption of fluid in the renal tubules, potentially increasing the GFR. However, a renal stone in the ureter would obstruct the flow of urine, potentially causing a backflow pressure that could decrease the GFR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
