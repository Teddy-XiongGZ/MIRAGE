    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Xerostomia is a condition characterized by dry mouth due to reduced or absent saliva flow. Document [3] mentions that xerostomia can lead to rampant caries. This is because saliva plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health, including neutralizing acids produced by bacteria and providing minerals that help repair early stages of tooth decay. Therefore, a lack of saliva (xerostomia) can increase the risk of caries. The other options, such as fissured tongue, hairy tongue, and watery saliva, are not mentioned in the documents as factors that increase caries activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
