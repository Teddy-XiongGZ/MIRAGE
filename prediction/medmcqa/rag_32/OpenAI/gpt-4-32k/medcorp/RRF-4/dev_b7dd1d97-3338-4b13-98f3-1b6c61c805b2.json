    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking which statement about Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) is false. Step 2: Review each answer choice in relation to the documents provided. A. Develops within 24 hours - Document [5] states that TRALI is defined as new acute lung injury occurring during or within 6 hours after a transfusion. This suggests that the statement is false as TRALI develops within 6 hours, not 24. B. Mostly seen after sepsis and cardiac surgeries - Document [22] mentions that transfusion and acute lung injury are strongly related in virtually all clinical settings, including sepsis and cardiac surgeries. This suggests that the statement is true. C. It's a cause of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema - Document [3] states that TRALI is characterized by the sudden development of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. This suggests that the statement is true. D. Plasma is more likely to cause it than whole blood - Document [3] also mentions that although all blood products have been implicated, most reported cases were associated with fresh frozen plasma, red blood cell, and platelet transfusions. This suggests that the statement is true. Step 3: Choose the answer that is false based on the documents provided. Based on the documents, the false statement about TRALI is that it develops within 24 hours. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each answer choice in relation to the documents provided. Based on the documents, the false statement about TRALI is that it develops within 24 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
