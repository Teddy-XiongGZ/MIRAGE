    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the immunization schedule for a 13-month-old child who has not been immunized yet. According to Document [0], the vaccination schedule is broken down by age, and childhood immunizations are key in preventing diseases. Document [2] provides information about the HepB vaccine, but it doesn't mention the other vaccines. Document [8] provides a list of vaccines that should be completed before the child is 12 months of age, including BCG, DPT, OPV, HB, and measles vaccines. Document [9] mentions that the third dose of OPV is recommended at 6 months of age and the first dose of MMR vaccine at 12 to 15 months. Therefore, for a 13-month-old child, the vaccines that should be administered according to the schedule are OPV (3 doses), IPV (3 doses), Pentavalent (3 doses), and measles (1 dose).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
