    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that cholesterol crystals in apical periodontitis lesions are formed from the accumulation of cholesterol in inflamed periapical tissues (Document 0). This accumulation is suggested to be due to the inability of body cells, such as macrophages, to eliminate the local accumulation of cholesterol crystals (Document 1). The documents do not provide evidence that cholesterol crystals are formed from disintegrating erythrocytes of stagnant blood vessels within the lesion or from circulating plasma lipids. Therefore, the answer is likely to be that cholesterol crystals are formed from lymphocyte, plasma cells, macrophages that die and disintegrate in chronic apical lesion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
