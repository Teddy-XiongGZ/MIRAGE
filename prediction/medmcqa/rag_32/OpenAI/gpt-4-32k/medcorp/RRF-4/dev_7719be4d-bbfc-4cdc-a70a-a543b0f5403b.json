    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RVG stands for RadioVisioGraphy, a digital imaging system used in dentistry. Document [23] mentions that RVG actually generated greater radiation exposure than standard radiography, contradicting the statement in option A about 80% reduction of patient exposure. Document [25] mentions that RVG images were more accurate than D-speed film, which could imply that the image is sharper (option D). Instant imaging (option B) is a known advantage of digital imaging systems like RVG. Easy storage and retrieval (option C) is also a known advantage of digital systems as they allow for digital archiving.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
