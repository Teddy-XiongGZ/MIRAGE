    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the dental pulp plays an active role in the resorption of roots of primary teeth. Document [0] mentions that root resorption is a physiological event for primary teeth and is regulated by the dental follicle of the underlying permanent tooth. Document [4] suggests that the pulp of primary tooth plays an important role in the root resorption of primary tooth without permanent tooth germ. Document [5] also suggests that the dental pulp of primary molars may play an important role in root resorption in primary molars without permanent tooth germs. Therefore, the dental pulp does not play a passive role, nor does it become a fibrotic non-vital mass. It also does not aid in the formation of secondary dentin slowing down resorption. The most accurate answer is that the dental pulp initiates resorption from the inner surface of roots.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
