    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking which statement about cast cobalt alloys is NOT true. Step 2: Review each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the documents. A. They have a modulus of elasticity twice that of gold alloys. - Document 3 mentions that cobalt-base alloys have high strength even at elevated temperature, but it does not provide specific information about the modulus of elasticity in comparison to gold alloys. B. They are more rigid than gold alloys. - Document 3 also mentions that cobalt-base alloys are wear, corrosion and heat-resistant, which could imply higher rigidity, but it does not directly compare the rigidity to gold alloys. C. They have higher ductility than gold alloys. - Document 5 mentions that cobalt-chromium alloys show a low percent of elongation, which would suggest lower ductility, not higher. D. They have a lower proportional limit than gold alloys. - None of the documents provide specific information about the proportional limit of cobalt alloys in comparison to gold alloys. Step 3: Based on the information provided in the documents, the statement that is NOT true about cast cobalt alloys is that they have higher ductility than gold alloys. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about cast cobalt alloys is NOT true. After reviewing each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the documents, it appears that the statement that is NOT true is that cast cobalt alloys have higher ductility than gold alloys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
