    "First, let's understand the features of Tricuspid Atresia from the documents: 1. Document [24] states that Tricuspid Atresia is a form of congenital heart disease where there is a complete absence of the tricuspid valve, leading to an absence of right atrioventricular connection. This leads to a hypoplastic (undersized) or absent right ventricle. 2. Document [3] mentions that Tricuspid Atresia is associated with symptoms of cyanosis and/or congestive heart failure within a few days to 2 months after birth. 3. Document [2] explains that Tricuspid Atresia can be due to either an imperforate atrioventricular valve membrane or to absence of the right atrioventricular connexion. 4. Document [23] mentions that Tricuspid Atresia is the third most common cyanotic cardiac malformation. From these documents, we can infer that Tricuspid Atresia is characterized by the absence of the tricuspid valve, leading to a hypoplastic or absent right ventricle (Choice B). It is also associated with cyanosis and congestive heart failure, which could lead to diminished pulmonary vascularity (Choice C). However, the documents do not mention anything about a Left Axis deviation (Choice A) or Splitting of S2 (Choice D) being characteristic features of Tricuspid Atresia. To choose between these two options, we need to understand what they mean: - Left Axis deviation is a condition where the electrical axis of the heart lies in a direction between -30 and -90 degrees. This is often associated with conditions that cause hypertrophy or enlargement of the left ventricle, such as high blood pressure or aortic valve disease. - Splitting of S2 refers to the splitting of the second heart sound (S2) into two distinct sounds. This is normally heard during inspiration due to the delay in closure of the pulmonic valve compared to the aortic valve. Given that Tricuspid Atresia is associated with a hypoplastic or absent right ventricle, it is unlikely to cause Left Axis deviation, which is associated with conditions that cause hypertrophy or enlargement of the left ventricle. On the other hand, Splitting of S2 is a normal physiological phenomenon that occurs due to the delay in closure of the pulmonic valve compared to the aortic valve during inspiration. Given that Tricuspid Atresia involves the absence of the tricuspid valve, it is plausible that this could affect the normal timing of valve closure and potentially lead to abnormal splitting of S2. Therefore, the most likely answer is Choice A: Left Axis deviation.
