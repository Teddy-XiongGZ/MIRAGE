    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An epidemic refers to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in the population in that area. An outbreak carries the same definition of epidemic, but is often used for a more limited geographic area. Sporadic refers to a disease that occurs infrequently and irregularly. Endemic refers to the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area. In this case, the healthy center reports 40 to 50 cases in a week in the community, and this week there are 48 cases, which is within the normal range. Therefore, this is not an epidemic, outbreak, or sporadic event, but rather an endemic situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
