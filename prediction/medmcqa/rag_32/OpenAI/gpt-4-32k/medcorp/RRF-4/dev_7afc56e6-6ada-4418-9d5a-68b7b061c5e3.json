    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aspirin's effects on the brain are mentioned in several documents. Document [0] mentions that the analgesic effects of aspirin are found in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices and anterior parts of the anterior cingulate cortex. Document [2] also suggests that aspirin may act centrally in pain processing. Document [4] mentions that aspirin is neuroprotective by inhibiting glutamate release in brain ischaemia. Document [21] mentions that aspirin increases NMDA receptor subunit 2A concentrations in the rat hippocampus. All these areas are part of the cerebral cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain. Therefore, the answer is 'Cortex'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
