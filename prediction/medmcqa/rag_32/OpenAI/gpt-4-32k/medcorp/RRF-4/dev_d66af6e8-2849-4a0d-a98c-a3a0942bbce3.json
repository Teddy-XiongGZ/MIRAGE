    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cyanotic spell in a patient with Tetralogy of Fallot is a sudden increase in cyanosis, often triggered by events such as crying. This is due to an increase in the right to left shunt, leading to decreased oxygenation of the blood. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is often used to treat these spells as it can help to decrease the heart rate and reduce the severity of the spells. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, can be used to increase systemic vascular resistance, helping to decrease the right to left shunt. Sodium bicarbonate can be used to correct metabolic acidosis that may occur during a spell. Isoprenaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, can increase heart rate and contractility, potentially worsening the right to left shunt and therefore the cyanosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Isoprenaline\"}"
