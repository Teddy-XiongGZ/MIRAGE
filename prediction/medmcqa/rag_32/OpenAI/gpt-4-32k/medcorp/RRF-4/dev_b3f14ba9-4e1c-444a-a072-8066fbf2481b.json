    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information in the documents about which type of cells are most increased in number in the connective tissue wall of a periodontal pocket. Document [24] states that large amounts of IL-1beta are present in inflamed gingival tissues, and that both macrophages and neutrophils are predominate in IL-1beta production in inflamed gingival tissues. However, this does not directly answer the question. Document [30] states that plasma cells were more abundant in a layer deep to the neutrophils lining the basement membrane and were also more abundant in areas of extensive histological inflammation. This suggests that plasma cells might be the most increased in number in the connective tissue wall of a periodontal pocket.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
