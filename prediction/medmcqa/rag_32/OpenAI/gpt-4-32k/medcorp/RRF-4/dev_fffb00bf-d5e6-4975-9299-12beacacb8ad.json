Document [0] mentions the use of an esophagogram and endoscopy for diagnosis. Document [1] also mentions the use of bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy. Document [2] mentions the use of an upper gastrointestinal contrast study/tube esophagogram, chest radiograph, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy. Document [3] mentions the use of iodine oil examination of the esophagus, fiberoptic bronchoscopy combined with esophagoscopy, and 3-D CT reconstruction of the trachea and esophagus. Document [4] emphasizes the complementary diagnostic roles of contrast esophagogram and rigid open-tube endoscopy. Document [6] mentions the use of esophagogram and preoperative bronchoscopy. Document [12] mentions the use of videofluoroscopy. Document [15] mentions the use of endoscopy and guide wire placement. Document [16] mentions the use of esophagography and/or fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Document [24] mentions the use of three-dimensional computed tomography and virtual bronchoscopy. Document [28] mentions the use of three-dimensional computed tomography and virtual bronchoscopy. Document [30] mentions the use of flexible laryngotracheal endoscopy and rigid tracheoscopy. From these documents, it is clear that while multiple methods can be used, bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy are commonly used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Tracheo-bronchoscopy\"}"
