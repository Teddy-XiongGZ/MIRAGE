    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking which statement about the calculation of the Human Development Index (HDI) is not true. Step 2: Review the answer choices. The choices are about the weightage given to adult literacy and gross enrollment in the calculation of HDI, and whether only secondary education is considered in gross enrollment. Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [0], [1], [6], [10], [20], and [26] provide information about the calculation of HDI. Step 4: Compare the information in the documents with the answer choices. According to Document [10], the HDI combined three dimensions last used in its 2009 report: Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity to HDI; Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting); Standard of living, as indicated by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity. Step 5: Determine the correct answer. Based on the information in Document [10], Choice A is incorrect because not only secondary education but also primary and tertiary education are considered in gross enrollment. The other choices are consistent with the information in the document. Step 6: Formulate the answer in the required format. The answer is Choice A. The final output in json format is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about the calculation of the Human Development Index (HDI) is not true. After reviewing the relevant documents, it is clear that not only secondary education but also primary and tertiary education are considered in gross enrollment. Therefore, the statement that only secondary education is considered in gross enrollment is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
