    "First, I need to understand what the terms in the choices mean. Tritubercular teeth have three cusps or bumps on the chewing surface. Quadritubercular teeth have four cusps. Haplodont refers to teeth with a single cusp, and Triconodont refers to teeth with three cusps in a row. Next, I need to find information about the number of cusps on a mandibular molar. From Document [0], I learned that mandibular first molars usually have five well-developed cusps. Document [1] states that mandibular second molars usually have four cusps. Based on this information, mandibular molars do not fit the description of any of the choices exactly. However, since the second molar has four cusps, the closest match would be quadritubercular teeth. So, my answer is B. Quadritubercular teeth. Here is the output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I defined the terms in the choices. Then, I found information about the number of cusps on mandibular molars. Based on this information, the closest match is quadritubercular teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
