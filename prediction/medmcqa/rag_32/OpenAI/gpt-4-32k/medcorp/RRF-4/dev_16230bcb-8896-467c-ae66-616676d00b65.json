According to Document [0], the second mesiobuccal canal was detected in 50.9% of the permanent maxillary first molars that were studied. However, this was with the use of magnification loupes. Document [1] states that 30% of all maxillary molars had a negotiable second mesiobuccal canal. Document [2] suggests that the use of a dental operating microscope can increase the detection rate of the second mesiobuccal canal. Document [15] states that with naked eye, the second mesiobuccal canal was located in 25% of the teeth. Therefore, the percentage of cases where the second mesiobuccal canal can be seen with the naked eye is closest to 30%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 30%\"}"
