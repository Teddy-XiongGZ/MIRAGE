    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by a decrease in iron stores in the body. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron, so when iron levels are low, ferritin levels also decrease as indicated in Document 0. Serum iron, which is the measure of iron in the blood, also decreases in iron deficiency anemia as stated in Document 2. Transferrin saturation, which is a measure of the amount of iron bound to transferrin (the protein that carries iron in the blood), decreases when there is less iron available to bind as mentioned in Document 0. However, TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity) which measures the blood's capacity to bind iron with transferrin, increases in iron deficiency anemia. This is because when iron levels are low, the body produces more transferrin to maximize iron transport, thus increasing the TIBC as stated in Document 2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. TIBC\"}"
