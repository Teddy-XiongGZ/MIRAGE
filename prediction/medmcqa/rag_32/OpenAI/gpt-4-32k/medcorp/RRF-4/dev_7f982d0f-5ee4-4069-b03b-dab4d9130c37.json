Step 2: Review the documents and find relevant information. Document [0] states that Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of the genes on chromosome 21, which is known as trisomy 21. Document [14] mentions that mosaic Down syndrome can occur when some of the cells in the body have trisomy 21. Document [13] mentions that Down syndrome can also be caused by a Robertsonian translocation, where a part of chromosome 21 is located on another chromosome. Step 3: Compare the information from the documents with the answer choices. Choices A, B, and C are all mentioned in the documents as causes of Down syndrome. However, there is no mention of deletion of chromosome 21 as a cause of Down syndrome in any of the documents. Step 4: Choose the answer that is not mentioned in the documents as a cause of Down syndrome. Based on these steps, the answer is D. Deletion of 21. The JSON output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the one option that is not a cause of Down syndrome. After reviewing the documents, I found that trisomy 21, mosaicism of 21 chromosome, and Robertsonian translocation of 21.21, 21.18 are all causes of Down syndrome. However, there is no mention of deletion of chromosome 21 as a cause of Down syndrome in any of the documents. Therefore, the answer is D. Deletion of 21.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
