    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The flow of blood in a vessel is governed by Poiseuille's law, which states that the flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. Therefore, if the radius of the blood vessel is increased by 50%, the flow rate would increase by (1.5)^4 = 5.0625 times. However, since the options are all integers, we can round this to the nearest whole number.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
