    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] clearly mentions that the hidden X suture technique was investigated for its impact on alveolar ridge preservation (ARP). The study provided clinical and radiographic verification of the efficacy of the hidden X suture in preserving the width of keratinized tissue and the dimensions of the alveolar ridge after ARP. Therefore, the hidden X suture proves to be a novel suturing technique for alveolar ridge preservation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
