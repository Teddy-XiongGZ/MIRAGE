    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucogenic substances are those that can be converted into glucose through the process of gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and lactate are all substances that can be converted into glucose, as mentioned in various documents. However, acetyl-CoA, derived from the oxidation of fatty acids, cannot produce a net yield of glucose via the citric acid cycle, as stated in Document [6]. Therefore, acetyl-CoA is not glucogenic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Acetyl-CoA\"}"
