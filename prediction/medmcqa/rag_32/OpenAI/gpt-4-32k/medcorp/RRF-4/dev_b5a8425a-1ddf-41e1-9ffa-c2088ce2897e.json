    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ligand for receptors present in liver for uptake of LDL is the protein that binds to the LDL receptor and triggers its uptake. According to Document [22], the apolipoprotein B portion of LDL cholesterol binds to the LDL receptor on the liver cells, triggering its uptake and digestion. This process results in the removal of LDL from the circulatory system. Document [17] also mentions that the binding of chylomicron remnants to liver cell membranes is not dependent on the LDL receptor, but their intact uptake by hepatocytes is. This suggests that the ligand for the LDL receptor in the liver is Apo B-100.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Apo B-100\"}"
