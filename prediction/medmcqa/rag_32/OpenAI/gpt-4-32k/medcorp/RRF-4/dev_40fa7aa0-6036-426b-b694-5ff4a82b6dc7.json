    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Gillies approach is mentioned in several documents. Document [0] mentions that the Gillies approach is used for treating zygomatic arch fractures. Document [6] also mentions the Gillies temporal approach for fractures of the zygoma. Document [15] and [17] also mention the Gillies approach in the context of zygomatic fractures. Therefore, the Gillies approach is used in the treatment of zygomatic fractures. Now, we need to determine whether it's used for open or closed reduction. Document [0] describes it as a minimally invasive approach, which suggests it's used for closed reduction. Document [20] also compares the Gillies method with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), suggesting that the Gillies method is not an open reduction technique. Therefore, the Gillies approach is used for closed reduction of zygomatic fractures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Closed reduction of zygomatic fracture\"}"
