    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"3rd nerve palsy, also known as oculomotor nerve palsy, can cause a variety of symptoms due to its role in controlling most of the eye's movements, as well as pupil constriction and eyelid opening. Pupil dilation (A) can occur in 3rd nerve palsy because the parasympathetic fibers running along the nerve, which normally constrict the pupil, can be affected, leading to unopposed action of the sympathetic system, which dilates the pupil. Ptosis (B), or drooping of the upper eyelid, can also occur in 3rd nerve palsy because the nerve supplies the muscle that lifts the eyelid. Outward upward rolling of the pupil (C) can occur because the 3rd nerve supplies four of the six muscles that move the eye, and its palsy can lead to unopposed action of the remaining muscles, leading to abnormal eye movements. However, impaired pupillary reflex (D) is not typically seen in 3rd nerve palsy. The pupillary light reflex, which causes the pupil to constrict in response to light, is mediated by the 2nd (optic) and 3rd (oculomotor) cranial nerves. In 3rd nerve palsy, while the pupil may be dilated, the reflex can still be present if the parasympathetic fibers of the nerve are spared.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
