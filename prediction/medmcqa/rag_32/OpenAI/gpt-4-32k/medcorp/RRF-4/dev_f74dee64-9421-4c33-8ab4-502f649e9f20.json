    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the differences between primary and secondary teeth roots. From Document [0], I learned that the roots of primary molar teeth are narrow and slender. Document [6] explains that the roots of primary teeth are absorbed by the forming permanent teeth, which suggests that primary roots resorb more easily. Document [13] mentions that the roots of primary teeth are usually shorter than those of permanent teeth. Therefore, the answer should be that primary roots resorb more easily and are shorter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Primary roots resorb more easily\"}"
