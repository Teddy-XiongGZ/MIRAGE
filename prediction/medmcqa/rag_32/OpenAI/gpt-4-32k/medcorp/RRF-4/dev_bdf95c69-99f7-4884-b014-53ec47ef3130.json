    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RNAi, or RNA interference, is a biological process that involves the suppression of gene expression. According to Document [1], RNAi is often used in experimental biology to study the function of genes. It works by introducing double-stranded RNA with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest into a cell or organism. This causes a drastic decrease in the expression of the targeted gene. However, it's important to note that RNAi may not completely eliminate the expression of the gene. This is why the technique is sometimes referred to as a 'knockdown', to distinguish it from 'knockout' procedures where the expression of a gene is completely eliminated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Knock down\"}"
