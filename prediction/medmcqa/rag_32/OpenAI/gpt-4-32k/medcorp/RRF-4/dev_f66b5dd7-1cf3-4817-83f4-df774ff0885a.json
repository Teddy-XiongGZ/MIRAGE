    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that thumb sucking can lead to skeletal Class II malocclusion, anterior open bite, and excessive overjet. These conditions are often associated with changes in facial height. Specifically, an anterior open bite is often associated with an increased anterior facial height due to the excessive eruption of the posterior teeth. Therefore, it is likely that Lalloo's cephalogram would show an increased anterior facial height. There is no information suggesting that thumb sucking would lead to an increased posterior facial height.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increased anterior facial height and normal posterior facial height\"}"
