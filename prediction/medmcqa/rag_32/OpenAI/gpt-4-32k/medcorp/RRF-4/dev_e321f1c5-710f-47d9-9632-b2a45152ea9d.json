    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that CT scans can detect nodal metastases based on certain characteristics such as size, shape, and the presence of necrosis. However, they also mention that small, clinically occult, melanoma metastases are frequently overlooked on CT scans. This suggests that size could be a factor in whether a metastasis is detected. However, the specific size mentioned in the options, 'more than 6 mm', is not directly addressed in the documents. The shape of the node (rounded or spiculated) is not mentioned as a factor affecting the visibility of metastases on CT scans. Necrotic nodes are mentioned as being detectable on CT scans, so they would not be 'not seen'. Therefore, by process of elimination, the answer would be 'Size more than 6 mm'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
