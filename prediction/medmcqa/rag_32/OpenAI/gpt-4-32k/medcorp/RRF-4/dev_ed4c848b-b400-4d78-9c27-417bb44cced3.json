    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find the document that mentions the highest incidence of atypical root canal or root among all teeth. Document [5] mentions that the root presenting with the highest percentage of missed canals (62.8%) was the mesiobuccal root of the maxillary first molar. However, this is not among the answer choices. Document [6] mentions that first molars and second premolars were the most frequently root-filled teeth in both jaws, but it does not specify if these are mandibular or maxillary teeth. Document [27] mentions that the most common anatomic variation was C-shaped canals in mandibular first premolars with the highest incidence in Mongoloid populations (up to 24%). However, this is not among the answer choices. Document [28] mentions that the majority of mandibular first and second premolar teeth had a single root with a type I canal system. However, this does not specify the incidence of atypical root canal or root. Therefore, based on the available documents, I cannot definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
