    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by a decrease in iron reserves and circulating iron. This is reflected in the laboratory findings. Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) is usually high in iron deficiency anemia because the body tries to increase its capacity to bind more iron. Ferritin, which is a measure of iron stores in the body, is usually low in iron deficiency anemia because the body's iron stores are depleted. Transferrin saturation, which is a measure of the amount of iron bound to transferrin, is usually low in iron deficiency anemia because there is less iron available to bind to transferrin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. High TIBC, Low Ferritin, Low Transferrin saturation\"}"
