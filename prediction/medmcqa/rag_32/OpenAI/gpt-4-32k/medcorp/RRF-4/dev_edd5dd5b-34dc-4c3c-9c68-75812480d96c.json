    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what occlusal interferences are. From the documents, I understand that occlusal interferences are problems that interfere with the normal path of the bite, usually due to the position or shape of a single tooth or group of teeth. Next, I need to find information about the relationship between occlusal interferences and certain habits. Document [1] and Document [18] suggest a relationship between occlusal interferences and bruxism, which is a habit of involuntary grinding or clenching of the teeth. However, I don't see any information in the documents that suggests a relationship between occlusal interferences and thumb sucking or tongue thrusting. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that occlusal interferences with nervous tension triggers bruxism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
