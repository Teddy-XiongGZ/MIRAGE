    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about high-risk infants, not high-risk pregnancies. While antenatal preeclampsia is a high-risk pregnancy condition, it does not necessarily mean the infant will be high risk. A working mother or being a third child does not inherently make an infant high risk. However, being a twin can be considered a high-risk condition for an infant due to potential complications such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
