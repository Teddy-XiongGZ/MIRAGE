    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a gastrointestinal emergency that primarily affects premature infants. The disease is typically staged using Bell's Staging Criteria. Stage I NEC is suspected disease with mild symptoms such as lethargy, apnea, or bradycardia. Stage II NEC is definite disease, further divided into Stage IIa (mildly ill) and Stage IIb (moderately ill). Stage III NEC is advanced disease, further divided into Stage IIIa (severely ill) and Stage IIIb (very severely ill, often requiring surgery). The presence of pneumatosis intestinalis, which is gas in the bowel wall, is a hallmark of NEC and is typically seen in Stage II and III. Since the baby in the question has pneumatosis intestinalis but no other symptoms or signs are mentioned, it is likely that the baby is in Stage IIa, which is characterized by pneumatosis intestinalis and systemic signs of illness but without metabolic acidosis or other severe laboratory abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
