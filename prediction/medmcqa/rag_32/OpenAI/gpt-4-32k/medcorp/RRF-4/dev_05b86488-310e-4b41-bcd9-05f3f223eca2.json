    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several factors that can affect the prognosis of prosthodontic procedures. Document [0] mentions several prosthodontics-related risk factors including implant-connection, loading protocol, transmucosal abutments, prosthetic fit, provisionalization, type of retention, impression technique, fabrication technique, and occlusion. Among these, occlusion is mentioned as a choice in the question. Document [2] also mentions that prosthetic changes in dental occlusion are not yet acceptable as strategies for solving TMD symptoms or helping an individual stop bruxism. Document [16] also mentions that the survival rate of implants and prostheses, impact on physiological and psychological status, oral health-related impact on quality of life, and initial and maintenance costs are treatment outcomes in implant prosthodontics. However, among these, only occlusion is mentioned as a choice in the question. Therefore, occlusion seems to be the main concern during prosthodontics surgery and better prosthetic prognosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Occlusion\"}"
