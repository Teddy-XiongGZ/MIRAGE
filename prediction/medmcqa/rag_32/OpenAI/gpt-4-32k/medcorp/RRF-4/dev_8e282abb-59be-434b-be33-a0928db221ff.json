    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a tertiary monoblock system of obturation of the root canal. From Document [1], it is mentioned that a tertiary monoblock is created with EndoREZ, bondable glass-fibre post, and silane-coated ceramic post. However, none of these options are provided in the answer choices. Therefore, I need to look for the closest match. Resilon is mentioned in Document [22] as a material that has been investigated as an alternative to traditional gutta-percha for root canal obturation, and it is suggested that it may provide a better seal. This suggests that Resilon could be used in a monoblock system, although the document does not specifically state that it is used in a tertiary monoblock system. The other options, Active Gutta percha, Orthograde obturation with MTA, and Gutta Percha and AH plus sealer, are not mentioned in the context of a monoblock system in any of the documents. Therefore, the closest match to the answer would be Resilon monoblock obturation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
