    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a significantly high blood pressure reading of 170/120, which is considered a hypertensive crisis. According to Document [16], a hypertensive emergency is a medical condition with severe hypertension that involves acute and rapidly progressed target cardiovascular organ damage. This situation requires immediate blood pressure reduction to prevent lethal target-organ damage. However, the document also mentions that the treatment of a hypertensive urgency, which does not accompany any evidence of target-organ damages, can be treated with oral antihypertensives agents. In this case, it is not clear whether the patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency or urgency. However, given the high blood pressure reading, it would be safest to refer the patient back to their physician for immediate evaluation and treatment before proceeding with the oral prophylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
