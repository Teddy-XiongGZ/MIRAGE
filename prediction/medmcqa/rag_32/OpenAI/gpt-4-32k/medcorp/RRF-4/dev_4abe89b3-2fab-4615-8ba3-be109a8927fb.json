    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tooth in the mandibular arch that is most likely to be displaced due to arch size discrepancy. From the documents, it is clear that the most common cause of tooth displacement is inadequate arch length and space in which to erupt. This is often due to a discrepancy between the total length of the alveolar arch and the tooth arch. The documents also mention that the wisdom teeth (third molars) are frequently impacted because they are the last teeth to erupt in the oral cavity. However, the third molar is not one of the options given in the question. Among the options given, the first and second molars are more likely to be displaced due to arch size discrepancy as they are the last to erupt before the third molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. First molar\"}"
