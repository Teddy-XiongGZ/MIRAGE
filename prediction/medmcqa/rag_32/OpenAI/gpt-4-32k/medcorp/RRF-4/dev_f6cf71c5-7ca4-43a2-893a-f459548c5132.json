    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Odontoblasts are the cells responsible for dentin formation in teeth. When a cavity is prepared, some odontoblasts may be killed due to the procedure. According to Document [21], after tooth preparation, dental pulp stem/progenitor cells actively proliferate and differentiate into new odontoblast-like cells. This suggests that the new odontoblasts that replace the ones killed during cavity preparation are derived from undifferentiated cells in the dental pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
