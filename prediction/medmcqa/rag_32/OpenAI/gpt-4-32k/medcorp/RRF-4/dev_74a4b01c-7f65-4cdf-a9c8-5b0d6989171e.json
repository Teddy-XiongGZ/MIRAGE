    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [10] states that radiotherapy to the head and neck or to the pelvis or abdomen is associated with Grade 3 and Grade 4 oral or GI mucositis, often exceeding 50% of patients. Some reactions are immediate, while others may be later (e.g., months after treatment). Acute Acute radiodermatitis occurs when an 'erythema dose' of ionizing radiation is given to the skin, after which visible erythema appears up to 24 hours after. Radiation dermatitis generally manifests within a few weeks after the start of radiotherapy. Acute radiodermatitis, while presenting as red patches, may sometimes also present with desquamation or blistering. Erythema may occur at a dose of 2 Gy radiation or greater. This suggests that erythema is a common reaction to radiotherapy and can occur within a few weeks of treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
