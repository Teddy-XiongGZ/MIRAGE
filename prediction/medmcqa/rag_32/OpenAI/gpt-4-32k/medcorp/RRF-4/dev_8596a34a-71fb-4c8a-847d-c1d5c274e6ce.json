    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the weakest part of the pharynx. From the documents, Document [18] mentions a small triangular gap called the Killian dehiscence located in the laryngeal pharynx between the inferior constrictor and cricopharyngeus muscles. This area is described as a weak point where the pharyngeal mucosa and submucosa could get herniated and bulged between these two parts. This matches with option B 'Between thyropharyngeal and cricopharyngeal sphincter'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
