    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentinal fluid permeability is influenced by several factors. According to Document [28], temperature variation can affect dentinal fluid permeability. Document [22] mentions that pressure gradient across dentinal tubules can influence dentinal fluid permeability. Document [2] suggests that the viscosity of the dentinal fluid can affect its permeability. However, none of the documents suggest that the rate of removal of substances by blood vessels influences dentinal fluid permeability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
