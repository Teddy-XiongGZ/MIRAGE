    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of skin rash, hypotension, and difficulty in breathing after administration of ampicillin suggest an anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen. In such cases, adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is the first-line treatment. It works by reducing throat swelling, opening the airways, and maintaining heart function and blood pressure.

The concentration of adrenaline typically used for anaphylaxis is 1:1000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
