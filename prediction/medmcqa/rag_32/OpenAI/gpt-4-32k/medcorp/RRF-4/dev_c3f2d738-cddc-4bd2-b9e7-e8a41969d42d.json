    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide a clear definition of the shape of a rest seat. However, they do mention that rest seats can be prepared directly on the abutment teeth as grooves or shoulders, and that they can vary greatly in all planes, including the interocclusal clearance. They also mention that rest seats can be under-prepared or over-prepared, and that they can be prepared in the mesial marginal ridge. However, none of the documents mention a spoon shape, a hemisphere shape, an elliptical shape, or a rhomboid shape specifically.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
