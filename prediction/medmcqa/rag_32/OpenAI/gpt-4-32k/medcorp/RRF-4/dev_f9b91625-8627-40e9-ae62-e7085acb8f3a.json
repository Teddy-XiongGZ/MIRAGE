    "First, I will look for information about the thermal expansion of porcelain denture teeth compared to acrylic teeth. I didn't find any specific information about this in the documents. Next, I will look for information about the abrasion resistance of porcelain denture teeth compared to enamel. Document [7] suggests that porcelain teeth show considerably less wear than acrylic resin teeth, but it doesn't compare them to enamel. Then, I will look for information about the use of porcelain denture teeth where the inter alveolar clearance is small. I didn't find any specific information about this in the documents. Finally, I will look for information about the abrasion resistance of porcelain denture teeth compared to gold. Document [3] suggests that wear of both porcelain and modern cross-linked resin teeth was mainly a fatigue type of wear. Abrasion was observed when hard particles were assumed to be part of the wear debris. However, it doesn't compare them to gold. Based on the information available, the most accurate statement seems to be that porcelain denture teeth have a higher abrasion resistance than gold, as suggested by Document [3]. However, it's important to note that this is an inference based on the available information, and not a direct statement from the documents. Therefore, the answer is D. Porcelain denture teeth have a higher abrasion resistance than gold.
