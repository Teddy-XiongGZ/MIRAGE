    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best practice for getting a better cast when using addition silicones. Looking at the documents, Document [13] suggests that it is recommended to wait at least 30 minutes before pouring the cast to prevent a pitted cast. This is because a secondary reaction in addition silicones leads to hydrogen gas production, which can cause pitting in the cast if it is poured too soon. Therefore, delaying the pouring of the cast can lead to a better result.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
