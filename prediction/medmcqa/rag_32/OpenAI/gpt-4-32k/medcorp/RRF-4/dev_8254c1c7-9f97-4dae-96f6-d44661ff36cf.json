    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Shaping is a conditioning paradigm used primarily in the experimental analysis of behavior. The method used is differential reinforcement of successive approximations. It was introduced by B. F. Skinner with pigeons and extended to dogs, dolphins, humans and other species. In shaping, the form of an existing response is gradually changed across successive trials towards a desired target behavior by reinforcing exact segments of behavior. This is clearly explained in Document [0]. This method is based on the principles of operant conditioning, which involves reinforcement and punishment to shape behavior. This is not directly related to the stimulus-response theory, social learning principle, or hierarchy of needs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of the above.\"}"
