    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme. This means that the enzyme is saturated with the substrate and the reaction rate is at its maximum (Vmax), as per the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. When the enzyme concentration is reduced to 1/3, the maximum reaction rate will also be reduced to 1/3, because the reaction rate is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration. Doubling the substrate concentration will not affect the reaction rate because the enzyme is already saturated with the substrate. Therefore, it will take three times longer to convert the same amount of substrate into product.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 27 minutes\"}"
