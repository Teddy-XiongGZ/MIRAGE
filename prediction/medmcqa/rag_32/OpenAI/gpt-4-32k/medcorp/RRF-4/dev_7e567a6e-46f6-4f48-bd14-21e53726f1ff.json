    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amino acid replacement refers to the change from one amino acid to a different amino acid in a protein due to a point mutation in the corresponding DNA sequence. The effect of this replacement on the function or structure of the protein depends on how similar or dissimilar the replaced amino acids are. This is referred to as conservative replacement when an amino acid is exchanged into another that has similar properties, and radical replacement when an amino acid is exchanged into another with different properties. Glutamine and Asparagine are both polar and uncharged, making them similar and likely to result in a conservative replacement. Aspartate and Glutamate are also similar, both being negatively charged. Alanine and Tryptophan, however, are dissimilar, with Alanine being small and nonpolar and Tryptophan being large and aromatic, making this a likely radical replacement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of these\"}"
