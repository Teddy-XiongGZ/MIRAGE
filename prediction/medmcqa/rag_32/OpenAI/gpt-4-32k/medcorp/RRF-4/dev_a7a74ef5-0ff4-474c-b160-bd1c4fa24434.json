    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information in the documents about the best investigation method for metabolic disorders. Document [15] discusses various laboratory testing modalities for diagnosing inborn errors of metabolism, but it does not specify which one is the best. Document [31] mentions the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to determine gene mutations in metabolic myopathies, but it does not compare this method to others. However, Document [2] talks about the progress of laboratory investigation programmes and the use of an application form for metabolic investigation to collect clinical information relevant to metabolic disease. It does not mention any of the options provided in the question. Therefore, I need to rely on my medical knowledge. Tandem mass spectrometry is a powerful tool that is often used in newborn screening for a variety of metabolic disorders because it can detect multiple disorders in a single test. Therefore, I would choose this as the best investigation for metabolic disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
