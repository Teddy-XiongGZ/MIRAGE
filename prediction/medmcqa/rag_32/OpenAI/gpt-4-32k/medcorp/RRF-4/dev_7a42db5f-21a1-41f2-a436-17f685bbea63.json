    "Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the following: - Document [0] defines Onodi cells as the posterior-most ethmoid cell and Haller cells as infraorbital ethmoid cells. - Document [2] further explains that Onodi cells are lateral and posterior extensions of the posterior ethmoid cells and may surround the optic nerve tract. Haller cells are ethmoid air cells that extend laterally over the medial aspect of the roof of the maxillary sinus. From these definitions, we can conclude that Onodi cells are related to the optic nerve and Haller cells are related to the floor of the orbit. Therefore, the answer is: A. Optic nerve and floor of the orbit The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Onodi cells are defined as the posterior-most ethmoid cell and may surround the optic nerve tract. Haller cells are defined as infraorbital ethmoid cells, which means they are related to the floor of the orbit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
