    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vulcanization is a process that involves hardening rubbers. This process is generally irreversible and it works by forming cross-links between sections of polymer chain which results in increased rigidity and durability, as well as other changes in the mechanical and electrical properties of the material. None of the options provided directly refer to rubber, but Zinc oxide-eugenol is a material used in dentistry that undergoes a setting reaction and hardens, which is somewhat similar to the process of vulcanization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
