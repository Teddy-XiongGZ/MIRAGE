    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best incision for diaphragmatic surgery. From the documents, it is clear that the choice of incision depends on the specific situation and the surgeon's preference. However, Document [3] mentions that they prefer to use an upper abdominal midline incision for all cases of diaphragmatic hernia and eventration. Document [9] also mentions that a midline incision offers good access to the abdominal cavity and avoids severing major nerves, muscles, or vessels. Therefore, it seems that a midline incision might be the best choice for diaphragmatic surgery. However, none of the options provided in the question match this description. Therefore, I would need to choose the option that is closest to a midline incision. A vertical incision would be the closest to a midline incision.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
