    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium nitroprusside is a medication used to lower blood pressure. According to Document [0], the pharmacological activation of sodium nitroprusside is related to the release of nitric oxide, which serves to activate Sodium Guanylyl Cyclase. This is further supported by Document [3], which states that sodium nitroprusside breaks down in circulation to release nitric oxide (NO). NO activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle and increases intracellular production of cGMP. This results in vascular smooth muscle relaxation, which allows vessels to dilate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Guanylate cyclase\"}"
