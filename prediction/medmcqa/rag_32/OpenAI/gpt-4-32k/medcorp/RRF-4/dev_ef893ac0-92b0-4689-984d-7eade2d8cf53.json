    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several reasons for the fracture of porcelain fused to metal restorations. Document [18] mentions that the initial fit of these restorations can deteriorate during the firing cycle of porcelain, suggesting that an improper firing schedule could be a cause. Document [14] suggests that the design of the underlying metal structure can significantly affect the ultimate fracture strength of the restoration, indicating that an inadequately designed framework could be a cause. Document [9] mentions that occlusal forces can cause fractures, suggesting that occlusal trauma could be a cause. Document [14] also mentions that a metal conditioning agent does not decrease fracture resistance if applied properly, suggesting that failure to use a metal conditioner is not a primary cause of repeated fractures. Therefore, all of the options could potentially cause a fracture, but the question asks for the primary cause. Document [18] suggests that the most significant cause of repeated fractures is the distortion seen after porcelain application firing, which is significantly greater than that seen after metal-conditioning firing. This suggests that the primary cause of repeated fractures is an improper firing schedule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
