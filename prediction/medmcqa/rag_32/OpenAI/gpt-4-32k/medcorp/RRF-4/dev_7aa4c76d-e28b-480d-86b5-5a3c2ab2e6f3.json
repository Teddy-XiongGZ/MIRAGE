    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with instability of the knee joint in full extension, but not at 90 degrees of flexion. This suggests that the injury is likely to involve a structure that provides stability in extension. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a key stabilizer of the knee, particularly in preventing anterior translation of the tibia on the femur and in controlling rotation of the knee joint. The ACL is composed of two bundles, the anteromedial and posterolateral, named according to where the bundles insert into the tibial plateau. The anteromedial bundle is tight during flexion while the posterolateral bundle is tight during extension. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms, it is likely that the posterolateral bundle of the ACL is damaged.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
