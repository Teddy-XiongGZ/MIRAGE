    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that there are two types of pain sensations related to teeth: sharp pain and dull pain. Sharp pain is typically associated with dentinal stimulation of teeth with healthy pulps. This sharp pain is mediated by A delta fibers, as mentioned in Document 0, Document 6, Document 15, Document 25, and Document 31. On the other hand, C fibers are associated with dull pain induced by intense thermal stimulation of the tooth and that associated with pulpal inflammation. Therefore, the short sharp pain of a tooth is transmitted to the brain by A delta fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
