    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the speed of conduction of A-alpha fibers. Document [0] mentions the conduction velocities of different types of fibers, including A-beta, A-delta, and C-fibers, but not A-alpha fibers. Document [5] mentions that nerve impulses are very fast compared to the speed of blood flow, with some myelinated neurons conducting at speeds up to 120 m/s. It also mentions that normal impulses in peripheral nerves of the legs travel at 40\u201345 m/s, and 50\u201365 m/s in peripheral nerves of the arms. However, it does not specify the type of fibers. Therefore, the information in Document [5] is the most relevant to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 70-120\"}"
