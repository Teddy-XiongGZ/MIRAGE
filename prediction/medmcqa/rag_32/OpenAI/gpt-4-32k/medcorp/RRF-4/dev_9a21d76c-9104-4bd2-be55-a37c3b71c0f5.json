    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation-induced thyroid cancer is caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, which can cause a range of mutations in the irradiated cells of the thyroid. These mutations are somatic, meaning they occur in the body cells and can lead to the development of cancer. Genetic mutations, on the other hand, are inherited and present in every cell of the body. Teratogenic effects refer to the ability of a substance to cause birth defects, while autosomal refers to chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes. Therefore, the type of radiation effect that results in radiation-induced thyroid cancer is somatic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
