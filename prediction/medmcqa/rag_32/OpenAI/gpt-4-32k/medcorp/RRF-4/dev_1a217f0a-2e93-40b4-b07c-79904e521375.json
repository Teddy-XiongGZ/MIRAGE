This means that the rash or blisters appear on one side of the body or face. This is a distinguishing feature of herpes zoster, as other vesiculobullous eruptions can occur on both sides of the body.

Subepidermal bullous formation is a feature of bullous diseases, not specifically herpes zoster.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
