    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the term that describes the dense fibrous connective tissue that holds bones together. From the documents, we can see that sutures are immobile joints found only in the cranium (Document [23]). Gomphosis occurs only between the teeth and adjacent bone (Document [27]). Synchondroses occur where two ossification centers in a developing bone remain separated by a layer of cartilage (Document [27]). Syndesmosis is a joint in which two adjacent bones are linked by a ligament (Document [27]). Therefore, the correct answer is Syndesmosis, as it is the only option that describes a connection between two bones by a ligament, which is a type of dense fibrous connective tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
