    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) but normal prothrombin time (PT). This suggests a deficiency in one of the factors in the intrinsic or common pathway of the coagulation cascade, which includes factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. Vitamin K deficiency and liver disease would affect both PT and aPTT, as Vitamin K is necessary for the synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, and X, and the liver is where most coagulation factors are produced. Therefore, options A and B can be ruled out. Hemophilia A is a deficiency in factor VIII, which would also prolong aPTT. However, the patient has no family history of bleeding, which is unusual for hemophilia A as it is an X-linked recessive disorder. Therefore, option D is less likely. Factor XII deficiency can prolong aPTT without causing a bleeding tendency, which matches the patient's presentation. Therefore, option C is the most likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
