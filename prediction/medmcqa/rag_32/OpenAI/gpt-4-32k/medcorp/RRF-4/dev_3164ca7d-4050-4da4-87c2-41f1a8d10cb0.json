    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eburnation of dentine refers to the process where the dentine becomes hard and shiny, often seen in chronic or arrested caries. This is because, in chronic or arrested caries, the caries progression is slow, allowing the dentine to react and form a protective layer, which appears as a shiny, hard surface. This is not seen in acute caries, where the progression is rapid, and the dentine does not have time to react and form this protective layer. Root caries refers to the location of the caries, not the type or stage of caries, so it does not provide information about the eburnation of dentine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
