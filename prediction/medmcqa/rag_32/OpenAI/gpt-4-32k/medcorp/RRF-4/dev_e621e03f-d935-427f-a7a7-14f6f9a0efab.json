    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child was weaned from breast milk and given sugarcane juice, which is high in fructose. The symptoms of hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly, along with the presence of reducing substances in the urine, suggest a problem with fructose metabolism. Fructokinase and Aldolase B are both involved in fructose metabolism. However, a deficiency in Fructokinase leads to essential fructosuria, which is a benign condition and does not cause hypoglycemia or hepatomegaly. On the other hand, Aldolase B deficiency leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, which can cause severe hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly after ingestion of fructose. Therefore, the child is likely suffering from Aldolase B deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Aldolase B\"}"
