    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper metabolism, which leads to the accumulation of copper in the body. This excess copper is excreted in the urine, leading to high copper levels in the urine. The serum copper levels are low because the copper is not properly metabolized and instead accumulates in the liver and other organs. Ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper in the bloodstream, is also typically low in Wilson's disease. Therefore, the correct answer should be low serum copper and high urinary copper.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Low serum copper\"}"
