    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-linking in resins is a process that forms covalent bonds to join two polymer chains together. This process can modify the mechanical properties of the resins. According to Document [1], the incorporation of cross-linking agent improves the mechanical properties of HEMA-based polymers. Strength and modulus tend to increase as the cross-linking agent concentration is increased. Document [14] also mentions that low cross-link densities increase the viscosities of polymer melts, while intermediate cross-link densities transform gummy polymers into materials that have elastomeric properties and potentially high strengths. Very high cross-link densities can cause materials to become very rigid or glassy. Document [21] also mentions that cross-linking of polymers through electron-beam processing changes a thermoplastic material into a thermoset, improving thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties. Therefore, cross-linking in resins helps in increasing strength, hardness, and crazing resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
