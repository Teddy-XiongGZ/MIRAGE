According to Document [12], the splint needs to be stabilized for up to four months in cervical fractures. This is also supported by Document [21] which suggests that long-term splinting favors hard tissue deposition, and Document [28] which mentions that in the case of a fracture affecting the coronal third of the root, splinting for at least 2 months is required.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 4 months\"}"
