    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the advantage of a wide palatal bar over a narrow one. From the documents, it is clear that a wide palatal bar provides more tissue coverage. Document [0] mentions that a wide palatal bar is useful in cases where we do not want to cover much of the palate. This implies that a wide bar covers more area than a narrow one. Document [2] also supports this by stating that deflection of the palatal bar and distal extension base was smaller when the bar was thicker and wider, which means it provides more coverage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
