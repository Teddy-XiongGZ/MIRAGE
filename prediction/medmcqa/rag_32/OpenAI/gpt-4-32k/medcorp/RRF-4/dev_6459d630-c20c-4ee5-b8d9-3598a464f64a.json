    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The recurrence rate of multicystic ameloblastoma after surgical enucleation is a key point in many of the provided documents. For instance, Document [2] mentions a recurrence rate of 33.3% after conservative treatments, which include enucleation. Document [4] states that solid and multicystic ameloblastomas have a high recurrence rate (60-80%) with simple enucleation. Document [6] mentions that all cases that recurred were primarily treated through conservative surgical technique, i.e., by enucleation. Document [12] states that enucleation plus curettage/peripheral ostectomy was associated with a high risk of recurrence. Document [22] mentions a recurrence rate of 41% for solid/multicystic ameloblastomas following conservative treatment. Document [23] states that 53.3% of the non-unicystic ameloblastomas presented at least 1 recurrence after enucleation and curettage. Document [28] states that the recurrence rate after conservative treatment was 90.9%. Document [29] mentions a recurrence rate of 41% for solid/multicystic ameloblastomas following conservative treatment. Document [30] states that the comparison of a conservative treatment approach versus radical in solid or multicystic ameloblastoma favored the radical. Document [31] mentions that conservative procedures such as enucleation and/or curettage result in local control rates of approximately 50% for multicystic ameloblastomas. Based on these documents, it is clear that the recurrence rate of multicystic ameloblastoma after surgical enucleation is high, and it is more than 50%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
