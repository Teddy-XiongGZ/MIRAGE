    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Golgi tendon organs are sensory receptors that are present in the musculotendinous junction of skeletal muscles. They are known to respond to changes in muscle tension. This is evident from Document [0] which states that Golgi tendon organs are a type of sensory receptor that senses changes in muscle tension. Document [1] also supports this by stating that the contraction of muscle fibers, which exerts strain on the collagenous bundle and causes deformation of sensory terminals, is the adequate stimulus of the tendon organ. Therefore, Golgi tendon organs are used to detect the tension of muscles. However, they also respond to both static and dynamic changes in muscle tension as indicated in Document [23] which states that Golgi tendon organs monitor muscle tension and function in parallel processing with other receptors and with the central control mechanisms of the nervous system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
