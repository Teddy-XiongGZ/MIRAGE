    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Collagen is a protein made up of amino acids. According to Document [0], Document [1], Document [2], and Document [24], the primary amino acid sequence of collagen is glycine-proline-X or glycine-X-hydroxyproline. However, the question asks for the amino acid used in the estimation of collagen. Document [20] mentions that hydroxyproline is a marker of collagen. Document [23] also mentions that the determination of hydroxyproline isomers in urine is the basic biochemical test for diseases involving the collagen molecule. Therefore, hydroxyproline is the amino acid used in the estimation of collagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
