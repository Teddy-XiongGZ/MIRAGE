    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of the body's arteries. The highest pressure, known as systolic pressure, occurs when the heart contracts and pumps blood into the arteries. The lowest pressure, known as diastolic pressure, occurs when the heart relaxes between beats. However, the question is asking about the location of the minimum blood pressure in the circulatory system, not during the cardiac cycle. Blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Therefore, the minimum blood pressure should be in the venules, which are the smallest veins that collect blood from the capillaries and gradually merge into larger veins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
