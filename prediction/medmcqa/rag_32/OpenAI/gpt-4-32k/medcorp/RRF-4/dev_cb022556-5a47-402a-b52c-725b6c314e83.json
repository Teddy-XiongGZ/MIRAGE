    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium nitroprusside is a medication used to lower blood pressure. According to Document [0], the pharmacological activation of sodium nitroprusside is related to the release of nitric oxide, which serves to activate Sodium Guanylyl Cyclase. Document [3] also explains that sodium nitroprusside produces nitric oxide, which triggers intracellular cGMP-mediated activation of protein kinase G, resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Therefore, the active metabolite of sodium nitroprusside acts through the activation of Guanylate cyclase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
