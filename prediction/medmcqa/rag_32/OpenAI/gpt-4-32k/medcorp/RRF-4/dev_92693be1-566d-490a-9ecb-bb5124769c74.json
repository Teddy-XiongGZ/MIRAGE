    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common location for caries to occur on a primary second molar. Document [28] states that caries in the primary second molars is a clinically useful predictor at 3-5 years of age for future dentin caries development on surfaces of the first permanent molars in the following 5 years. However, it does not specify the most common location for these caries. Document [8] states that in the maxilla, the most commonly affected teeth were primary molars, especially in the mandible. The surfaces of molars most often affected were the occlusal. This suggests that the occlusal surface is a common location for caries. Document [30] also supports this, stating that with regard to the permanent molars, caries was observed in 14.8% to 17.3% of the molar and most lesions were scored at the non-cavitation level. Caries in primary molars was most often recorded at the stage of cavitated dentine lesion. Teeth with pulpal involvement, sepsis and extracted due to caries were found to be more prevalent in first, and then in second primary molars. This suggests that the occlusal surface is a common location for caries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
