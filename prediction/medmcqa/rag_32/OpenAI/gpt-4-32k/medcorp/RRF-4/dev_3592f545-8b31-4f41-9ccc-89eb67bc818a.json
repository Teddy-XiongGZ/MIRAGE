    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Galactorrhoea-amenorrhea syndrome is characterized by the presence of galactorrhoea (milk production not related to breastfeeding) and amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). This syndrome is often associated with hyperprolactinemia, or high levels of prolactin in the blood. However, the question asks for an investigation apart from serum prolactin. Looking at the documents, Document [1] mentions that in patients with this syndrome, the level of LH (luteinizing hormone) is slightly decreased but the response to LRH is positive. Document [11] also mentions that treatment with bromocriptine in patients with normal gonadotrophins restores ovulation when the infertility is due to prolactin excess. This suggests that LH could be a relevant investigation in these patients. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) could also be relevant, as thyroid disorders can cause menstrual irregularities and galactorrhoea, but there is no specific mention of it in the context of Galactorrhoea-amenorrhea syndrome in the documents. hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is used to detect pregnancy, which is not relevant in this context. Urinary ketosteroids are used to detect adrenal gland disorders, which is also not relevant in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
