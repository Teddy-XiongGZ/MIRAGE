    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about the orientation of fibers in the sartorius, rectus abdominis, sternohyoid, and tibialis anterior muscles. Step 2: Document [0] mentions that the sartorius muscle, the longest muscle in the human body, is a strap muscle with fibers that run longitudinally to the contraction direction, which suggests that it has parallel oriented fibers. Step 3: No specific information about the rectus abdominis, sternohyoid, and tibialis anterior muscles is found in the documents. Step 4: Document [6] and [8] mention that pennate muscles have fibers oriented at an angle relative to the line of action, which is different from parallel orientation. Pennate muscles are usually found where their length change is less important than maximum force, such as the rectus femoris. Step 5: Based on the information available, it can be inferred that the rectus abdominis, sternohyoid, and tibialis anterior might not have parallel oriented fibers. However, without specific information about these muscles, it's not possible to definitively choose an answer.
