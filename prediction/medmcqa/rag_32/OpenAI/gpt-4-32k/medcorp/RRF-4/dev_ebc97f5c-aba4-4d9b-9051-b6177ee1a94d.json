    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Afterload is the pressure that the heart must work against to eject blood during systole. It is often assessed from the SVRI value, as mentioned in Document [0]. However, Document [5] suggests that SVR may not adequately assess left ventricular afterload as it reflects only peripheral vasomotor tone. Document [26] also mentions that afterload can be most easily described as the 'load' against which the heart ejects blood and is often measured using systemic arterial resistance. Therefore, the best index to measure cardiac afterload would be total peripheral resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
