    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Baroreceptors are a type of mechanoreceptor sensory neuron that are excited by a stretch of the blood vessel. This sensory information is used primarily in autonomic reflexes that in turn influence the heart cardiac output and vascular smooth muscle to influence vascular resistance. Baroreceptors act immediately as part of a negative feedback system called the baroreflex, as soon as there is a change from the usual mean arterial blood pressure, returning the pressure toward a normal level. These reflexes help regulate short-term blood pressure. Therefore, baroreceptors are a type of negative feedback.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
