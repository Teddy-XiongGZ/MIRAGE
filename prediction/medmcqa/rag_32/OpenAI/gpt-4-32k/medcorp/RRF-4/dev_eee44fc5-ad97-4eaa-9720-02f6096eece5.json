    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the extraction of third molars during sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) can be done safely and effectively, reducing the need for a separate surgical procedure and the associated stress for the patient. However, some studies also suggest that the extraction of third molars prior to SSO can reduce the risk of complications such as bad splits or nerve damage. The timing of the extraction seems to vary, with some suggesting it should be done at the time of the SSO, while others suggest it should be done months before the procedure. Document [1] suggests that third molars should ideally be removed 9 to 12 months before SSO. Document [10] also suggests that the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars, six months before the SSO is recommended to prevent the bad split incidence during the operation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 6 month before surgery\"}"
