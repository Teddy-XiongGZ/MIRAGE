    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of transfer of information from RNA to proteins is described in several documents. For example, Document [0] mentions that proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template, a process called translation. Document [1] also describes protein synthesis as consisting of two major steps: transcription and translation. Transcription is the process where information in DNA is used to produce RNA copies, while translation is the process where the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Therefore, the process of transfer of information from RNA to proteins is called translation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
