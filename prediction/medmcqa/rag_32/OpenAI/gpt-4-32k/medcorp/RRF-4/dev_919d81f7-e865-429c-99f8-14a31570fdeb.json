    "The TNM staging system is used to classify the progression of cancer. The \"T\" describes the size of the original tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, \"N\" describes nearby lymph nodes that are involved, and \"M\" describes distant metastasis. This system is used to assign a number from I to IV to a cancer, with I being an isolated cancer and IV being a cancer that has spread to the limit of what the assessment measures. This indicates that the TNM staging system is an ordinal scale, as it involves a clear order of stages from least to most severe. So, the answer is A. Ordinal.
