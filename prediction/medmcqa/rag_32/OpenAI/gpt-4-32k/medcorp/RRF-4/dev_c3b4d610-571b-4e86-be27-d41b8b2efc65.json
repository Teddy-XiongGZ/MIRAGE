    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The loading dose of a drug is the initial higher dose given at the beginning of a course of treatment to quickly achieve the therapeutic level of the drug in the body. The loading dose is calculated using the desired peak concentration of the drug, the volume of distribution of the drug in the body, the bioavailability of the drug, and the fraction of the drug salt form which is the active drug. Among these factors, the volume of distribution is the major determinant of the loading dose. This is because the volume of distribution is a measure of how much of the drug is distributed throughout the body versus remaining in the blood. A larger volume of distribution means the drug is more widely distributed in the body, and thus a larger loading dose is needed to achieve the desired therapeutic level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
