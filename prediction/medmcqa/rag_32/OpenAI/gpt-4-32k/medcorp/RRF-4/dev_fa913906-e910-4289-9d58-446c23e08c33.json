    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation can cause damage to blood vessels, leading to issues with blood supply. This is mentioned in Document [0], which talks about the effects of irradiation on blood vessels, leading to atherosclerotic-like disorder. Document [2] also mentions that radiation necrosis, which is the death of healthy tissue near the irradiated site, occurs because the radiation directly or indirectly damages blood vessels in the area, reducing the blood supply to the remaining healthy tissue. However, there is no mention of anemia or infection being caused by radiation, which rules out options A, C, and D. Therefore, the answer should be B, endarteritis of small blood vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
