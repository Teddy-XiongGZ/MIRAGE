    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The palate is innervated by several nerves. The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve provides sensory innervation to the palate as stated in Document [0]. The facial nerve carries sensory information from the soft palate as stated in Document [1]. The glossopharyngeal nerve carries taste from the posterior one-third of the tongue, soft palate, and palatal arches as stated in Document [16].
