    "The craniovertebral joint refers to the joint between the cranium (skull) and the first two vertebrae of the neck - the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2). The occipital condyle is a part of the cranium that articulates with the atlas, forming the atlanto-occipital joint, which is a part of the craniovertebral joint. The wings of the sphenoid, however, are part of the sphenoid bone in the skull and do not directly participate in the formation of the craniovertebral joint. So, the step-by-step thinking would be: 1. Identify the components of the craniovertebral joint: the cranium (specifically the occipital condyle), the atlas (C1), and the axis (C2). 2. Compare these components with the answer choices. 3. Identify that the wings of the sphenoid are not a part of the craniovertebral joint. Therefore, the answer is D. Wings of sphenoid.
