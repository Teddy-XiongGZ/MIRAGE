    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of fracture that occurs due to tensile forces during tooth structure cutting. Tensile forces typically cause a type of fracture known as brittle fracture. Ductile fracture is usually caused by shear or torsional forces, not tensile forces. Shear fracture, as the name suggests, is caused by shear forces. Therefore, the answer should be brittle fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
