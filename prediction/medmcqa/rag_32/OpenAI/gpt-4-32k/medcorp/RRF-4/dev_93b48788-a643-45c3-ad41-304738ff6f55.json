    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including LDL cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity. However, none of the documents specifically mention a LDL cholesterol level of more than 120 mg/dl or a history of salt intake of more than 6 gm/day as the best indicator of developing cardiovascular disease. The documents do mention the LDL/HDL ratio as an important predictor of heart disease, but it is not singled out as the best indicator. Therefore, none of the individual options (A, B, or C) can be definitively chosen as the best indicator of developing cardiovascular disease. However, since all these factors contribute to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the answer could be 'All of the above'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
