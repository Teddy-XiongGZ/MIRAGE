    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Z-track technique is mentioned in several documents, but the most relevant ones are Document [7], Document [14], Document [18], Document [28], and Document [31]. These documents all mention the Z-track technique in the context of administering injections, specifically intramuscular injections.
