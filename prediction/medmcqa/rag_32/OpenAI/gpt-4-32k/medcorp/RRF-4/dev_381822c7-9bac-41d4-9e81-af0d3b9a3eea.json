    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of numbness in hands and feet, generalized weakness, and constipation, along with the radiograph findings of linear lines on metaphyses of knee and wrist joints, suggest a case of heavy metal poisoning. The patient's occupation as a glass factory worker also supports this, as exposure to heavy metals is common in such industries. Among the given options, mercury and lead are heavy metals. However, the presence of linear lines, also known as lead lines, on the metaphyses of long bones is a classic sign of lead poisoning. Therefore, the patient's symptoms are likely due to lead poisoning. The best diagnostic test for lead poisoning is the measurement of blood lead levels. However, in the absence of this option, the measurement of amino levulinic acid levels in urine can also be used, as this is a sensitive test for lead exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Amino levulinic acid levels in urine\"}"
