    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelography is a type of radiographic examination that uses a contrast medium to detect pathology of the spinal cord. The contrast medium fills the subarachnoid space and outlines the structures within it. According to Document [23], spinal cord expansion after decompression is seen in patients with cervical myelopathy. However, this doesn't directly answer the question. Document [6] mentions that in intramedullary tumors, CT enabled more precise delineation of the extent and location of expansion of the spinal cord. This suggests that the contrast-filled space in myelography would expand in the presence of an intramedullary tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
