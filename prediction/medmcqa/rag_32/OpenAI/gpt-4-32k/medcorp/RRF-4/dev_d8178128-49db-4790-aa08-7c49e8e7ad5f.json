    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The access cavity of a tooth is the opening that is made in a tooth to allow for the removal of the pulp and the subsequent cleaning, shaping, and filling of the root canals during endodontic treatment. The shape of the access cavity is determined by the anatomy of the tooth. According to Document [15], the access cavity design did not significantly affect detection of middle mesial canals in extracted mandibular first molars. However, the use of an operating microscope increased the accuracy of the MMC identification, especially when associated with ultrasonic troughing. Document [28] also mentions that the access cavity of mandibular first molars, when present, is commonly associated with a second distal canal. However, none of the documents provided specific information about the shape of the access cavity of the mandibular 1st molar being oval, rounded triangle, or rhomboid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
