    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epidural hematoma is a type of traumatic brain injury. According to Document [0], it commonly results from a blow to the side of the head, particularly the pterion region, which overlies the middle meningeal artery. Document [7] also mentions that the cause is typically a head injury that results in a break of the temporal bone and bleeding from the middle meningeal artery. Document [17] further explains that an epidural hematoma can either be arterial or venous in origin, and the classical arterial epidural hematoma occurs after blunt trauma to the head, typically the temporal region, with damage to the middle meningeal artery causing arterial bleeding into the potential epidural space. Therefore, the middle meningeal artery is the cause of epidural hematoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
