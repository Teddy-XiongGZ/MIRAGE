    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by fever, hemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and hemoconcentration. Thrombocytopenia and hemoconcentration are distinguishing features between dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue fever. Some patients with dengue fever may have significant bleed and mild thrombocytopenia but no hemoconcentration.
