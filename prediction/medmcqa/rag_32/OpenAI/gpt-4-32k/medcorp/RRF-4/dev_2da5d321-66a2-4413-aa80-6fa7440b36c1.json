    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The distal palatal termination of the maxillary complete denture base is the point where the denture ends on the palate. According to Document [0], the maxillary complete denture posterior extension is determined by the vibrating line, which is the intersection between the soft and hard palate. The landmarks for the vibrating line are the fovea palatinae, but these are not the determining factor for the termination of the denture base. The tuberosity and maxillary torus are anatomical structures but do not dictate the distal palatal termination of the denture base.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
