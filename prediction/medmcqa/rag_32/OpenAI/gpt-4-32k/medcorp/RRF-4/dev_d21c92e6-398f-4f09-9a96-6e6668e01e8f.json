    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of a partograph, which is a tool used to monitor the progress of labor. Document [0] mentions that a partograph tracks changes in cervical dilation, effacement, and fetal station at standard timed intervals. It also mentions that a deviation to the right of the normal labor curve on the partograph denotes slow progress. Document [1] further explains that the partograph is used to alert midwives and obstetricians to deviations in labor progress. It also mentions that the earliest deviation in labor progress is slow labor progress, for which the partograph alert line is a prompt for early recognition. The intervention to correct the deviation is at the action line. However, none of the documents provide specific information about the characteristics of a partograph as mentioned in the answer choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unable to answer based on the provided documents\"}"
