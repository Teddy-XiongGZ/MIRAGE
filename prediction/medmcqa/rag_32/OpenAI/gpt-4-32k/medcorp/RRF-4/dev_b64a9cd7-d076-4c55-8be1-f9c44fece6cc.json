    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman is concerned about having another child with Down syndrome. While her age is below the high-risk group (35 years and above), she already has a child with Down syndrome which might increase the risk for the current pregnancy. An ultrasound alone cannot definitively diagnose Down syndrome. Blood screening can indicate a higher risk but cannot definitively diagnose Down syndrome. The most definitive way to diagnose Down syndrome prenatally is through chromosomal analysis of amniotic fluid samples, which can be obtained through amniocentesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Amniotic fluid samples plus chromosomal analysis will definitely tell her that next baby will be down syndromic or not\"}"
