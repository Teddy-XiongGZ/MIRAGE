    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that midline diastema is a common aesthetic concern and various treatment modalities have been employed to close diastemas. However, it is also mentioned that midline diastema is commonly cited as a malocclusion with high relapse incidence by orthodontists. This suggests that some form of retention might be necessary after treatment. Document [21] suggests that closure of the maxillary midline diastema with a prominent frenum is more predictable with frenectomy and concomitant orthodontic treatment than with frenectomy alone, indicating the importance of orthodontic treatment in maintaining the closure of the diastema. However, none of the documents provide a clear answer on the best method of retention after orthodontic treatment of midline diastema.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bonded lingual retainer\"}"
