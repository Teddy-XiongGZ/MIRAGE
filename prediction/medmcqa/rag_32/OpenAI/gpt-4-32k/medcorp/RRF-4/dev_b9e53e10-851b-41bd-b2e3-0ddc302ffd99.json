    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the immediate management of a patient with carcinoma of the larynx presenting with stridor. Stridor is a sign of upper airway obstruction and can be life-threatening. Document [0] suggests that immediate neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be a feasible and safe option for patients presenting with early stridor, but this is not one of the options provided. Document [3] suggests that emergency laryngectomy is not a superior treatment modality and offers no particular survival advantage. Document [10] suggests that if time permits, the obstructing laryngeal tumor should be debulked and the emergency situation should be stabilized. Document [25] suggests that the initial management of laryngeal injuries is to evaluate and establish an airway, and if the patient is showing signs of impending airway obstruction, tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy should be performed immediately. Based on these documents, the immediate management should be to establish an airway, which could involve a tracheostomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Immediate tracheostomy\"}"
