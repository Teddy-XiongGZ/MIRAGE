    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulmonary compliance is calculated using the formula \u0394V/\u0394P, where \u0394V is the change in volume, and \u0394P is the change in pleural pressure. In this case, the change in volume (\u0394V) is the tidal volume, which is 500 mL or 0.5 L. The change in pressure (\u0394P) is the difference in intrapleural pressure before and after inspiration, which is -9 cm H2O - (-4 cm H2O) = -5 cm H2O. Therefore, the pulmonary compliance is 0.5 L / 5 cm H2O = 0.1 L/cm H2O.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
