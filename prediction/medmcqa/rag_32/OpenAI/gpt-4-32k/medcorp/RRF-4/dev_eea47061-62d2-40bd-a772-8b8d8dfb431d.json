    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When two screening tests are done in series, it means that the second test is only performed if the first test is positive. This approach is used to confirm a positive result from the first test. Therefore, the overall specificity of the series of tests would increase because only those who tested positive in the first test (including true positives and false positives) are tested in the second round. This would decrease the chance of false positives, thus increasing specificity. However, sensitivity would decrease because all those who tested negative in the first test (including true negatives and false negatives) would not be tested in the second round. This would increase the chance of false negatives, thus decreasing sensitivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
