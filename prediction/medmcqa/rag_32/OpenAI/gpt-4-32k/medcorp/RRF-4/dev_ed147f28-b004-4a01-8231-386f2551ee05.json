    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ANB angle is a cephalometric measurement used to assess the anteroposterior relationship between the maxilla and the mandible. A negative ANB angle indicates that the mandible is positioned anteriorly relative to the maxilla, which is a characteristic of Class III malocclusion. The facial angle of 98\u00b0 is within the normal range (88\u00b0-100\u00b0), indicating a normal relationship between the cranial base and the maxilla. Therefore, the case is likely of a True Class III malocclusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. True Class III malocclusion\"}"
