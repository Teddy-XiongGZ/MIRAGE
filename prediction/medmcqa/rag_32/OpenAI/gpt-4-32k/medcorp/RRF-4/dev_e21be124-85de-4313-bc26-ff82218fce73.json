    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pulp horn of primary molars that is commonly exposed during restorative procedures. Document [10] provides information about the closest distance of mesio-buccal and disto-buccal pulp horns to the enamel surface in primary molars. According to the document, the closest distance of mesio-buccal pulp horn to enamel surface is 2.5\u00b10.20 mm for right and 2.29\u00b10.17 mm for left teeth. The closest distance of disto-buccal pulp horn to enamel surface is significantly different between left and right teeth. However, the document does not specify whether these measurements are for 1st or 2nd molars. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
