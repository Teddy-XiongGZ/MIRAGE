    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the average diameter of the apical foramen in patients above 55 years old. Document [13] mentions that the foramen of Monro had oval-shaped openings averaging 5.23 mm2 in people above age 55. However, this is not the apical foramen. Document [18] mentions that instrumentation and obturation should take place 1 mm from the AF in older patients, but it does not provide the diameter. Document [20] mentions that revascularization procedures can be implemented in any age ranging from 9 to 18 years, but it does not provide the diameter for patients above 55 years old. Document [26] mentions that the apical constriction was found to be located at or close to the foramen and the most common form was the parallel form, but it does not provide the diameter for patients above 55 years old. None of the documents provide the specific information needed to answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
