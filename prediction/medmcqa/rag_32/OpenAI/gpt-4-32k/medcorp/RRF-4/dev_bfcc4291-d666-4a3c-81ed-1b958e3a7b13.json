    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A 'cut back' incision is a technique used in flap surgery to increase the mobility of the flap. It is typically made at the far end of the incision, bringing the pivot point closer to the primary defect. This technique is often used to decrease pivotal restraint, which is the tension that can limit the rotation of a flap. The 'cut back' incision is made distally, meaning it is made away from the point of attachment of the flap (the donor site) and towards the recipient site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Distal cut toward the recipient site\"}"
