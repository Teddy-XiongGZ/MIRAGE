    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Shock is a complex condition that can be caused by various factors and can manifest in different ways. However, there are some common features across all types of shock. Vasoconstriction is not common to all types of shock, as some types of shock, like distributive shock, are characterized by vasodilation. Sepsis is a cause of a specific type of shock (septic shock) and not a common feature of all types of shock. Bradycardia, or slow heart rate, is not a common feature of all types of shock; in fact, tachycardia, or fast heart rate, is more commonly associated with shock. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is a common feature of all types of shock, as shock is essentially a state of insufficient blood flow to the tissues of the body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
