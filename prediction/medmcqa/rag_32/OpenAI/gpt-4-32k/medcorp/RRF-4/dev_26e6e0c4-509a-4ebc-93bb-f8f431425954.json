    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin resistance is a condition where the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. When this happens, the body needs higher levels of insulin to help glucose enter cells. In the context of liver disease, insulin resistance is often seen. According to the documents, insulin resistance contributes to the accumulation of toxic fat in the liver, promoting the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue into the blood and promoting the production of new FFAs in the liver. This process leads to hepatic steatosis, or fatty liver disease. Therefore, hepatic steatosis is a result of insulin resistance, not a cause. Decreased secretion of insulin and low 'C' peptide level are not mentioned as causes of insulin resistance in liver disease. Hepatocyte dysfunction could be a result of insulin resistance, but it's not the cause of insulin resistance itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Hepatic steatosis\"}"
