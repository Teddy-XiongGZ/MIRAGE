    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intrafusal fibers are of two types: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. Nuclear bag fibers are larger and shorter than nuclear chain fibers, which contradicts option A. Nuclear chain fibers are indeed shorter and thinner, which supports option B. Primary endings are excited by both nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers, which contradicts option D. However, secondary endings are not excited by chain fibers only, they are also excited by bag fibers, which contradicts option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
