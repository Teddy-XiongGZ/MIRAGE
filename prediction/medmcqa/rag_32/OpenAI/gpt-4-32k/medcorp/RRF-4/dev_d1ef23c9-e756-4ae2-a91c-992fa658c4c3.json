    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CSF Rhinorrhoea is a condition where cerebrospinal fluid leaks through the nose. This condition can lead to serious complications such as meningitis if left untreated. According to the documents, the treatment of CSF Rhinorrhoea often involves surgery, specifically neurosurgery. Document [20] mentions that surgery is usually necessary to prevent the spread of infection to the meninges. Document [24] also suggests that surgery is the treatment of choice for the repair of a CSF leak following dopamine agonist treatment. Document [17] also mentions that endoscopic techniques combined with intrathecal fluorescein dye enable most defects to be located and sealed with minimal morbidity. Therefore, the immediate treatment of CSF Rhinorrhoea would not involve just antibiotics and observation, plugging with paraffin gauge, or blowing of the nose. Instead, it would involve a surgical procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Craniotomy\"}"
