    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the conditions that do not result in false positive results on EPT testing. From Document [4], we know that EPT may result in false-positive responses in teeth with pulpal necrosis. It also mentions that EPT must be done with tooth isolation and improper isolation can result in false-positive responses. Therefore, options B and C are true regarding false positive results on EPT testing. The document does not mention anything about an immature apex or anxiety causing false positives. Therefore, we need to determine which of these two options is not associated with false positives in EPT testing. Since anxiety is a psychological condition and not a physical condition of the tooth, it is less likely to cause a false positive in a tooth test like EPT. Therefore, the answer is D. Anxiety.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
