    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the trimming of gutta percha in the context of gingival recession. Gutta percha is used in root canal treatment to fill the space within the root canal after the infected pulp has been removed. The documents do not provide specific information about how far the gutta percha should be trimmed back before sealing the coronal area in the context of gingival recession. However, Document [3] suggests that gutta-percha removal must be efficient and clean the existing canals so that subsequent irrigants can effectively cleanse the root canal system. It is recommended that GP be removed without solvents in the coronal two-thirds of canals as much as possible and with solvents in the apical third. This does not directly answer the question but gives an idea about the general approach to gutta-percha removal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1 mm below the canal opening\"}"
