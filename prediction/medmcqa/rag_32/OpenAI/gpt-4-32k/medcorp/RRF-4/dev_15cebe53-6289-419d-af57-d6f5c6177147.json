    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that proteinuria is a feature of preeclampsia, but the level of proteinuria does not necessarily determine the severity of the condition. However, some documents suggest that higher levels of proteinuria may be associated with more severe outcomes or complications. The documents do not provide a specific level of proteinuria that is used to diagnose severe preeclampsia. However, Document [3] mentions that the classic cutoff to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of >300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. This is the closest match to the options provided in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
