Document [2] and Document [3] mention chemotherapy as a treatment option. Document [3] also mentions surgical resection as a treatment option, but this is usually followed by chemotherapy.

Therefore, the treatment of choice for a 35-year-old female with choriocarcinoma would be chemotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Chemotherapy\"}"
