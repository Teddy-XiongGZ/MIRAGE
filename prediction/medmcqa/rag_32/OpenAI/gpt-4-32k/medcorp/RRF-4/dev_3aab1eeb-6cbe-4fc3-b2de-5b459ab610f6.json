    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the appropriate investigations for a suspected dengue patient at day 3 of presentation. According to Document [14], viral detection diagnostic methods such as NS1 antigen assays are generally used within the first week of illness onset. This makes option C acceptable. Document [25] also mentions that NS1 antigen detection is useful for early clinical diagnosis of dengue. As for viral culture and isolation in C6/36 cell line (option A), it is a method used for dengue virus isolation and can be done early in the disease as per Document [2]. However, ELISA for antibody against dengue virus (option B) might not be useful at day 3 of presentation. According to Document [14] and Document [19], serological tests for dengue virus antibodies (IgM and IgG) are usually positive after the first week of illness onset. Therefore, it might not be an acceptable investigation at day 3 of presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
