    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. According to Document [13], basal-cell carcinoma cells appear similar to epidermal basal cells, and are usually well differentiated. In uncertain cases, immunohistochemistry using BerEP4 can be used, having a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting only BCC cells. Document [12] also mentions that histopathology shows aggregates of basaloid cells with well-defined borders, showing a peripheral palisading of cells. This suggests that nuclear palisading is a characteristic feature of basal cell carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
