    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection in primary molars. Document [25] mentions that histological evidence of pulpitis correlated with dental caries depth of \u226580%, residual dentin thickness (RDT) of \u22641 mm, radiographic rarefactions in the interradicular regions and symptoms of pain. This suggests that changes in the interradicular regions, which is the furcation area, could be an early sign of chronic pulpal infection. The other options such as periapical bony changes, root resorption, and widening of apical periodontal ligament are also signs of pulpal infection, but the documents do not specify them as the first signs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
