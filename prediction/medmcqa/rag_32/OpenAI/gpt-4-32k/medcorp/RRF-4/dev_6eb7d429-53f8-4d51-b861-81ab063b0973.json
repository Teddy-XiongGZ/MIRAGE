    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each choice means. Compressive strength refers to the ability of a material to withstand loads that reduce size. Crazing refers to the phenomenon that produces a network of fine cracks on the surface of a material. Fracture strength is the stress at which a specimen fails via fracture. Inter occlusal distance is the space between the occluding surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular teeth when the jaws are in physiological rest position. Now, I will look for information in the documents that relate to these concepts. Document 2 mentions that artificial resin teeth have excellent properties and their wear behavior is important for predicting good clinical performance. However, it also mentions that the wear loss for all cross-linked acrylic resin teeth were higher than for all composite resin teeth but lower than those for conventional acrylic resin teeth. This suggests that resin teeth may not have a high compressive or fracture strength. Document 14 mentions that the tensile bond strength of acrylic resin denture teeth to a microwave- or heat-processed denture base was tested, but it does not provide information about the compressive or fracture strength of the resin teeth. Document 26 mentions that composite crowns made of hardening composite material with clear plastic or mold are widely used in restoring the anterior teeth of children, but they are more prone to fracture. This suggests that resin teeth may not have a high fracture strength. None of the documents suggest that resin teeth are contraindicated in patients with decreased inter occlusal distance or that they show crazing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
