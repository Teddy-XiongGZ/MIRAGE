    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the properties of both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement. From Document [1], I learned that zinc oxide eugenol cement is a phenolate cement, while polycarboxylate cement is a phosphate cement. Document [3] further explains that zinc oxide eugenol cement is a non-aqueous/oil bases acid-base cement, while polycarboxylate cement is a water-based acid-base cement. Document [18] mentions that zinc oxide eugenol cement is not radiographically detectable, but it doesn't mention anything about polycarboxylate cement. Document [11] suggests that polycarboxylate cement is more biologically compatible than zinc phosphate cement, but it doesn't compare it with zinc oxide eugenol cement. Document [21] mentions that cements containing zinc are the most detectable upon radiographic analysis, which includes both zinc oxide eugenol and polycarboxylate cement. However, this doesn't necessarily mean they have a chemical bond to tooth structure. Document [29] mentions that zinc polycarboxylate was the first cement to bind to tooth structure, but it doesn't mention anything about zinc oxide eugenol cement. Therefore, the only common property I can find between zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement is that they both contain zinc.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Chemical bond to tooth structure\"}"
