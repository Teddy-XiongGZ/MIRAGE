    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [5] suggests that the thickness of 4 mm is most adequate for the use of MTA as a root-end filling material. However, this is not one of the options. Document [26] states that there was no significant difference in the percentage of gaps among the tested materials at 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm. However, it does not specify which thickness is ideal. Document [30] does not provide a specific depth for root end filling with MTA. Therefore, based on the available documents and options, 3mm seems to be the most reasonable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
