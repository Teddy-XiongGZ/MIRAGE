    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most likely location of a missing distal root of a mandibular third molar. The mandibular third molar is located in the lower jaw, and its roots are embedded in the jawbone. If a root was missing during extraction, it would likely remain within the surrounding structures. The submental space is located under the chin, which is not close to the location of the mandibular third molar. The parapharyngeal space is located near the pharynx, which is also not close to the location of the mandibular third molar. The pterygomandibular space is located between the mandible and the pterygoid muscles, which is closer to the location of the mandibular third molar but not the closest. The submandibular space is located under the mandible, which is the closest to the location of the mandibular third molar. Therefore, if the distal root of a mandibular third molar was missing during extraction, it would most likely be in the submandibular space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
