    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a child with pustular lesions and the culture from the lesion showed hemolytic colonies on the blood agar which were Gram-positive cocci. This is suggestive of a streptococcal infection. The differentiating tests for streptococci include sensitivity to optochin, bacitracin, and bile solubility, and catalase reaction. Optochin sensitivity is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae, not group A streptococci. Catalase positivity is characteristic of staphylococci, not streptococci. Bile solubility is also a characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacitracin sensitivity, however, is a characteristic of group A streptococci, which is consistent with the diagnosis of streptococcal pyoderma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
