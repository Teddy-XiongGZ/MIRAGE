    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemophilia is a genetic disease caused by a deficiency of blood coagulation factor VIII or IX as stated in Document [2]. This means that the blood of hemophiliacs takes longer to clot, which would increase the clotting time. However, the bleeding time, which is the time it takes for a small wound to stop bleeding, is not directly affected by hemophilia. Therefore, hemophiliacs would have a normal bleeding time but an increased clotting time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Normal bleeding time and increased clotting time\"}"
