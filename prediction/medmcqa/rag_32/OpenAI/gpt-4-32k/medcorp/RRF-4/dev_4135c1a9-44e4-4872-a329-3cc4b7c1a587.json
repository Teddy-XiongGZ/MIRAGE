    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the composition of both zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement. From Document [0], I know that zinc eugenol cement is a type of phenolate cement, while polycarboxylate cement is a type of polycarboxylate cement. Document [26] provides more details about the composition of polycarboxylate cement, which includes poly(acrylic) acid as a liquid component. However, there is no mention of poly(acrylic) acid in the composition of zinc eugenol cement, so option A is incorrect. Document [15] mentions that polycarboxylate cement adheres to the tooth structure, but there is no similar information about zinc eugenol cement, so option B is also incorrect. Document [26] also mentions that polycarboxylate cement adheres to enamel and dentine by means of chelation reaction, but again, there is no similar information about zinc eugenol cement, so option C is incorrect. Finally, Document [27] mentions that zinc oxide eugenol cements can be modified by adding EBA to increase their strength, but there is no mention of a similar modification for polycarboxylate cement, so option D is also incorrect. Therefore, none of the provided options are common to both zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
