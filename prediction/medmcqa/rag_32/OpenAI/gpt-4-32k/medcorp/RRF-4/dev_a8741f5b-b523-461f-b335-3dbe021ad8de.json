    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Postductal coarctation of the aorta is a condition where the narrowing of the aorta occurs distal to the ductus arteriosus. This condition often presents as hypertension in the upper extremities and weak pulses in the lower extremities. According to the documents, in postductal coarctation, the blood flow to the lower extremities is maintained through collateral circulation. This collateral circulation most often occurs through the subclavian artery into the internal thoracic artery which goes to the anterior intercostal artery, to the posterior intercostal artery, and finally into the descending thoracic aorta. The superior epigastric artery also plays a significant role in providing collateral circulation to the lower extremities in postductal coarctation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Intercostal arteries and superior epigastric artery\"}"
