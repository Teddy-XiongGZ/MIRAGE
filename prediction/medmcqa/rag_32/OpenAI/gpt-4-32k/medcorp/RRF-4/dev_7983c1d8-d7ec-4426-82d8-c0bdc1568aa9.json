    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 9-year-old boy with a lytic lesion on the midshaft of the tibia. The histopathological examination (HPE) reveals grooved nuclei, giant cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, and fibroblastic proliferation. These findings suggest a tumor with giant cells, which narrows down the options to Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Giant cell tumor. However, Langerhans cell histiocytosis typically presents with 'coffee bean' nuclei on histology, which is not mentioned in the question. On the other hand, Giant cell tumors are characterized by the presence of giant cells, and they typically affect the epiphysis of long bones. However, they can occasionally occur in unusual locations such as the midshaft of the tibia, especially in younger patients. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a Giant cell tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
