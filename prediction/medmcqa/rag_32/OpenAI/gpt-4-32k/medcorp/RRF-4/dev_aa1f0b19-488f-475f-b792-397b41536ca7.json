    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about the structures present in a living pulp. Document [25] mentions that the pulp mass contains various cell types and an extracellular matrix composed of collagenous fibers. This means that collagen fibers (Choice A) are present in a living pulp. Document [6] mentions that dental pulp tissue from elephants was examined and no nerve fibers (myelinated or non-myelinated) were demonstrable. However, this does not necessarily mean that non-myelinated nerve fibers (Choice C) are not present in a living pulp of other species. Document [17] also mentions that the central pulp zone contains large vessels and nerves, which could include non-myelinated nerve fibers. I couldn't find any information about Haversian fibers (Choice B) or Reticulum (Choice D) in the provided documents. However, Haversian fibers are typically associated with bone tissue, not pulp tissue. Therefore, it is likely that Haversian fibers are not found in a living pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
