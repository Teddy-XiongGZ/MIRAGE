These can include an increased risk of allergies due to the immature immune system of the child (Choice A), potential risk of gastrointestinal infection if the child's digestive system is not ready for solid foods (Choice B), and possible issues with oro-motor development as the child's swallowing mechanism may not be fully developed (Choice C).
