    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vasopressin antagonists are agents that interfere with the action at the vasopressin receptors. Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), plays a crucial role in maintaining water balance in the body. It does this by increasing water permeability in the collecting ducts of the kidney, allowing for water reabsorption and the excretion of more concentrated urine. This effect is mediated by V2 receptors. Therefore, the vasopressin antagonist would act on the part of the nephron where vasopressin has its effect, which is the collecting duct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
