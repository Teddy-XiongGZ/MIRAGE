Looking through the documents, there is no mention of a person named Clam, Wein, or Mullaney associated with the modification of the step back technique.

Therefore, none of the documents provide a clear answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
