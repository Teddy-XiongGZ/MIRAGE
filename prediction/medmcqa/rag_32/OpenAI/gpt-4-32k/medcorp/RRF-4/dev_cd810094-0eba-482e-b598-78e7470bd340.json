    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child is asymptomatic and the urine sample was obtained by mid-stream clean-catch void. According to Document [1], a positive urinary culture is required to diagnose a urinary tract infection in children. However, the cutoff for a 'clean-catch' mid-stream sample is 105CFU/mL. The child's urine culture shows E. coli 1,00,000 cc/ml, which is equivalent to 105CFU/mL. This means the child has asymptomatic bacteriuria. According to Document [0], when significant bacteriuria is noted in asymptomatic children, a new urine sample is collected for analysis. If asymptomatic bacteriuria is again noted, the children are treated with a relevant antibiotic. However, this is not a case of acute urinary tract infection, so choice A is not correct. Prophylactic antibiotics for 6 months (choice C) or long term urine alkalinizer (choice D) are not mentioned in the documents as appropriate steps for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to not administer any therapy (choice B) and monitor the child.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
