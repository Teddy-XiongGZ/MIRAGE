    "Step 1: Review each choice in the context of the provided documents. Step 2: Choice A - \"Common in poor socioeconomic group\". Document [1] mentions that rheumatic fever risk factors include malnutrition and poverty, which are common in poor socioeconomic groups. So, this statement is true. Step 3: Choice B - \"Develops after streptococcal pharyngitis\". Document [1] and [25] both mention that rheumatic fever can develop after a streptococcal throat infection. So, this statement is also true. Step 4: Choice C - \"Communicable disease\". None of the documents suggest that rheumatic fever is a communicable disease.
