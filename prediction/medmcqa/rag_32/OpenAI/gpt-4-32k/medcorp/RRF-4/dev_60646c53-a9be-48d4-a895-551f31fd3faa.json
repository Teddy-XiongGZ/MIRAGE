    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that the impact direction and the presence of axial loading during impact significantly affect the fracture pattern obtained. It also mentions that impacts on the lateral and anterior aspects of the bones produce more and longer fracture lines than impacts on the contralateral side. However, it does not specify the type of fracture. Document [22] mentions that only bones that were damaged by a rounded impact body result in a 'false' butterfly fragment; in all other cases where the impact body is flat and wide, double trapezoid fragments are observed in the area of impact. This suggests that the type of fracture can vary depending on the nature of the impact. However, it does not specify the type of fracture either. Document [31] mentions that significant and possibly irreversible articular cartilage damage occurs after a single high-energy impact load, but it does not specify the type of fracture. None of the documents provide a clear answer to the question. However, based on the information in Document [0], it can be inferred that a direct impact on the bone can potentially cause a comminuted fracture, which is characterized by the bone breaking into several pieces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Comminuted fracture\"}"
