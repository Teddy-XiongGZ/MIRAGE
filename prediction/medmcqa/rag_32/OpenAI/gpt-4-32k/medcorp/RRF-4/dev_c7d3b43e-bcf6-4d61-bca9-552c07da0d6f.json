    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that infants of diabetic mothers are at risk of hypoglycemia (Document 0, Document 1, Document 5, Document 6, Document 25, Document 30). Birth asphyxia is also mentioned as a risk factor for hypoglycemia (Document 30). However, there is no mention of respiratory distress syndrome or post term infants being at risk for hypoglycemia.

Since post term infants are not typically associated with hypoglycemia, I will choose this as the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
