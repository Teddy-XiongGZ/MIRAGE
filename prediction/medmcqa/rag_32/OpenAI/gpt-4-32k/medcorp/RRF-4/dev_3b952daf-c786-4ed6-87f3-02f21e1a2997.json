    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has normal renal function and new onset focal seizures. Sodium valproate is an effective antiepileptic drug, but it has a risk of causing liver toxicity. Oxcarbazepine can cause hyponatremia. Pregabalin is primarily used for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, not as a first-line treatment for seizures. Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic medication that is effective in treating generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and partial-onset seizures. It is also excreted in urine mostly unchanged, which means it doesn't require dose adjustment in those with normal renal function. Therefore, Levetiracetam seems to be the best choice for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
