    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The access cavity shape is determined by the number and location of the root canals in a tooth. According to Document [0], mandibular first molars can have either three or four canals. Document [1] mentions that traditional access cavities (TAC) and conservative access cavities (CAC) are used in mandibular molars, but it does not specify the shape. Document [13] suggests that the access cavity design does not significantly affect the detection of middle mesial canals in extracted mandibular first molars. Document [15] mentions that the access cavity design did not significantly affect detection of middle mesial canals in extracted mandibular first molars. However, none of the documents provide a direct answer to the question. Therefore, based on the general knowledge, the access cavity shape for a mandibular first molar with four canals is typically trapezoidal to allow access to all canals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
