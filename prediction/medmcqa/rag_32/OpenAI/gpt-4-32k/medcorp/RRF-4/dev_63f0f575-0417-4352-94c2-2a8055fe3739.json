    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the properties of high copper silver alloy. Document [7] mentions that high copper amalgams show superior physical properties and clinical performance to low copper amalgams. This suggests that high copper silver alloy likely has increased tensile and compressive strength (Choice A) and greater edge strength (Choice C). Document [26] mentions that crowns made of the silver-palladium alloy were tarnished and had rough occlusal surfaces more often than crowns made of the low-gold and high-gold alloys. This suggests that high copper silver alloy may have poor tarnish and corrosion resistance (Choice B). However, none of the documents mention anything about the mercury content in the final restoration of high copper silver alloy. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether the statement in Choice D is true or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
