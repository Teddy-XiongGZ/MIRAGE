    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anti-D immunoglobulin is given to RhD negative women who have potentially been exposed to RhD positive blood during pregnancy to prevent the development of RhD antibodies and subsequent hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in future pregnancies. This includes procedures where there is a risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage such as amniocentesis, intrauterine transfusion, and manual removal of placenta. However, in the case of an abortion at 63 days, the fetus is too small to cause a significant fetomaternal hemorrhage, and thus, the risk of RhD alloimmunization is very low.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
