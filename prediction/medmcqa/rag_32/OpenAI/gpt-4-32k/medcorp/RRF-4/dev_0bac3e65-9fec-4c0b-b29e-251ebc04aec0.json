    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A temporary bridge is a dental prosthesis used to fill in the gap created by a missing tooth or teeth. It is typically made from a synthetic resin and is used as a temporary solution until a permanent bridge can be placed. The temporary bridge should mimic the shape and function of the permanent bridge as closely as possible. This includes having the same buccal and lingual contours as the permanent bridge, which helps to maintain normal speech and chewing function. It should also restore the occlusion to the same extent as the permanent bridge, which helps to prevent bite problems and jaw issues. Therefore, the temporary bridge is not dependent on whether the missing tooth is provided on a partial denture, and the type of cement used for retention is not specified in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Should have the same buccal and lingual contours as the permanent bridge\"}"
