    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of maximum chance of perforation during post preparation in the distal canal of mandibular first molar. According to Document 1, the perforation rate was higher when using larger-sized posts, and perforation mainly occurred at the distal side of mesial roots. However, this does not provide information about the distal canal. Document 23 states that the thinnest walls in C-shaped canals in mandibular first premolars are the mesial walls. Document 26 also mentions that the thinnest area around the canals should be considered during endodontic treatments. However, these documents do not specifically mention the distal canal of mandibular first molar. Document 27 states that after intracanal procedures, the buccal and lingual canal walls displayed significantly lower residual dentin thickness than the mesial and distal walls. However, this is about the palatal roots of maxillary molars. Document 12 states that the distal canal is the better place to insert the post than the mesiobuccal canal in mandibular first molar. However, this does not provide information about the location of maximum chance of perforation in the distal canal. Therefore, based on the available documents, it is not possible to definitively determine the location of maximum chance of perforation during post preparation in the distal canal of mandibular first molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
