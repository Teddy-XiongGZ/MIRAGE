    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that activation of lysosomal Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) oxidase by phorbol ester may result in increase of intralysosomal O2- and H2O2, which are reactive oxygen species. This suggests that NADPH oxidase is responsible for the release of reactive oxygen metabolites in lysosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
