    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the percentage of maxillary 1st molars that have two palatal roots. Document [1] states that the prevalence of two palatal roots was 0.31% in maxillary first molars. Document [2] also mentions that only three maxillary first molars (0.17%) were four-rooted, which could potentially include two palatal roots. Document [4] mentions that the overall prevalence of anatomic variations in the palatal canal of maxillary first and second molars was less than 2%. Document [15] mentions that the presence of two palatal roots (2PR) in permanent maxillary molars (PMMs) could be predicted by observing dental morphological traits during the clinical examination. However, it does not provide a specific percentage for maxillary 1st molars. Document [30] states that among 1365 maxillary first molars, only one tooth had four separated roots, which could potentially include two palatal roots. This would be less than 0.1%. Based on these documents, the percentage of maxillary 1st molars with two palatal roots is less than 1%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
