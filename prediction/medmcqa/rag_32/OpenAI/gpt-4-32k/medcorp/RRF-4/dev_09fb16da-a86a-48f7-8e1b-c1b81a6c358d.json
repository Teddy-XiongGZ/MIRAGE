    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the fixation period for intrusive luxation injury. Looking at the documents, none of them provide a specific time frame for the fixation period of an intrusive luxation injury. However, Document [13] mentions that the splint was removed 1 month later after an intrusive luxation injury. This suggests that the fixation period could be around 4 weeks. However, this is only one case and may not represent the general guideline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 4 weeks\"}"
