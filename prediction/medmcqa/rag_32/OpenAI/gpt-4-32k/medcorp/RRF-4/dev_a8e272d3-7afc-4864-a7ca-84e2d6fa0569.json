    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the preferable type of composite for a core build-up on a molar tooth. According to Document 10, chemical-cured bonding systems displayed a greater bond strength than light-cured ones. This is important for a core build-up as it needs to be strong and well-bonded to the tooth structure. Document 6 also supports this, stating that chemical-cured bonding systems had higher bond strength than light-cured ones. The viscosity of the resin is not mentioned in the documents, so we cannot make a conclusion about that. Therefore, the answer is not about the strength, brittleness, or opacity of the light cure resin, but about the superior bond strength of the chemical-cured composite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
