    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not directly state the principle on which rapid tooth separation works. However, from the information given in Document [0], it can be inferred that the Kansal Separator, a device used for tooth separation, works by applying force on both mesial and distal aspects of the tooth, causing separation. This seems to align more with the concept of a wedge, which is a simple machine that transforms lateral force into vertical force. Therefore, it can be inferred that the wedge principle is involved in rapid tooth separation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
