    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the centre of rotation during tooth intrusion. Document [5] mentions that the centre of resistance, which is the point around which a tooth rotates, must be presumed to be more distal than previously assumed. However, it does not specify the exact location. Document [24] also discusses tooth rotation but does not provide a clear answer to the question. None of the other documents seem to provide relevant information on this topic. Therefore, based on the available documents, it is not possible to definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
