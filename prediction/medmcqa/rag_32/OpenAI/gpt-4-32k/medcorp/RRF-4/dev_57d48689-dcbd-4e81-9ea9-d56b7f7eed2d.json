    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [3], carbon steel is broken down into four classes based on carbon content: Low-carbon steel 0.05 to 0.25% carbon content, Medium-carbon steel Approximately 0.3\u20130.5% carbon content, High-carbon steel Approximately 0.6 to 1.0% carbon content, and Ultra-high-carbon steel Approximately 1.25\u20132.0% carbon content. Therefore, the percentage of carbon in carbon steel hand instruments can vary depending on the type of carbon steel used. However, none of the options provided fall within the range of 10-12% or 6-8%. The options 1-1.2% and 0.6 to 0.8% fall within the range for high-carbon steel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 1-1.2%\"}"
