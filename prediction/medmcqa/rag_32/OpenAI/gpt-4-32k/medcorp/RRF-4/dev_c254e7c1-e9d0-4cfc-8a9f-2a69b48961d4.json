    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a replanted avulsed tooth that shows loss of lamina dura radiographically and a high sound on percussion. These symptoms are indicative of replacement resorption, also known as ankylosis. This condition occurs when the periodontal ligament cells are damaged or necrotic, leading to the tooth root being resorbed and replaced by bone. This is often a result of trauma or avulsion, and the tooth is typically stable but may sound different on percussion due to the lack of a periodontal ligament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Replacement resorption\"}"
