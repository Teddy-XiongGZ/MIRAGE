    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which primary tooth resembles a premolar. From Document [0], we learn that the maxillary first molars (upper 1st molar) morphologically resemble both a molar and a premolar. This suggests that the upper 1st molar has characteristics of a premolar. The other documents do not provide information that the other options (lower 1st molar, upper 2nd molar, lower 2nd molar) resemble a premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Upper 1st molar\"}"
