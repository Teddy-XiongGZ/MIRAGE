    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the treatment of choice for a patient with both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis. Document [5] suggests that if a gonococcal infection cannot be ruled out, treatment should add ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly once to cover for gonococcal infection. Document [11] also recommends administering an injection dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly for gonococcal urethritis. For non-gonococcal urethritis, the same document recommends administering an oral single dose of azithromycin 1g. Therefore, the treatment of choice for a patient with both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis would involve both ceftriaxone and azithromycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
