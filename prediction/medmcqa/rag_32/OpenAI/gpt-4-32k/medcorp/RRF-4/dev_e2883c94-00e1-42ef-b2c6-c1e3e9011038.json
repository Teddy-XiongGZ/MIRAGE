    "Step 1: Review the options and identify the relevant information in the documents. Step 2: Option A states that the oculomotor nerve carries parasympathetic fibers. Document [11] confirms that the oculomotor nerve controls the constriction of the pupils and thickening of the lens of the eye, which are parasympathetic functions. Step 3: Option B states that the oculomotor nerve causes constriction of pupils. This is also confirmed by Document [11]. Step 4: Option C states that the oculomotor nerve supplies the inferior oblique muscle. Document [10] confirms that the oculomotor nerve controls the inferior oblique muscle. Step 5: Option D states that the oculomotor nerve passes through the inferior orbital fissure. However, Document [18] states that the oculomotor nerve exits the brainstem and crosses straight to the superior orbital fissure, not the inferior orbital fissure. Based on the above analysis, the statement that is not true about the oculomotor nerve is that it passes through the inferior orbital fissure. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each option and found supporting information in the documents for options A, B, and C. However, for option D, the document indicated that the oculomotor nerve passes through the superior orbital fissure, not the inferior orbital fissure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
