    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Axonal transport is the process by which materials are moved within a neuron. According to the documents, there are two types of axonal transport: anterograde, which is movement of molecules/organelles outward, from the cell body to the synapse or cell membrane, and retrograde, which is movement of molecules/organelles away from axon termini toward the cell body. Therefore, axonal transport can be both anterograde and retrograde.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
