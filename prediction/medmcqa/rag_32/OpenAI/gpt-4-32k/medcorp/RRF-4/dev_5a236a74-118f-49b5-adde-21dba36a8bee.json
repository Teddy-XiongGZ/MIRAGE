    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that the iliac crest is a common source for bone grafts in alveolar cleft surgery. However, they do not specify whether the anterior or posterior iliac crest is used. Document 4 mentions that the graft was done by the same surgeon in all patients using bone from the iliac crest, but it does not specify which part of the iliac crest. Document 5 mentions that particulate bone graft from iliac crest demonstrated better results compared with block graft or mixed graft. Document 9 mentions that autogenous iliac crest bone graft was used in all cases. Document 15 mentions that the graft from the anterior iliac crest was used. Document 23 mentions that the iliac bone is a good source for bone graft. Document 28 mentions that the iliac crest bone graft had gained popularity. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the best graft for alveolar cleft surgery is likely to be from the iliac crest. However, since only one document specifically mentions the anterior iliac crest and none mention the posterior iliac crest, the anterior iliac crest is the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Anterior iliac crest\"}"
