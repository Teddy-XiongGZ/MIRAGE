    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for an infection that causes a non-centrally distributed rash. Looking at the documents, Document [0] mentions that the rash associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever may not be predominantly acral, or no rash may develop at all. However, this is not one of the options. Document [3] mentions that no child with a rash confined to the distribution of the superior vena cava had meningococcal infection, but this is also not one of the options. Document [12] mentions that shingles can reactivate presenting as zoster sine herpete: pain radiating along the path of a single spinal nerve (a dermatomal distribution), but without an accompanying rash. This is also not one of the options. Document [23] mentions Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) which is based on a circular 'bull's-eye' rash at the site of infection called erythema chronicum migrans, which is very similar to that seen in Lyme disease. However, this is also not one of the options. None of the documents mention the specific diseases in the options causing a non-centrally distributed rash.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
