    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Local anesthetics block nerve impulse transmission in a stepwise sequence depending on the concentration and volume of the local anesthetic. The block generally occurs in a stepwise sequence with autonomic impulses blocked first, then sensory impulses, and finally, motor impulses. Autonomic impulses are related to the regulation of body functions like heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, salivation, perspiration, etc. However, the question is asking about the first sensation to be lost, which falls under sensory impulses. Among the options provided, pain is the sensation that is most likely to be blocked first.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pain\"}"
