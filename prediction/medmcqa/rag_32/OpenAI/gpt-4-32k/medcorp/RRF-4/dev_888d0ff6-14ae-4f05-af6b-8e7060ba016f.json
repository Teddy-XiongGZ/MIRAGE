    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not mention any of the hormones listed in the options as being controlled by feedforward control. Feedforward control is a type of control system that responds to its control signal in a pre-defined way without responding to how the load reacts. It is different from feedback control, which adjusts the input to take account of how it affects the load.
