    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that an affected male does not have affected children, but an affected female always has affected children. This suggests that the inheritance pattern is X-linked, as males pass their X chromosome only to their daughters and not to their sons. If the male is affected, he would pass the affected X chromosome to his daughters, but since the question states that he does not have affected children, this suggests that the inheritance pattern is not X-linked recessive. On the other hand, if the female is affected, she would pass the affected X chromosome to both her sons and daughters. Since the question states that an affected female always has affected children, this suggests that the inheritance pattern is X-linked dominant. Therefore, the answer is X-linked dominant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
