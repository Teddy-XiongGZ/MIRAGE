    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"LSCS stands for Lower Segment Caesarean Section, which is a type of surgery performed during childbirth. The question is asking for a heart disease that would absolutely indicate the need for this type of surgery. Document [16] mentions LSCS but does not provide any information about heart diseases that would indicate the need for this surgery. Document [0] also mentions LSCS but in a different context, not related to heart diseases. None of the other documents seem to provide relevant information about heart diseases and LSCS. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it is not possible to determine which heart disease would be an absolute indication for LSCS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
