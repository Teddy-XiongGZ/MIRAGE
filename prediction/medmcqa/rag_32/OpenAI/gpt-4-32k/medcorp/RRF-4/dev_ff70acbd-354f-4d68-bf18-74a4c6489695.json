    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The base deficit is calculated using the formula: HCO3- (MEq) = 0,3 X body weight (kg) X delta base excess (mEq/l). The delta base excess is the difference between the normal bicarbonate concentration and the patient's bicarbonate concentration. The normal bicarbonate concentration is typically around 24 mEq/L. In this case, the patient's bicarbonate concentration is 6 mEq/L. Therefore, the delta base excess is 24 - 6 = 18 mEq/L. Substituting these values into the formula gives: HCO3- (MEq) = 0.3 X 75 kg X 18 mEq/L = 405 mEq. Therefore, the base deficit is approximately 400 mEq.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
