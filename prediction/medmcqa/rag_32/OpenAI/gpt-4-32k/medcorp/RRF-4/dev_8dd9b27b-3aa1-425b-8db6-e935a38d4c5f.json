    "First, I will look for information about each of the enzymes in the documents to see if thiamine is mentioned as a cofactor. 1. Alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase: Document [2] mentions that thiamine pyrophosphate, a derivative of thiamine, is required for the activity of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. So, thiamine is a cofactor for this enzyme. 2. Branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase: Document [15] also mentions that thiamine pyrophosphate is required for the activity of branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase. So, thiamine is a cofactor for this enzyme as well. 3. Succinate dehydrogenase: I couldn't find any document mentioning that thiamine is a cofactor for succinate dehydrogenase. 4. Pyruvate dehydrogenase: Document [0] mentions that thiamine diphosphate, another derivative of thiamine, is a cofactor required for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, a reaction catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase. So, thiamine is a cofactor for this enzyme. Based on this information, it seems that thiamine is a cofactor for alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, but not for succinate dehydrogenase. So, the answer is C. Succinate dehydrogenase.
