    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of repeated episodes of rheumatic fever and is hypersensitive to penicillin. Therefore, an alternative to penicillin needs to be prescribed. Document [25] mentions that oral cephalosporins are used as an alternative therapy for penicillin-allergic patients. However, none of the options provided are cephalosporins. Sulfisoxazole, mentioned in option B, is a sulfonamide antibiotic that can be used to treat different types of infections caused by bacteria. It is not typically used for rheumatic fever prophylaxis, but it could be an alternative in a patient allergic to penicillin. Sulfasalazine (option C) is primarily used for treating rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, not for preventing rheumatic fever. Streptomycin (option D) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used for treating tuberculosis and other serious infections, but it is not typically used for rheumatic fever prophylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
