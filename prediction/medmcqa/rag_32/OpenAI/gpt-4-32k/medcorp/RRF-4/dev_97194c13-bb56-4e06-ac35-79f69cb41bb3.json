    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], red blood cells (RBCs) are stored at 4\u00b0C, platelet concentrates (PCs) at 22\u00b0C or at 4\u00b0C, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at -80\u00b0C. Document [1] also mentions that platelets are stored at room temperature and fresh frozen plasma can remain stored at \u221218 C to \u221265 C. Therefore, the closest option is A, where RBCs are stored at 2-6\u00b0C, platelets at 20-22\u00b0C, and FFP at -30\u00b0C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
