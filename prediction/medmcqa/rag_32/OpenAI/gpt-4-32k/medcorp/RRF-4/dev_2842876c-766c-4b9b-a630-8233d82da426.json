    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include hypogonadism, failure to thrive, loss of taste, and inability to maintain stability. Hypogonadism is associated with a deficiency of sex hormones, as mentioned in Document [4]. Failure to thrive can be caused by various nutritional deficiencies. Loss of taste, or dysgeusia, is associated with zinc deficiency, as mentioned in Document [21]. However, the patient's inability to maintain stability is not directly linked to zinc deficiency. Instead, this symptom could be related to a deficiency of copper, which can cause neurological problems, as mentioned in Document [25]. Therefore, considering all the symptoms, the patient's condition is most likely due to a deficiency of copper.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Copper\"}"
