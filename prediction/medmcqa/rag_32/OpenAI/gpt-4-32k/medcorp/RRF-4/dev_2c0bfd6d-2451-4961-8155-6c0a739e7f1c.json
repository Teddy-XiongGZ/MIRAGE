    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each choice means. Choice A refers to the process of charging a tRNA molecule with its corresponding amino acid, which is indeed carried out by the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase as stated in Document [8]. So, choice A is true. Choice B refers to the structure of tRNA molecules. tRNA molecules are indeed composed of a single strand of RNA that folds back on itself to form several short, double-helical regions as stated in Document [24]. So, choice B is true. Choice C refers to the site of amino acid attachment on the tRNA molecule. The amino acid is indeed always attached to the 3' end of the tRNA molecule as stated in Document [4]. So, choice C is true. Choice D refers to the number of tRNA molecules corresponding to each amino acid. However, there are 20 amino acids, not 2. So, choice D is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
