    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case of a newborn infant of a diabetic mother who is experiencing seizures. The documents suggest that neonatal seizures in term infants can be associated with several factors, including hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, birth asphyxia, and intraventricular hemorrhage. However, Document [0] specifically mentions that hypoglycemia in infants of diabetic mothers is a known cause of neonatal seizures.

Therefore, hypoglycemia is the most likely cause of the seizures in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
