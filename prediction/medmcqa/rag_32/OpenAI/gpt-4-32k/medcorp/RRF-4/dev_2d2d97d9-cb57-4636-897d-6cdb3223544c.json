    "Based on the documents provided, the Curve of Wilson is described as the across arch curvature or posterior occlusal plane, defined by a line drawn from left mandibular first molar to right mandibular first molar (Document [9]). This curve is also characterized by a lingual incline in the mandibular posterior dentition (Document [8]). Therefore, the Curve of Wilson is the imaginary occlusal curve that contacts the buccal and lingual cusp tips of mandibular buccal teeth. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Curve of Wilson is described as the across arch curvature or posterior occlusal plane, defined by a line drawn from left mandibular first molar to right mandibular first molar.
