    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has rickets that is not responding to vitamin D, which is known as vitamin D refractory rickets. The normal levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone rule out conditions related to hyper or hypocalcemia, such as distal renal tubular acidosis and proximal renal tubular acidosis. The normal bicarbonate levels also make renal tubular acidosis less likely. The low phosphate level is a key feature of hypophosphatemic rickets. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is hypophosphatemic rickets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Hypophosphatemic rickets.\"}"
