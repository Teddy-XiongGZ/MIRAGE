    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the appropriate space maintainer for a 7-year-old patient who needs extraction of teeth 74 and 85. Tooth 74 is a maxillary right second primary molar and tooth 85 is a mandibular right second primary molar. The space maintainer should be chosen based on the location of the teeth to be extracted. A bilateral band and loop is typically used when there is a premature loss of primary first molar or primary second molar. A lingual arch is used when there is a premature loss of more than one tooth in the lower jaw. A Nance space maintainer is used when there is a premature loss of more than one tooth in the upper jaw. In this case, since the teeth to be extracted are in both the upper and lower jaw, a bilateral band and loop would be the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
