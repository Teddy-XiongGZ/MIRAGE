    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about the treatment of Juvenile Myoclonic epilepsy. Step 2: Document [0] mentions that \"Mono-therapy with valproate is the preferred treatment.\" This contradicts choice A, which states that Valproate is contraindicated. Step 3: Document [9] mentions that \"Lamotrigine and levetiracetam are alternative therapies for women of childbearing age.\" This supports choice B, which states that Lamotrigine can be given. Step 4: Document [18] mentions that \"In the presence of major seizures carbamazapine should be used with caution as it may exacerbate minor attacks.\" While this document does not mention Phenytoin specifically, it suggests that not all drugs are suitable for treating Juvenile Myoclonic epilepsy, which supports choice C, which states that Phenytoin is not the preferred drug. Step 5: Document [0] mentions that \"Several major genes for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have been identified, but these genes account for only a small proportions of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy cases, suggesting multifactorial or complex inheritance in most.\" This supports choice D, which states that Juvenile Myoclonic epilepsy has a polygenic inheritance. Based on these findings, the statement that is not true about Juvenile Myoclonic epilepsy is choice A: Valproate is contraindicated. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first looked for information about the treatment of Juvenile Myoclonic epilepsy. I found that Valproate is the preferred treatment, which contradicts choice A. I also found that Lamotrigine can be given as an alternative therapy, which supports choice B. While I didn't find specific information about Phenytoin, I found that not all drugs are suitable for treating this condition, which supports choice C. Finally, I found that Juvenile Myoclonic epilepsy has a polygenic inheritance, which supports choice D. Therefore, the statement that is not true is choice A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
