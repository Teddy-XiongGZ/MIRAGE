    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Unconjugated bilirubin is a product of the breakdown of red blood cells. It is transported to the liver, where it is converted into conjugated bilirubin and excreted in bile. Conditions that increase the breakdown of red blood cells or impair the liver's ability to convert unconjugated bilirubin into conjugated bilirubin can lead to an increase in unconjugated bilirubin. Crigler Najjar syndrome and Gilbert syndrome are both genetic disorders that impair the liver's ability to conjugate bilirubin, leading to an increase in unconjugated bilirubin. Hemolytic anemia is a condition that increases the breakdown of red blood cells, leading to an increase in unconjugated bilirubin. On the other hand, Dubin Johnson syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder that impairs the ability of liver cells to secrete conjugated bilirubin into bile. This leads to an increase in conjugated, not unconjugated, bilirubin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dubin Johnson syndrome\"}"
