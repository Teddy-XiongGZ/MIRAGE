    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment for a mandible fracture where the mandibular height is 8 mm. Document [0] mentions that fractures in a mandible measuring more than 10 mm in the vertical height were treated with one miniplate. Fractures in an extremely atrophic mandible with 10 mm or less were treated using one or two miniplates, also using a modified Champy plate with 1.3 mm in thickness. Document [13] also mentions that four 6-mm dental implants inserted in an extremely resorbed edentulous mandible provided a solid basis for a bar-retained overdenture. Therefore, the answer should be Champy's plate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
