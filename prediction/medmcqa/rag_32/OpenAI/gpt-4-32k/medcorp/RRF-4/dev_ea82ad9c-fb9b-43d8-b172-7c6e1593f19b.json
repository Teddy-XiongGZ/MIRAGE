    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eugenol is a key component of zinc oxide eugenol cement, as mentioned in multiple documents. However, there are instances where eugenol may need to be replaced due to its potential adverse effects, such as allergic reactions or incompatibility with certain resin materials. Document [5] mentions that non-eugenol materials use long chain aliphatic acids or aryl-substituted butyric acid to react with zinc oxide particles. However, none of the options provided in the question match these descriptions. Therefore, I need to look for more information. Document [7] mentions non-eugenol cements replace eugenol with several types of carboxylic acids, but again, the specific acids mentioned in the question are not listed. Document [0] mentions that cements containing ethoxy benzoic acid (EBA) have been developed as an alternative to traditional zinc oxide-eugenol cements. This seems to match with option D, Ortho-ethoxy acid, which could be another name for ethoxy benzoic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
