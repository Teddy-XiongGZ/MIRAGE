    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate is a step in the glycolysis pathway. According to Document [2], this conversion is an isomerization, which means it involves the rearrangement of atoms within the molecule. This is also confirmed in Document [8] and Document [15]. Therefore, the correct answer is isomerisation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
