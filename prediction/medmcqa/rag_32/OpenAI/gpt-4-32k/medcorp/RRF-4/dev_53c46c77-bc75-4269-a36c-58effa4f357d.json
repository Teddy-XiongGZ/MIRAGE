    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a high caries index, which means they are at a high risk of tooth decay. Therefore, the crown material should be durable and resistant to decay. Metal ceramic crowns are known for their strength and durability, making them a good choice for patients with a high caries index. On the other hand, the patient has minimum horizontal overlap of maxillary central incisors, which means the teeth do not overlap much horizontally. This could make it difficult to fit a full crown, such as a metal ceramic crown or a porcelain jacket crown. A three fourth crown, which covers three of the four walls of the tooth, might be a better fit for this patient. Aluminium crowns are not typically used for permanent restorations due to their lack of strength and aesthetics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Three fourth crown\"}"
