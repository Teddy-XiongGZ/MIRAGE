    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the difference between RIFLE and KDIGO criteria in differentiating a tubular injury. However, none of the documents provided give a direct comparison of these two criteria in terms of differentiating a tubular injury. Both RIFLE and KDIGO are classification systems for acute kidney injury (AKI) and they rely on changes in serum creatinine and urine output, not on specific markers of tubular injury. Therefore, none of the answer choices provided (Uosm, Urinary Na, Urinary NGAL, FeNa) are directly related to the RIFLE or KDIGO criteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
