    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the legal responsibility of the doctor in a case where a patient developed osteomyelitis after not following the doctor's advice for regular wound dressing. The 'Last clear chance' doctrine is a legal concept that could hold a person liable if they had the last opportunity to avoid an accident but failed to do so. In this case, the doctor gave the patient advice to get regular dressing of his wound, so this doctrine doesn't apply. 'Contributory negligence' refers to a situation where the injured person is partially responsible for their own injury. In this case, the patient didn't follow the doctor's advice, so this could apply. 'Avoidable negligence' would imply that the doctor could have avoided the situation, but in this case, the doctor gave the correct advice which the patient didn't follow. The doctor prescribing wrong medicines is not mentioned in the scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
