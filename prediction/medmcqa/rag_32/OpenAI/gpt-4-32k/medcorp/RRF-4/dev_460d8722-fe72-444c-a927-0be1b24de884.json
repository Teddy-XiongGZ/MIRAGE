    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The adrenal medulla is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5\u2013T11, as stated in Document [5]. This means that the adrenal medulla does have nerve supply, ruling out option D. Document [15] and Document [20] also mention that the adrenal medulla is responsible for the production of catecholamines, which is stimulated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, ruling out option A. Document [13] and Document [15] mention that the adrenal cortex also has a role in hormone production, but none of the documents provided information about its nerve supply. However, it is generally known that the adrenal cortex is regulated by hormones rather than direct innervation, which makes option C the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
