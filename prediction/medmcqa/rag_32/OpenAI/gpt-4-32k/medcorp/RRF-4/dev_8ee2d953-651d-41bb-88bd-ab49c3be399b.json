    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Addison's disease is a disorder that occurs when the body produces insufficient amounts of certain hormones produced by the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located just above the kidneys. They consist of two parts: the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex produces hormones that are vital to life, such as cortisol (which helps regulate metabolism and helps the body respond to stress) and aldosterone (which helps control blood pressure). The adrenal medulla, the inner part, is not essential to life, but helps the body cope with physical and emotional stress. It produces nonessential (that is, you don't need them to live) hormones, such as adrenaline (which helps the body react to stress). From the documents, it is clear that Addison's disease is related to problems with the adrenal cortex, not the adrenal medulla, post pituitary, or parathyroid gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
