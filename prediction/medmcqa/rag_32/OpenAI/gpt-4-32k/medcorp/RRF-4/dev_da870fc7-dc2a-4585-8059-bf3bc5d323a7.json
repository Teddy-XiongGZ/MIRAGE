    "The positive predictive value (PPV) is defined as the proportion of persons who test positive that actually have the disease. According to Document [7], the formula for PPV is: Positive Predictive Value=(True Positives (A))/(True Positives (A)+False Positives (B)). This means that the denominator for the calculation of the positive predictive value of a screening test is comprised of True Positives + False Positives. So, the answer is C. True+ves + False+ves. { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The positive predictive value is calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false positives. This is clearly stated in Document [7].\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
