    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The respiratory centre is stimulated by changes in levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and blood pH. An increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood stimulates the respiratory centres to increase the rate and depth of breathing to expel the excess carbon dioxide. Therefore, an increase in arterial carbon dioxide level would be a strong stimulator of the respiratory centre.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increase in arterial carbon dioxide level\"}"
