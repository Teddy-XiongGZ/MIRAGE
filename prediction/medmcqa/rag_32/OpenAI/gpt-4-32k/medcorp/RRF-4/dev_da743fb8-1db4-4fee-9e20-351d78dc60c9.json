The presence of 3+ proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin 2.5 gm/L) further supports this diagnosis. The absence of RBCs, WBCs, and casts in the urine rules out nephritic syndrome and interstitial nephritis. Among the choices, both Minimal Change Disease and Membranous Nephropathy are types of nephrotic syndrome.
