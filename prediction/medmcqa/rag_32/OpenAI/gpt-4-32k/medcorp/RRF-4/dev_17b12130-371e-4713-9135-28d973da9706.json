According to these documents, the inferior oblique muscle is responsible for extorsion, elevation (upward rotation), and abduction (outward rotation) of the eye. Step 3: Compare the functions listed in the documents with the options given in the question. The functions listed in the documents match with options B (Lateral rotation), C (Extorsion), and D (Upward rotation). Therefore, these are not the correct answers. Step 4: The remaining option is A (Downward rotation), which is not listed as a function of the inferior oblique muscle in the documents. Therefore, this is the correct answer. Based on these steps, the answer is A (Downward rotation).
