    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Real Time PCR is a method used to quantify the viral load in a patient's body. This is useful in monitoring the progression of a disease and the effectiveness of treatment. Looking at the options, Hepatitis B, BK virus in renal transplant patients, and CMV in liver transplant patients are all conditions where monitoring the viral load can be crucial for treatment decisions. However, in the case of HSV causing temporal encephalitis, while PCR can be used to confirm the presence of the virus, the viral load does not typically play a role in the management or prognosis of the disease. Therefore, the viral load done by Real Time PCR is of no role in investigative procedures for HSV causing temporal encephalitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
