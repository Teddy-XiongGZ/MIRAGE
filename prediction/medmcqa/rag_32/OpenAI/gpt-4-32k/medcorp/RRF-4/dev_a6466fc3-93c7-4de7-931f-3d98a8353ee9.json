    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ewing's sarcoma is characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation t(11;22). This translocation can be detected using various methods. Conventional karyotyping can detect chromosomal translocations, but it is not the most sensitive or specific method. Next generation sequencing is a powerful tool for detecting genetic alterations, but it may not be the most practical or cost-effective method for detecting a known translocation. PCR can also detect this translocation, but it requires prior knowledge of the exact sequences involved in the translocation. FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) is a method that can detect specific chromosomal translocations and is commonly used in the diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma, as mentioned in multiple documents such as Document [1], Document [14], Document [20], and Document [25]. Therefore, FISH would be the best method to detect translocation t(11;22) in this malignancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
