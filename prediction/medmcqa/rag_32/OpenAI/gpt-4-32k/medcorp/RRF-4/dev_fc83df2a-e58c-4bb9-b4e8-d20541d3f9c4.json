    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the minimum sample size required for a study where the expected disease prevalence is 50% and the investigator wants a confidence interval of 45% to 55% with 95% confidence. This is a question about sample size determination for prevalence studies. According to Document [20], the sample size for binomial proportions can be calculated using the formula n = (1.96^2) / (W/2)^2, where W is the width of the confidence interval. In this case, W = 55% - 45% = 10%, so W/2 = 5%. Substituting these values into the formula gives n = (1.96^2) / (0.05^2) = 384.16. Since sample sizes must be integers and must lie on or above the calculated minimum, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 385. Therefore, the closest answer choice to 385 is 400.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
