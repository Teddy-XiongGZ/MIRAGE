    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a rule that states a person is not criminally responsible for his actions if, due to unsoundness of mind, he is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing something wrong or against the law. Looking at the documents, the McNaughten rule is mentioned several times in relation to this concept. For example, in Document [20], it states that the McNaughten Rules establish a defense on the ground of insanity, and it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. This matches the description in the question. The other options, Curren's rule, Durham's rule, and the Irresistible impulse test, are not mentioned in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
