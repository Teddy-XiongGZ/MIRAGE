    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several types of Gracey curettes. Document 0 mentions #11/12 and #7/8 Gracey curettes. Document 1 mentions Gracey curettes no. 1-2. However, there is no mention of #13-14 or #5-16 Gracey curettes in any of the documents. Therefore, one of these must be the correct answer. Since the question asks for a type of Gracey curette that does not exist, and there is no evidence in the documents to suggest that #13-14 or #5-16 Gracey curettes exist, either could be the correct answer. However, since only one answer can be chosen, I will choose the one that seems less likely to exist based on the numbering pattern of the mentioned Gracey curettes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. # 5-16\"}"
