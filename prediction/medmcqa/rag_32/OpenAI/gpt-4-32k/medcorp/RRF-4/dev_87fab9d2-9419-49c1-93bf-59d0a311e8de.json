    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and doesn't want to take injectable insulin. Therefore, we need to find an oral hypoglycemic agent that doesn't require renal dose modification. According to Document [6], Repaglinide is recommended in these patients, but it doesn't specify if it requires dose adjustment. Document [5] mentions that Repaglinide is an attractive therapeutic option even in the dialysis population, but it doesn't clarify if it requires dose adjustment. Document [8] suggests that only insulin and repaglinide can be recommended in severe CKD, but again, it doesn't specify if dose adjustment is needed. Document [6] also mentions that Linagliptin does not require dose adjustment. Therefore, based on the available documents, Linagliptin seems to be the best choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
