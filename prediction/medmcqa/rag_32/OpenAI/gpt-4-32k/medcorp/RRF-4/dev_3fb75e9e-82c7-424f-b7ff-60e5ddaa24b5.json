    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The speed of induction of an inhalational agent is determined by its blood gas solubility. The lower the blood gas solubility, the faster the induction. This is because a lower solubility means the agent is less likely to dissolve in the blood and more likely to remain in the gas phase, allowing it to reach the brain more quickly. Therefore, an agent with high blood gas solubility would not lead to faster induction. Nitrous oxide is known to improve the blood concentrations of other volatile inhalation agents, leading to faster induction. An increased residual volume or a right to left shunt would not directly affect the speed of induction of an inhalational agent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
