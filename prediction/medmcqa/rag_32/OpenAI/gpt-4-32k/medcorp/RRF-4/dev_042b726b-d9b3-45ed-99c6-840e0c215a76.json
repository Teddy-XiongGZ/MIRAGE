    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a complication of rheumatic fever that affects the heart valves. According to Document [0], patients with RHD have a higher incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis. Document [19] also mentions that RHD predominantly affects the valvular endocardium. The endocardium is the innermost layer of the heart, lining the heart chambers and covering the heart valves. Therefore, in endocarditis of RHD, the site of the lesion would be on the valves. However, to specify the exact location on the valves, we need to understand the anatomy of the heart valves. Heart valves consist of cusps or leaflets, which open and close to regulate blood flow. The line of closure of the valves is where the cusps meet when the valve is closed. The free margins of the valves are the edges of the cusps, which are the parts of the valve that come into direct contact with the blood flow. Both sides of the valves refer to the atrial and ventricular sides of the valve. Given this information, the site of lesion in endocarditis of RHD is most likely along the line of closure of the valves, as this is where the valve cusps meet and where damage from the inflammatory process of endocarditis would most likely occur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
