    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Model plaster is also known as plaster of Paris. According to Document [5], plaster of Paris is used in the field of medicine, dentistry and rehabilitation. Document [12] also mentions that plaster is used for mounting casts or models of oral tissues in dentistry. The main component of plaster of Paris is gypsum. According to Document [3], gypsum is used for casting moulds and modeling. Therefore, we need to find the chemical formula for gypsum. Document [2] states that the most common types of plaster mainly contain gypsum. The plaster is manufactured as a dry powder and is mixed with water to form a stiff but workable paste immediately before it is applied to the surface. The reaction with water liberates heat through crystallization and the hydrated plaster then hardens. This suggests that the plaster is a hydrated form of gypsum. Therefore, the chemical formula for gypsum is the one that includes water molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. CaSO4 \u2022 2H2O\"}"
