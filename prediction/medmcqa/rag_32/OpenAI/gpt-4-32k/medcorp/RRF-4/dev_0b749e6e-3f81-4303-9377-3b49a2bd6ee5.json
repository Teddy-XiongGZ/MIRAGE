    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that a lack of vitamin A can cause a reduction in the amount of enamel formation. Document [1] also supports this by stating that Vitamin A deficiency (A-) is known to cause morphologic changes in tooth structures, including altered dentine and pulp, but the enamel organ was unremarkable in the 4-week deficient period. Document [7] also mentions that a lower intake of vitamin A has been associated with decreased oral epithelial development, impaired tooth formation, enamel hypoplasia and periodontitis. Document [16] also mentions that Vitamin A deficiency imposed during an eight-day in vitro period caused effects very similar to those of vitamin A deficiency imposed on rats in vivo, including aberrant dentin matrix, cessation of dentin production, and finally overall structural collapse with loss of normal morphology. However, the most direct impact seems to be on enamel formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
