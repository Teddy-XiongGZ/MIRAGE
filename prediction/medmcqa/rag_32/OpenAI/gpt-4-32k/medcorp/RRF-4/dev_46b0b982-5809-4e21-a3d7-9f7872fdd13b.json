    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bennett's movement, or lateral shift, is a term used to describe the movement of the mandible, or jawbone, during lateral jaw movements. According to the documents, this movement is characterized by a downward, forward, and inward movement of the condyle on the non-working side, and a simultaneous rotation of the working side condyle. This movement can influence the position of the teeth. Document 15 discusses how changes in articular parameters, which include Bennett's movement, can influence tooth morphology. Therefore, it can be inferred that Bennett's movement can influence the position of the teeth. However, the documents do not specify whether this influence is on the faciolingual or mesiodistal position of the teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of the above\"}"
