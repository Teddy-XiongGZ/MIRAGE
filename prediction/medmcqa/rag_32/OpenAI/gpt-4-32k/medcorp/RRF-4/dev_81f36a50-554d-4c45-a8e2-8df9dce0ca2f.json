    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Substrate-level phosphorylation is a metabolic reaction that results in the production of ATP or GTP. The citric acid cycle is a key metabolic pathway that involves substrate-level phosphorylation. According to the documents, in the citric acid cycle, succinate thiokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of guanosine diphosphate (GDP), producing GTP. Therefore, the high energy phosphate compound formed in the citric acid cycle through substrate-level phosphorylation is GTP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. GTP\"}"
