    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The interosseous anterior syndrome is a rare nerve compression syndrome that concerns only the motor branch of the median nerve. It is evidenced by paralysis of the M. flexor pollicis longus and M. flexor digitorum profundus II with weakness of flexion of the terminal joint of the thumb and index finger but without sensory loss. The flexor pollicis longus is responsible for flexion of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. Therefore, the loss of flexion in the interphalangeal joint of the thumb in a supracondylar fracture is due to the involvement of the anterior interosseous nerve, which is a branch of the median nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
