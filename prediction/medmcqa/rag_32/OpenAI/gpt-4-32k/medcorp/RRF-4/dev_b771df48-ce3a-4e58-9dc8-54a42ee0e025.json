    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Continuous variables are those that can take on an uncountable set of values, as stated in Document [0]. Height in cms (Choice A) and weight in kg (Choice B) can take on any value within a certain range, so they are continuous. Age in years and months (Choice D) can also take on any value within a certain range, so it is also continuous. However, blood groups A, B, ABO (Choice C) can only take on a limited, fixed number of possible values, as stated in Document [9]. Therefore, blood groups A, B, ABO is a categorical variable, not a continuous variable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
