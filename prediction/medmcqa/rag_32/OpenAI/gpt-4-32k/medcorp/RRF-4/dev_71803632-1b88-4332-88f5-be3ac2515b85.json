    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Looking at the documents, PAX-6 is mentioned in Document 18 as a gene coding for transcription proteins related to cataracts. CRYGS-3 is not mentioned in any of the documents. LMX-IB is also not mentioned in any of the documents. PITX-3 is mentioned in Document 0, Document 24, and Document 31 as a gene associated with congenital cataracts. Therefore, both PAX-6 and PITX-3 are mentioned as genes associated with congenital cataracts. However, PITX-3 is mentioned more frequently across the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. PITX-3\"}"
