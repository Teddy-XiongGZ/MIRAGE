    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mechanical properties of a material are influenced by the rate of loading. According to Document 1, the compressive strength, strain at fracture, and toughness of bovine cortical bone increased as the loading rate increased, under certain conditions. However, these properties showed no significant changes when the loading rates were faster than the corresponding critical loading rates. This suggests that if the rate of loading is decreased, the mechanical properties of the material may decrease. However, this can depend on the specific material and the range of loading rates being considered.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Decreases\"}"
