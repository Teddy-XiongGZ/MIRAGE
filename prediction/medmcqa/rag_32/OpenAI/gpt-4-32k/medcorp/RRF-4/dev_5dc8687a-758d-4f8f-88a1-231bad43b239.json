    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Compressive strength refers to the ability of a material to resist forces that can reduce its size, while tensile strength refers to the ability of a material to resist forces that can elongate it. A material with high compressive strength and low tensile strength would be strong when compressed but weak when stretched or pulled. This is a characteristic of brittle materials, which can withstand compression but are likely to break or crack under tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
