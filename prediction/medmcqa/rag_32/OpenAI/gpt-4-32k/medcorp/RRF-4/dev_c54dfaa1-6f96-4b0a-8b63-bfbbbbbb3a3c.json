    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by the presence of macro-ovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils, as stated in Document [0]. Therefore, these two options are not the correct answer. Howell-Jolly bodies are not mentioned in the context of megaloblastic anemia in any of the provided documents, but they are typically associated with other conditions such as asplenia, so this could be a potential answer. However, Document [2] mentions that reticulocytosis is not typically seen in megaloblastic anemia, but rather in conditions like hemolytic anemia and acute hemorrhage. Therefore, reticulocytosis is the most accurate answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
