    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Posselt's diagram, also known as Posselt's envelope of motion, is a representation of the range of motion of the lower jaw bone, or mandible. It shows the maximum movement of the jaw in three planes: sagittal, horizontal, and frontal. This includes movements such as maximum protrusion, where the lower jaw is pushed forward as far as possible, and translation, where the jaw opens wider due to a secondary gliding movement. Therefore, the diagram indicates the motion of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
