    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking about the characteristics of antigenic drift. Step 2: Review the documents. From Document [0], we learn that antigenic drift is a common way that influenza viruses change and it's dependent on the duration of the epidemic and the strength of host immunity. Document [4] explains that antigenic drift is a kind of genetic variation in viruses, arising from the accumulation of mutations in the virus genes that code for virus-surface proteins that host antibodies recognize. Document [14] mentions that antigenic drift allows for evasion of host immune systems by small mutations in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes that make the protein unrecognizable to pre-existing host immunity. Document [15] explains that viral genomes are constantly mutating, producing new forms of these antigens. If one of these new forms of an antigen is sufficiently different from the old antigen, it will no longer bind to the antibodies or immune-cell receptors, allowing the mutant virus to infect people who were immune to the original strain of the virus because of prior infection or vaccination. Step 3: Match the information from the documents to the answer choices. None of the documents suggest that antigenic drift is seen only in influenza virus type A (Choice A), is a result of frameshift mutation (Choice B), or mostly affects the matrix protein (Choices C and D). However, the documents do suggest that antigenic drift is a result of mutations in the virus genes that code for virus-surface proteins that host antibodies recognize, which is not listed as an answer choice. Step 4: Since none of the answer choices match the information from the documents, it seems there may be an error in the question or answer choices.
