    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) guidelines suggest that if a patient has symptoms suggestive of TB but the sputum smear is negative, further diagnostic tests should be performed. According to Document [3], if a patient has a negative AFB smear but the chest X-ray is suggestive and the Mantoux test is positive, it is considered a probable case. However, the document does not specify the next step in this scenario. Document [18] suggests that if cough continues in patients with negative smears and normal/minimally abnormal chest X-rays, patients should return for further follow-up with sputum smear examination and chest radiography. However, this does not provide a clear answer to the question. Document [27] suggests that if a patient has a negative sputum smear but a chest X-ray suggestive of TB, the patient should be given a second course of antibiotics. If the cough improves, the patient can be advised not to return for further follow-up. If the cough continues, the patient should return for further follow-up with sputum smear examination and chest radiography. However, this still does not provide a clear answer to the question. Document [30] suggests that in patients with a negative sputum smear but a chest X-ray suggestive of TB, the patient should be given a second course of antibiotics and if the cough continues, the patient should return for further follow-up with sputum smear examination and chest radiography. However, this still does not provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, based on the available documents, it is not clear what the next step should be according to the RNTCP in a patient with a negative sputum AFB smear but a chest X-ray suggestive of TB.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
