    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Habits are often formed subconsciously and are repeated regularly, as stated in Document [1]. They can be influenced by psychological factors, as mentioned in Document [2], where oral habits are described as psychodynamic phenomena. However, the question asks for a habit developed under a psychological cause. This would imply that the habit is not formed unintentionally, but rather as a response to a psychological need or issue. Therefore, unintentional habits (Choice B) would not fit this description. Similarly, the usefulness of a habit (Choice C) is not necessarily related to its psychological cause. Non-compulsive habits (Choice A) could potentially be formed under a psychological cause, but the term 'non-compulsive' does not inherently imply a psychological cause. On the other hand, intentional habits (Choice D) suggest a level of conscious decision-making and could be formed as a response to a psychological cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
