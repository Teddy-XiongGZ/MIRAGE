    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include poor naming and repetition, but unaffected comprehension, fluency, and understanding of written words. Broca's aphasia (Choice B) is characterized by non-fluent speech and impaired repetition, but comprehension is usually intact. This does not fully match the patient's symptoms as his fluency is unaffected. Transcortical sensory aphasia (Choice C) is characterized by fluent speech, impaired comprehension, and good repetition, which does not match the patient's symptoms. Conduction aphasia (Choice D) is characterized by good comprehension and fluency, but poor repetition, which matches some of the patient's symptoms but not the difficulty with naming. Anomic aphasia (Choice A), as described in Document 1, is characterized by difficulty in naming, but preserved comprehension, fluency, and repetition. This most closely matches the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
