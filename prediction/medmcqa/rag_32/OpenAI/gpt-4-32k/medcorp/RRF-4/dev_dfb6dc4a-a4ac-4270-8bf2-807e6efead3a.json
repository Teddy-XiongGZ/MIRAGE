    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Warfarin is known to cross the placenta and can cause fetotoxicity, especially during the first trimester due to its ability to interfere with organogenesis. This is referred to as warfarin embryopathy. Therefore, it is generally advised to avoid warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy. Heparin, on the other hand, does not cross the placenta and is considered safer for the fetus. Therefore, it is often recommended to replace warfarin with heparin during the first trimester. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is a type of heparin that is often used in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Replace warfarin with heparin in First trimester\"}"
