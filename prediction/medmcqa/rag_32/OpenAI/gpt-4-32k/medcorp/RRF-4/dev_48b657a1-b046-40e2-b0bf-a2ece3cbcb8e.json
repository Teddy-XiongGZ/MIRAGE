    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman is under 35 years old, but she already has a child with Down syndrome, which increases her risk of having another child with the same condition. Therefore, simply assuring her that there is no chance based on her age would not be accurate or ethical. A blood test or ultrasound (USG) can be used as screening methods to estimate the risk of Down syndrome, but they cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is an invasive diagnostic test that can provide a definitive diagnosis by analyzing the chromosomes in cells from the placenta. Given the woman's history and her desire to know her chances of having another child with Down syndrome, CVS would be the most appropriate test to recommend.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
