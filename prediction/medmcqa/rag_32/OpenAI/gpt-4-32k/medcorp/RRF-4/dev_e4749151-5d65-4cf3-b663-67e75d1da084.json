    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question provides information about a young male with loose motions and intermittent abdominal pain for the past year. The stool sample shows the presence of multiple ova that are more than 100u in diameter. The question asks which organism is not a likely cause of these symptoms. Fasciola gigantica, Gastrodiscoides hominis, and Echinostoma ilocanum are all parasites that produce large eggs and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms. However, Opisthorchis viverrini produces small eggs, typically around 30u in diameter. Therefore, it is not likely to be the cause of the symptoms in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
