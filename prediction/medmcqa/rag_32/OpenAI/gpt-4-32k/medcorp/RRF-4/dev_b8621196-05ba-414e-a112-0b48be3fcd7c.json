    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of diuretic that can be used in mild to moderate hypertension. From the documents, Document [3] mentions that diuretics are the drug of first choice in mild to moderately severe essential hypertension. Document [11] also mentions that low-dose oral formulations of diuretics constitute effective once-daily monopharmacotherapies for mild-to-moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension. Document [21] also mentions diuretics as a treatment for symptomatic cardiac failure on effort, which is a condition related to hypertension. However, the specific type of diuretic is not mentioned in these documents. Document [18] mentions that metolazone, a thiazide diuretic, remains active even when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 30\u201340 mL/min, which gives it a considerable advantage over other thiazide diuretics, since renal and heart failure often coexist and contribute to fluid retention. This suggests that thiazide diuretics can be used in conditions related to hypertension. Document [21] also mentions thiazide diuretics as a treatment for congestive heart failure, which is a condition related to hypertension. Therefore, the answer is thiazide diuretic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
