    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most important prognosis factor for death in a child with active liver failure. From the documents, it is clear that there are several factors that can influence the prognosis of a child with liver failure. These include increasing transaminases, increasing bilirubin, increasing prothrombin time, and Gram (-)ve sepsis. However, Document 23 specifically mentions that entry blood ammonia was the only independent factor significantly associated with mortality. This suggests that while all the factors listed in the options can influence prognosis, they may not be the most important. However, the option related to blood ammonia is not provided in the choices. Among the provided choices, Document 18 mentions that prothrombin time and encephalopathy were the most significant parameters suggesting a high likelihood of death. Therefore, increasing prothrombin time seems to be the most important prognosis factor for death among the provided choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
