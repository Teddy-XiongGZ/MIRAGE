    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the height of contour of the maxillary canine in comparison to the maxillary central incisor. The height of contour refers to the greatest bulge or widest point of a tooth. Document [0] provides information about the width-to-height ratios of the central incisor and canine, but it does not directly compare their heights of contour. Document [1] describes the maxillary central incisor, but does not compare it to the maxillary canine. Document [2] describes the maxillary canine, but does not compare its height of contour to the maxillary central incisor. Document [20] compares the maxillary canine and central incisor, but it focuses on their perceived width ratios and width-to-height ratios, not their heights of contour. None of the documents provide a direct comparison of the heights of contour of the maxillary central incisor and maxillary canine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Different on different teeth\"}"
