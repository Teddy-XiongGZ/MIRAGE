    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is involved in jaw dislocation. The muscles involved in jaw movement include the masseter, temporalis, medial pterygoid, and lateral pterygoid. The lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for opening the jaw. According to Document [0], the spasm of the lateral pterygoid muscle can result in trismus (locked jaw), and it plays a role in causing anterior dislocation of the disk. Document [9] also mentions that the lateral pterygoid muscle is chiefly responsible for dislocating the mandibular condyle and articular disc, causing the patient great pain and distress. Therefore, the lateral pterygoid muscle is the one that, when in spasm or excessive contraction, can lead to displacement of the articular disc beyond the articular tubercle of the TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lateral pterygoid\"}"
