    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is pregnant and has a history of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. She is currently taking sodium valproate. However, sodium valproate is known to have teratogenic effects and is generally not recommended for use in pregnant women or women of childbearing age. Therefore, it would be advisable to switch her to a different anti-epileptic drug. Carbamazepine is not recommended for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy as it may aggravate the condition. Lamotrigine is a safer alternative in pregnancy and is effective in treating juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. However, it should be noted that switching medications should be done gradually to avoid triggering seizures. Therefore, the best option would be to gradually taper off valproate and start lamotrigine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
