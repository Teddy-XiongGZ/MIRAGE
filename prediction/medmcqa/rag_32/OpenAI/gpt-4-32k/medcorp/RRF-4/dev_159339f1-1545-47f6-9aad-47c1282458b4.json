    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the incorrect statement about Class-II inlay gingival margins preparation. Document [0] mentions that the gingival opening of a two-surface cast restoration after cementation is minimized by the use of a preparation with proximal grooves. Document [1] discusses the marginal integrity of three different Class II restorative techniques but does not mention anything about the removal of weak enamel rods, increased metal burnishability, lap sliding fit of metal margin, or margins of restoration in a self-cleansable area. Document [3] talks about a protocol for class-II preparations with demineralized gingival margins for the improvement of the longevity of restorations, but it does not mention anything about the removal of weak enamel rods, increased metal burnishability, lap sliding fit of metal margin, or margins of restoration in a self-cleansable area. Document [4] discusses the accuracy of composite inlays fabricated with three different techniques and recommends the direct method if proximal contours and contact can be adequately controlled. It does not mention anything about the removal of weak enamel rods, increased metal burnishability, lap sliding fit of metal margin, or margins of restoration in a self-cleansable area. Document [7] discusses the effect of deep margin elevation on structural and marginal integrity of ceramic inlays. It does not mention anything about the removal of weak enamel rods, increased metal burnishability, lap sliding fit of metal margin, or margins of restoration in a self-cleansable area. After reviewing all the documents, it can be concluded that the statement 'Increased metal burnishability' is not mentioned in any of the documents and hence can be considered as the incorrect statement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
