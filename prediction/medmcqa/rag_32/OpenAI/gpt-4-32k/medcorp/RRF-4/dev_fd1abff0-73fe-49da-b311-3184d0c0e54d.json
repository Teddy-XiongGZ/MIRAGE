    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which test should not be done for a patient presenting with altered sensorium. Altered sensorium can be caused by a variety of conditions, including metabolic disorders, neurological conditions, and trauma. Complete blood counts (CBC) can help identify infections or other hematological conditions that might be causing the altered sensorium. Random blood sugar is important to rule out hypoglycemia, a common cause of altered sensorium as mentioned in Document [0]. A non-contrast CT head, as mentioned in Document [2], is important to rule out any brain injury or other neurological conditions. A lumbar puncture, while useful in certain cases such as suspected meningitis, is not a routine test for all patients presenting with altered sensorium. Therefore, it should not be done unless there is a specific indication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
