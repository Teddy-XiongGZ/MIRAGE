    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lead poisoning inhibits some enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. According to Document [0], Document [1], Document [2], and Document [30], one of the enzymes inhibited by lead is delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid, which is a precursor in the heme pathway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Delta amino levulinic acid\"}"
