    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old female with normal pubic hair and breast development, but she has primary amenorrhea. This means she has not started menstruating by the age of 16, which is later than expected. Her karyotype is normal, which means she does not have a chromosomal disorder. Turner syndrome and Kallmann syndrome are both chromosomal disorders, so they can be ruled out. Testicular feminization, also known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, is characterized by a male karyotype (46, XY) but a female phenotype, which is not the case here. Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, is a condition in which the mullerian ducts fail to develop properly, leading to underdeveloped or absent uterus and upper part of the vagina, while the external genitalia appear normal. This could explain the primary amenorrhea in a female with normal development of secondary sexual characteristics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
