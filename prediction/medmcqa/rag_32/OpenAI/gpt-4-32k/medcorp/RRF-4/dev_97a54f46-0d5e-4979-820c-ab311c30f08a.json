    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the muscles. This is achieved by increasing the stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each beat. Stroke volume is calculated as the difference between end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV). Therefore, to increase stroke volume, the heart can either increase EDV, decrease ESV, or both. According to Document [26], during early exercise, end-diastolic and stroke volumes increase, with no change in end-systolic volume. With further exercise, end-diastolic volume remains unchanged as end-systolic volume decreases. At peak exercise, end-diastolic volume decreases to resting level, stroke volume remains at a plateau, and end-systolic volume further decreases. This suggests that during exercise, the ESV decreases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
