    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it's asking. The question is asking for the statement that is NOT true about trauma from occlusion. Step 2: Review each choice in relation to the documents provided. Choice A: Trauma to Marginalized gingiva - Document [0] mentions that occlusal trauma can cause damage to teeth and their supporting structures, which could include the gingiva. Choice B: Reversible - Document [13] mentions that to treat mobility due to primary occlusal trauma, the cause of the trauma must be eliminated, suggesting that the effects of occlusal trauma can be reversed or mitigated. Choice C: Reduction in height of alveolar crest - Document [0] mentions that occlusal trauma may cause a thickening of the cervical margin of the alveolar bone, which could potentially lead to a reduction in the height of the alveolar crest. Choice D: No pocket - Document [4] mentions that teeth with occlusal trauma were caries-free and had no pocket formation. This suggests that occlusal trauma does not necessarily lead to pocket formation. Step 3: Based on the information from the documents, the statement that is NOT true about trauma from occlusion is Choice D: No pocket. While occlusal trauma may not necessarily lead to pocket formation, it does not mean that it cannot cause pocket formation. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each choice in relation to the documents provided. Based on the information from the documents, the statement that is NOT true about trauma from occlusion is Choice D: No pocket. While occlusal trauma may not necessarily lead to pocket formation, it does not mean that it cannot cause pocket formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
