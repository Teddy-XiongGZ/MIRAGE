    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The nucleus ambiguus is mentioned in Document [3] as being involved in parasympathetic cardiac regulation and contains vagal efferent neurons that inhibit the heart rate. Document [11] also mentions that the nucleus ambiguus contains cardiac vagal preganglionic somata that are organized for differential cardiac control. Document [22] also mentions that the nucleus ambiguus is a target site for the inhibition of baroreflex vagal bradycardia. Therefore, the nucleus ambiguus has a cardio inhibitory function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
