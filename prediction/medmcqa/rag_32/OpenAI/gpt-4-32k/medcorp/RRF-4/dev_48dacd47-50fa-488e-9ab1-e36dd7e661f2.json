    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a child with a rotated maxillary central incisor in an otherwise normal occlusion. This suggests that the issue is localized to this tooth and not a result of a more generalized malocclusion or jaw misalignment. The options provided suggest different approaches to managing this issue. Checking for supernumerary teeth (option A) could be relevant if there was a suggestion of impaction or delayed eruption, but this is not mentioned in the question. Resection of supracrestal fibers (option B) is a surgical procedure that might be considered in cases of severe tooth mobility or periodontal disease, which is also not mentioned in the question. Exerting a couple on the tooth (option C) is a term used in orthodontics to describe the application of forces to rotate a tooth back into its correct position. This seems the most relevant to the case described. Fixed orthodontic appliances (option D) could be used to correct a range of malocclusions, but might be considered an over-treatment for a single rotated tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
