    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the potential effects of combining metoprolol and verapamil in a hypertensive patient. Both metoprolol and verapamil are medications used to manage cardiovascular conditions. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, and verapamil is a calcium channel blocker. Both of these medications can slow the heart rate. Document [1] reports a case of Wenckebach type atrioventricular block occurring in a patient on metoprolol and verapamil, suggesting that this combination can lead to bradycardia with AV block. The other options, such as atrial fibrillation, Torsades de pointes, and tachycardia, are not mentioned in the documents as potential outcomes of combining these two medications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
