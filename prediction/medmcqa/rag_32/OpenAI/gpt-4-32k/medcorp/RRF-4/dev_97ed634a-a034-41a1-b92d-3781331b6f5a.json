    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxillary sinus starts developing during the 10th week of intrauterine life and shows a biphasic growth pattern at 3 and 7 to 18 years of age (Document [18]). The ethmoid sinuses are comprised of three to four air cells at birth and by the time an individual reaches adulthood, they consist of 1 to 15 aerated cells (Document [18]). The frontal sinuses are absent at birth, but are generally well developed, and functional between the sixth and eighth years, though they continue to grow slower until reaching their maximum size after puberty (Document [12]). The sphenoid sinus appears at the age of three, and fully develop during adulthood (Document [2]). Therefore, all sinuses grow till early adulthood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Maxillary, B.
