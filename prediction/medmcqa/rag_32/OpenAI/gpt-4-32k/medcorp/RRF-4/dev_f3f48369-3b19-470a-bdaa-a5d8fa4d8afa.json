    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Many of the documents mention the importance of folic acid or folate intake during the preconceptional period in reducing the risk of neural tube defects. For example, Document [0] discusses the role of folic acid in the primary prevention of neural-tube defects. Document [1] also mentions the importance of increasing folate intake before conception to prevent neural tube defects. Document [4] states that the pharmacologic periconceptional intake of folic acid reduces the risk of neural tube defects by approximately 40-75%. Therefore, the answer is folate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
