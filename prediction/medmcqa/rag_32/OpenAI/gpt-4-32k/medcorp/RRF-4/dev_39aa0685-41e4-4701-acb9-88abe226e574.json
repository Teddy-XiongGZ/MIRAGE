    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate of drug absorption in a plasma concentration graph is represented by the time it takes for the drug to reach its maximum concentration in the plasma. This is represented by Tmax. However, the maximum concentration that the drug reaches, Cmax, also plays a role in understanding the rate of absorption. Therefore, both Tmax and Cmax are needed to give the rate of drug absorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
