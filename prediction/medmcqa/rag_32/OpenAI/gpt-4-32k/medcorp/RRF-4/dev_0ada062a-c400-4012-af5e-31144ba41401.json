    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Scammon's growth curve is a well-known concept in human biology and growth research. It represents the growth of various tissues and organs in the human body. According to Scammon, there are four types of tissues based on their growth rates: neural, lymphoid, general, and genital. Neural tissues grow rapidly during the first 6-7 years of life, reaching their maximum size early. Lymphoid tissues grow rapidly until puberty, reaching a size more than twice the adult amount, and then regress. Genital tissues grow slowly until puberty, at which point there is a growth spurt. Therefore, the statement 'Neural tissues-Most of the growth is completed by 6 years' is true, not false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of the above\"}"
