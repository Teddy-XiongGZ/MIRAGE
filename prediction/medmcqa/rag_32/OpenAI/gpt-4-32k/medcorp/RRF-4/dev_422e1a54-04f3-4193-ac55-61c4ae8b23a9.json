    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy. Heme synthesis is the process that produces heme, a component of hemoglobin, which is used by red blood cells to transport oxygen. According to Document [0] and Document [1], the heme biosynthesis starts in mitochondria with the condensation of succinyl Co-A from the citric acid cycle and an amino acid glycine. Therefore, the intermediate of the Krebs cycle used in heme synthesis is succinyl-CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
