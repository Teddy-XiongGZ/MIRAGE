    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking about the symptoms that are NOT associated with right trochlear nerve palsy. Step 2: Review the documents for information about the symptoms of right trochlear nerve palsy. Step 3: From Document [6], we learn that patients with trochlear nerve palsy complain of double vision vertically (vertical diplopia) or the images being tilted or rotated (torsional diplopia). The diplopia is binocular and may worsen or improve in different gazes. In the case of a right superior oblique involvement, the vertical diplopia is maximum when the right eye is directed downwards and inwards. Step 4: From Document [13], we learn that injury to the trochlear nerve cause weakness of downward eye movement with consequent vertical diplopia (double vision). The affected eye drifts upward relative to the normal eye, due to the unopposed actions of the remaining extraocular muscles. The patient sees two visual fields (one from each eye), separated vertically. To compensate for this, patients learn to tilt the head forward (tuck the chin in) in order to bring the fields back together\u2014to fuse the two images into a single visual field. Step 5: From Document [29], we learn that the diplopia presented in trochlear nerve palsy is either vertical or diagonal and is worse with a downward gaze. Compensation for the nerve palsy usually includes a head tilt to the opposing side and tucking in the chin, so the affected eye\u2019s pupil can move up and extort, instead of downwards and intort. During clinical examination, the eyes will display hypertropia with the affected eye being slightly elevated relative to the other normal eye. Under cover, the affected eye will show an upward drift relative to the other eye. Step 6: From the information gathered, we can conclude that right trochlear nerve palsy does not lead to diplopia on upward gaze and adduction (A), as the diplopia is worse with a downward gaze. It does lead to right head tilt (B), as a compensation mechanism. The documents do not mention exotropia (C) or hyperopia (D) as symptoms of right trochlear nerve palsy. Based on the above, the answer is A. Diplopia on upward gaze and adduction. This symptom is not associated with right trochlear nerve palsy. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the symptoms that are NOT associated with right trochlear nerve palsy.
