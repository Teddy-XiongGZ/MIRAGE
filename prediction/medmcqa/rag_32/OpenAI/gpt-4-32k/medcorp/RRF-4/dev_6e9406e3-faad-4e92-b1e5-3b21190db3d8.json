    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The station of the fetus is defined relative to its position in the maternal pelvis. When the bony fetal presenting part is aligned with the maternal ischial spine, the fetus is 0 station. Proximal to the ischial spines are stations -1 centimeter to -5 centimeters, and distal to the ischial spines is +1 to +5 station. Therefore, a +1 station implies that the fetal head is 1 cm below the ischial spine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
