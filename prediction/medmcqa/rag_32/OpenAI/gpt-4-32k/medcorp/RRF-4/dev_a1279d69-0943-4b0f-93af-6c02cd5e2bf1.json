    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The buccinator muscle is pierced by several structures. According to Document [0], the parotid duct (Stenson's duct) and the buccal branch of the mandibular nerve pierce the buccinator muscle. Document [13] also confirms that the parotid duct pierces the buccinator muscle. Document [27] also confirms that the parotid duct pierces the buccinator muscle.

Therefore, the labial branch of the facial nerve is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
