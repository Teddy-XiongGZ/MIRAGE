    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystocele, enterocele, and urethral descent are conditions related to the weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. The pubococcygeus muscle is a part of the levator ani group of muscles, which forms the majority of the pelvic floor. An injury to this muscle could potentially lead to the mentioned conditions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles are part of the superficial perineal pouch and are more involved in sexual function rather than supporting pelvic organs. The sphincter of urethra and anus are involved in controlling the release of urine and feces, respectively, and their injury might lead to incontinence but not necessarily to organ descent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
