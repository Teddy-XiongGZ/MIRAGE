    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has right side hearing loss, which is better heard in a noisy environment. This suggests a conductive hearing loss, as sensorineural hearing loss typically worsens in noisy environments. The audiogram shows a 30-40 dB gap between air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) in the right ear, which is indicative of conductive hearing loss. Rinne's test is negative, which means bone conduction is better than air conduction, again suggesting conductive hearing loss. Weber's test is centralised, which is normal and does not help in localizing the side of hearing loss. Among the given options, stapedial otosclerosis is a condition that leads to conductive hearing loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
