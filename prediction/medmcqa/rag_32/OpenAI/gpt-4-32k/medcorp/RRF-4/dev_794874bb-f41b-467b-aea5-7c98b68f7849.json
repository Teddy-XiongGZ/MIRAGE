    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a complex structure that involves various tissues, including bone, muscle, and ligaments. According to Document [0], sensory signals from the TMJ are relayed along nerve fibers that form the trigeminal nerve. Document [7] states that the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular portion (V3) of the trigeminal nerve, innervates the lateral capsule of the TMJ. Document [17] also confirms that the lateral area of the capsule is innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve. Therefore, the auriculotemporal nerve is the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of the TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
