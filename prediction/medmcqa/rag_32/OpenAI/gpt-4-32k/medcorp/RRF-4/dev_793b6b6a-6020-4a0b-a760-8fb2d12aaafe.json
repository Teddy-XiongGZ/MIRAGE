    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Supragingival plaque is the plaque that forms above the gums. Over time, the composition of this plaque changes. Initially, it is composed mostly of aerobic bacteria, which need oxygen to survive. However, if the plaque remains on the tooth for a longer period of time, anaerobic bacteria begin to grow in this plaque. These bacteria can only survive if there is no oxygen. This information suggests that over time, the plaque microflora becomes more anaerobic, which is often associated with gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the answer should be that the plaque microflora becomes gram negative over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
