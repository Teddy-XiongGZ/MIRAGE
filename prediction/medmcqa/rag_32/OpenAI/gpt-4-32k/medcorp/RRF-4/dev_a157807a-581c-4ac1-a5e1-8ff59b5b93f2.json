    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Centric interference refers to the premature contact between teeth when the jaw is in centric occlusion. This can lead to various dental problems such as temporomandibular joint dysfunction. To remove this interference, it would be necessary to adjust the areas of the teeth that are making premature contact. The supporting cusps and the central fossa are both areas of the teeth that could potentially be causing this interference. Therefore, adjusting either or both of these areas could potentially remove the interference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Both of the above\"}"
