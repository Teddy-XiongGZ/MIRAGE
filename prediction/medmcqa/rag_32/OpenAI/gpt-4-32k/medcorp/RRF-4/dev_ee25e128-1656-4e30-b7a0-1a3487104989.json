    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The firing process in ceramics involves several stages, including the bisque stages and the fusion stage. The bisque stages refer to the initial firing processes to remove physical water and chemical water from the clay. The fusion stage is the final stage where the ceramic particles fuse together to form the completed restoration. According to the documents, significant shrinkage occurs during the fusion stage where the ceramic particles fuse together to form the completed restoration (Document 2). This is also supported by Document 1, which mentions that significant changes, including shrinkage, occur during the firing process. Therefore, the maximum shrinkage during the firing process in ceramics occurs in the fusion stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
