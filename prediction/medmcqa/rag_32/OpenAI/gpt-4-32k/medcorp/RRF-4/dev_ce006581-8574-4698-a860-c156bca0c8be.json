    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the 95% confidence interval for an estimated prevalence of 10% with a sample size of 100. From Document [0], we know that for a 10% error bound (B), we need a sample size (n) of 100. This aligns with the given sample size in the question. However, the document does not provide information on how to calculate the confidence interval. Document [1] provides an example where a 10% result from a sample of 3000 women would provide a 95% CI of 9%-11%. However, the sample size in the question is significantly smaller (100), so this example does not directly apply. Document [3] provides a formula for calculating the sample size needed for a certain confidence interval width, but it does not provide a formula for calculating the confidence interval given a certain sample size and estimated prevalence. Therefore, the given documents do not provide enough information to calculate the 95% confidence interval for an estimated prevalence of 10% with a sample size of 100.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
