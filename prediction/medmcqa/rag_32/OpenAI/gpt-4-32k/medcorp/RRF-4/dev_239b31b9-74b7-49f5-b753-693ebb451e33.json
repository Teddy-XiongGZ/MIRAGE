    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the direction of the proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar. The proximal walls of a class II cavity are the sides of the cavity that are adjacent to the neighboring teeth. In a class II cavity, these walls would be prepared in such a way that they provide adequate support and retention for the filling material. The documents do not provide specific information about the direction of the proximal walls in a class II cavity on a deciduous molar. However, based on general dental knowledge, the proximal walls of a class II cavity should not undermine the enamel, which is very thin in deciduous teeth. Therefore, the answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
