    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the relationship between the angle between adhesive and adherent and the wetting of surfaces. According to Document [3], a contact angle closer to zero indicates a more wettable interaction. Document [11] also states that the ideal contact angle is 0\u00b0, meaning the adhesive perfectly wets the membrane and good contact is achieved. Document [22] also confirms that a low contact angle indicates a high degree of wetting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
