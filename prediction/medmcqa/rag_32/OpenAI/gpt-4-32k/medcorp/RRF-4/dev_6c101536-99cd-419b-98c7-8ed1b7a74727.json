    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the statistical test used to determine the significance of difference in height of children between two classes in a school. From the documents, it is mentioned that the Student-t test and the nested analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the variation of height and BMI within classes. However, the Student-t test is used for one sample to check the difference in comparison to a population with a standard deviation equal to 1. On the other hand, ANOVA is used where height and BMI were dependent variables, and classes were nested into schools. Therefore, when comparing the height of children between two classes, ANOVA would be the appropriate test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
