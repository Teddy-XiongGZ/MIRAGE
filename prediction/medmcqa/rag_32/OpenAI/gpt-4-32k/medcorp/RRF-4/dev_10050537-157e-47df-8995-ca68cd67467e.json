From Document [2], I learned that Glycopyrrolate does not cross the blood-brain barrier or the placenta. Document [22] mentions that Scopolamine, also known as Hyoscine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, so it can be eliminated. I couldn't find specific information about Hyoscine butylbromide or Atropine in the provided documents. However, since I found that Glycopyrrolate does meet the criteria of not crossing the blood-brain barrier or the placenta, I can confidently choose this as the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
