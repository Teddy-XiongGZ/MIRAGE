    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the major fimbrial structural component of P. gingivalis. Fimbriae are hair-like appendages that bacteria use for adhesion. Looking at the documents, Document [9] mentions that FimA, also known as major fimbriae, are long, peritrichous, filamentous components that mediate invasion and colonization of host cells contributing to P. gingivalis virulence. This suggests that FimA is the major fimbrial structural component of P. gingivalis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
