    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gluconeogenesis is the process of synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. According to the documents, the enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis include pyruvate carboxylase, PEP carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase. However, pyruvate kinase is not mentioned as an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis. Instead, it is mentioned as an enzyme involved in glycolysis, which is the process of breaking down glucose. Therefore, pyruvate kinase is not involved in gluconeogenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pyruvate kinase\"}"
