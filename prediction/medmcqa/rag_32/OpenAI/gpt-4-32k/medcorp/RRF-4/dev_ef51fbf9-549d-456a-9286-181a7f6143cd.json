    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking which condition does not decrease the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. Step 2: Review the documents for information on the conditions listed in the answer choices and their effect on the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. Step 3: Document [3] states that DLCO is decreased in any condition which affects the effective alveolar surface area, including interstitial lung disease and emphysema. This eliminates choices B and C. Step 4: Document [28] mentions that factors that can increase the DLCO include polycythemia. This suggests that polycythemia does not decrease the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide, making it a potential answer. Step 5: Document [24] suggests that DLNO/DLCO ratio is significantly higher in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension than in healthy subjects, which implies that pulmonary vascular disease can decrease the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. This eliminates choice D. Step 6: Based on the information from the documents, the condition that does not decrease the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide is polycythemia. Final Answer: A.
