    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myocardial infarction is primarily caused by the occlusion of a coronary artery, which leads to a lack of oxygen supply to the heart muscle. This results in ischemia and eventually necrosis of the heart muscle, as stated in documents [7], [8], [12], [15], [16], [18], [20], and [27]. Therefore, the major pathology in myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis caused by acute occlusion of a coronary artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
