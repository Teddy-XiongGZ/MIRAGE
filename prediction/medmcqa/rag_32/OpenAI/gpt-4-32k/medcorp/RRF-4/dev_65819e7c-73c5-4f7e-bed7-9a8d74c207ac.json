    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the removal of a Foley's catheter when the balloon cannot be deflated. Document [6] provides information on this issue. It mentions that the balloon should never be inflated until rupture to prevent leaving loose fragments. It also suggests that a ureteric catheter or its stylet can be used to deflate the balloon. The balloon can also be ruptured with a fine needle under ultrasound guidance, but it should not have been inflated to more than 50% of its volume to prevent leaving loose fragments in the bladder. Therefore, the answer should be the option that involves using ultrasound guidance to locate and prick the balloon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
