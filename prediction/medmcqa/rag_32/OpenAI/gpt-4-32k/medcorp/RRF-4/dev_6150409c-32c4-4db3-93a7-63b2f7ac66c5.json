    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. It is due to the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines from mast cells and basophils, typically due to an immunologic reaction. The preformed mediators from mast cells include histamine, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, and proteoglycans (heparin, chondroitin sulfates). Newly synthesized mediators include prostaglandin D\u2082, leukotriene D\u2084, and platelet activating factor. Therefore, the answer should be all of these.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
