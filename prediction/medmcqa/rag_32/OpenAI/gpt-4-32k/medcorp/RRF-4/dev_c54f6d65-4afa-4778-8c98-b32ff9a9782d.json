    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with episodic tachycardia, occasional extra-systole, and amblyopia. Tachycardia is a condition where the heart rate exceeds the normal resting rate, often due to stress, exercise, or underlying health issues as mentioned in Document [30]. Extra-systole refers to an extra heartbeat, which is often harmless but can sometimes indicate heart disease. Amblyopia, as described in Document [12], is a common eye ailment in children, often referred to as 'lazy eye', but it's not clear how it's related to the patient's heart symptoms. None of the documents provided directly link these symptoms to the substances listed in the answer choices. However, it's known that certain substances can affect heart rate. Nicotine (Choice A) is a stimulant that can increase heart rate. Cannabis (Choice B) can also increase heart rate, but it's more associated with a relaxed state rather than episodes of rapid heart rate. Atropine (Choice C) is a medication used to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings, some types of slow heart rate, and to decrease saliva production during surgery, it's not typically associated with causing tachycardia. Cocaine (Choice D) is a powerful stimulant that significantly increases heart rate and can cause erratic heart rhythms. Given the information provided, cocaine seems to be the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
