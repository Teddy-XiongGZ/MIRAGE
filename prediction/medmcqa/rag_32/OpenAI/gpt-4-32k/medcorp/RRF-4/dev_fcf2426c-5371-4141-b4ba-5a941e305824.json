    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the conditions in which relative bradycardia is uncommon. Relative bradycardia is a condition where the heart rate is slower than would be expected given the individual's current condition. None of the documents provided information about relative bradycardia in relation to Brucellosis, Typhoid, Malaria, or Factitious fever. However, Document [5] mentions that relative bradycardia is seen in typhoid fever. Therefore, relative bradycardia is not uncommon in typhoid. The answer should be among the other three options. Since the documents do not provide information about relative bradycardia in relation to Brucellosis, Malaria, or Factitious fever, I cannot definitively choose between these three options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot determine from the documents provided\"}"
