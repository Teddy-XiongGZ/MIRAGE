    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypernatremia is a condition characterized by high levels of sodium in the blood. The documents provided suggest that hypernatremia in breast-fed infants is often due to insufficient lactation or elevated sodium levels in breast milk, leading to dehydration. Diabetes insipidus is a condition characterized by excessive thirst and excretion of large amounts of severely diluted urine, which could lead to dehydration, but the urine sodium levels are usually low, not high. Acute necrosis is a type of cell death, which doesn't directly relate to sodium levels. Excessive intake of sodium could lead to hypernatremia, but it's unlikely in a breast-fed infant. Therefore, the most likely cause of hypernatremia in a breast-fed infant is severe dehydration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
