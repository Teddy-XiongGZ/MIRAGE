    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. The risk of endocarditis is higher in conditions that cause turbulent blood flow or damage to the heart valves. According to Document [18], altered blood flow is more likely in high pressure areas, so ventricular septal defects (VSD) or patent ductus arteriosus can create more susceptibility than atrial septal defects (ASD). Mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) are conditions that can cause turbulent blood flow and damage to the heart valves, increasing the risk of endocarditis. Therefore, the risk of endocarditis is less in atrial septal defects (ASD) compared to the other options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. ASD\"}"
