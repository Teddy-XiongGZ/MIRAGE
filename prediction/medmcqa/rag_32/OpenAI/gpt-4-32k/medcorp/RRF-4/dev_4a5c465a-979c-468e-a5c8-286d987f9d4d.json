    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which hormone acts by crossing the cell membrane. From the documents, it is clear that steroid hormones and lipid-soluble hormones can cross the cell membrane. Thyroxine is a thyroid hormone and it is lipid-soluble, so it can cross the cell membrane. On the other hand, insulin, glucagon, and calcitonin are peptide hormones, which are water-soluble and act on the surface of target cells, not by crossing the cell membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Thyroxine\"}"
