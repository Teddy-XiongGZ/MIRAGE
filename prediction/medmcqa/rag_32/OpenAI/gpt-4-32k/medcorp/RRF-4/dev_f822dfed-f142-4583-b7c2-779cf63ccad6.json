    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fish tail deformity is a term that has been mentioned in multiple documents. Document [0] mentions fish tail deformity after fractures of the lateral humeral condyle in children. Document [3] also talks about fishtail deformity of distal humerus in a 13-year-old boy. Document [6] refers to fishtail deformity as a rare complication of distal humeral fractures in children. Document [7] also mentions fishtail deformity as an uncommon complication of distal humeral fractures in children. Document [9] describes fishtail deformity of the elbow, which develops when the lateral trochlear ossification centres fails to develop or resorbs, usually following a distal humeral fracture in childhood. Document [11] talks about fishtail deformity as a very rare complication of undisplaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children. Document [12] suggests vascular compromise as a possible explanation for 'fish-tail' deformities seen as sequellae of different fracture patterns. Document [22] also mentions fishtail deformity after displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children. Document [25] talks about fishtail deformity of the distal humerus. Document [30] refers to fishtail deformity as a complication of pediatric elbow fractures. All these documents point towards the distal humerus as the site of injury leading to fish tail deformity in children.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Distal humerus\"}"
