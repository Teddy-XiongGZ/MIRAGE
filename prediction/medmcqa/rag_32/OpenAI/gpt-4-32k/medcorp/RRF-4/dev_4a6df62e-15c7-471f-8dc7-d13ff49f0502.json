    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of material that provides pulpal medication and thermal protection. Document [1] mentions the use of a protective base or liner with materials that are known to be irritating to the pulp. Document [21] also mentions the use of a sedative dressing, such as calcium hydroxide or MTA, to protect the pulp from noxious agents like heat, cold, and bacteria. These materials stimulate the cell-rich zone of the pulp to lay down a bridge of reparative dentin. Therefore, the answer should be the one that refers to a protective base or liner.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Cement bases\"}"
