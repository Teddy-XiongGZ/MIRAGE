    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulpal injury progression leads to inflammation and increased pressure within the pulp chamber. This is due to the enclosed nature of the pulp chamber which does not allow the increased pressure to be displaced to other tissues, resulting in pressure on the nerve of the tooth and adjacent tissues. This pressure on the nerve fibers is what causes the pain. Therefore, the main cause of pain during pulpal injury progression is not increased vascular permeability (choice A), decreased threshold of nerve fibres to pain (choice B), or arteriolar dilatation (choice C). Instead, it is the increased pressure within the pulp chamber.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
