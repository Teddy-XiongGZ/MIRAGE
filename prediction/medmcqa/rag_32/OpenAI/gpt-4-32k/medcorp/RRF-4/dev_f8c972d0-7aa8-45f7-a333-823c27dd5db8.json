    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) is a measure of the difference between the alveolar concentration (A) of oxygen and the arterial (a) concentration of oxygen. It is an useful parameter for narrowing the differential diagnosis of hypoxemia. In states of ventilation perfusion mismatch, such as pulmonary embolism or right-to-left shunt, oxygen is not effectively transferred from the alveoli to the blood which results in an elevated A-a gradient. Therefore, the maximum alveolar arterial oxygen difference is seen in conditions where there is a ventilation perfusion mismatch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Pulmonary embolism\"}"
