    "First, let's identify where each of these cells is located in the layers of the epidermis: 1. Corneocytes: These are terminally differentiated keratinocytes that make up most of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis (Document [29]). 2. Merkel cells: These are found in the stratum basale, the deepest layer of the epidermis (Document [21]). 3. Melanocytes: These are also found in the stratum basale (Document [19]). 4. Langerhans cells: These are located in the stratum spinosum, which is above the stratum basale but below the stratum corneum (Document [30]). So, from surface to deep layer, the arrangement would be: Corneocytes > Langerhans cells > Melanocytes > Merkel cells. Therefore, the answer is D. corneocytes > langerhans cells > melanocytes > merkel cells.
