Looking at the documents, there are several scores mentioned that are related to wound infection, such as the TILI score, W.A.R. score, ASEPSIS score, and the Wound Score. However, none of these match the options given in the question. The Glasgow coma scale is used for assessing the level of consciousness in a person following a traumatic brain injury. The Southampton score is used for assessing the risk of complications in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The Apgar score is used to assess the physical condition of a newborn immediately after birth. The SIRS score is used to identify systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Therefore, none of the options given in the question are used for wound infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
