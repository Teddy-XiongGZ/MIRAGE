    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the term for the segmentation of blood in blood vessels after death. Looking through the documents, Document [20] mentions 'trucking' or segmentation of retinal blood vessels as one of the first observable signs after death. However, it does not provide a specific term for this phenomenon. Document [7] also mentions the break-up of the columns of blood in the retinal blood vessels (retinal vascular segmentation) on ophthalmoscopy as one of the earliest indications of death. However, it does not provide a specific term either. None of the documents mention the terms provided in the answer choices. Therefore, I will need to use external knowledge to answer this question. From my medical knowledge, I know that the term for the segmentation of blood in blood vessels after death is known as the 'Rokitansky sign'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Rokitansky sign\"}"
