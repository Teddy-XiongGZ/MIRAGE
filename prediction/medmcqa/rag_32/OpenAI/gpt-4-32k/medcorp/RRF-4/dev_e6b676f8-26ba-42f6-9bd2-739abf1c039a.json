    "Based on the provided documents, we can gather the following information: - Document [1] mentions that electrical couplings were found between odontoblasts, suggesting the presence of gap junctions. - Document [23] also confirms the presence of gap junctions between odontoblasts. - Document [29] describes the presence of tight junctions (also known as zonula occludens) between odontoblasts. - However, none of the documents mention the presence of zona adherens in the odontoblastic layer. Therefore, the answer should be B. Gap junctions and C. Zonula occludens. Here is the output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention the presence of gap junctions and zonula occludens (tight junctions) in the odontoblastic layer. However, there is no mention of zona adherens in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Gap junctions, C. Zonula occludens\"}"
