    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the method to regain arch length in the anterior segment by moving incisors labially. Document [0] discusses the procedures which may be useful in the correction of discrepancies in anterior interocclusal arch length, which includes repositioning of upright maxillary incisors to increase upper dental arch length. Document [4] talks about the use of three-pieces segment arch to intrude incisors and control the extrusion of posterior teeth. Document [10] mentions the use of pendulum and lingual arch appliances simultaneously in the upper and in the lower arch respectively to gain space. Document [19] discusses the use of lingual arch to maintain arch length. Document [23] talks about the use of Nance lingual arch for preserving leeway space, thus contributing for correction of lower anterior crowding. However, none of the documents specifically mention the use of cephalometric analysis, tongue blade therapy, 7 spring with Hawley's retainer, or anterior bite plane for regaining arch length by moving incisors labially.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
