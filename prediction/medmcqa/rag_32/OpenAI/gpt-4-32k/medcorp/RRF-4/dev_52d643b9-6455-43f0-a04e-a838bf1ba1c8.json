    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pure left-sided heart failure is characterized by the failure of the left side of the heart to pump blood effectively to the systemic circulation. This can be caused by conditions that put a strain on the left side of the heart. Atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) are conditions that cause a left-to-right shunt, leading to volume overload on the right side of the heart, not the left. Therefore, they are not likely to cause pure left-sided heart failure. On the other hand, aortic stenosis is a condition that obstructs the outflow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta, causing the left ventricle to work harder to pump blood, which can lead to left-sided heart failure. Pulmonary valvular obstruction affects the right side of the heart, not the left, so it would not cause pure left-sided heart failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
