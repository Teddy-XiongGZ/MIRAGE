    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a common constituent in occlusal sealants, bonding agents, and composite resins. Document [12] mentions that BIS-GMA is used as the basis for many resin-based sealant/composite material developments in dentistry. Document [30] also mentions that developments in the mechanical and physical properties of the resins, fillers, coupling agents and bonding agents within these materials have led to wider applications for the composite in dentistry. Therefore, BIS-GMA is a common constituent in occlusal sealants, bonding agents, and composite resins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
