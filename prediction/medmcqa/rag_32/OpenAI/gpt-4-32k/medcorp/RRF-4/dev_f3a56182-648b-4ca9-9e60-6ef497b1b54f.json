    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of sensitivity in the gingival area of class II light cured composite restoration after 2 months. Document [1] mentions that less postoperative sensitivity was observed at postoperative 24 hours assessment in restoration placed using SE adhesives compared to TE adhesives. Document [2] mentions that the step mode of the LED curing light reduced the incidence and severity of postoperative sensitivity following placement of posterior composite restorations compared to the fast mode of the same curing light. Document [15] mentions that after 2 years, 5 out of 148 restorations had failed, giving a failure rate of 5% of the tested materials. Five restorations failed due to hypersensitivity. Document [16] mentions that light-cured resin composites are a viable option for restoring Class I and Class II cavities; however, several researchers have reported postoperative sensitivity in such restorations. In this in vivo study, 80 teeth with Class I and Class II cavities were selected. They were divided into four groups of 20 teeth each, to be restored with composite resin using different treatment protocols. Postoperative sensitivity to cold water at various temperatures was assessed for up to three months. The data was interpreted using Chi Square Test for homogeneity among the groups, and Z values of significance for pair-wise evaluation were determined. It was found that use of self-etching primers as bonding agents underneath the composite resin restorations were associated with significantly decreased incidence of postoperative sensitivity to cold stimuli. Based on these documents, it seems that the curing method and the type of adhesive used can affect the postoperative sensitivity. Therefore, the answer is likely related to the curing method.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Curing from occlusal area only\"}"
