    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From Document [0], we know that enzymes increase the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. This means that a decrease in activation energy leads to an increase in enzyme activity. Document [1] mentions that increases in temperature generally lead to increases in reaction rates, but there is a limit to the increase because higher temperatures lead to a sharp decrease in reaction rates due to the denaturation of the enzyme. Therefore, an increase in temperature can increase enzyme activity, but only up to a certain point. Extremes of pH value and low substrate concentration are generally not favorable for enzyme activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decrease in activation energy\"}"
