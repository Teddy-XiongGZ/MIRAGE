    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At physiological pH, amino acids can have a positive, negative, or neutral charge depending on their side chains. Valine and Isoleucine are nonpolar and thus have a neutral charge. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain and thus carries a negative charge. Arginine, on the other hand, has a basic side chain and thus carries a positive charge at physiological pH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Arginine\"}"
