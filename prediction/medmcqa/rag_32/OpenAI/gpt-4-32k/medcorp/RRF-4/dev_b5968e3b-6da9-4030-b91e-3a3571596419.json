    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spherocytes are red blood cells that are sphere-shaped rather than bi-concave disk shaped as normal. They are found in all hemolytic anemias to some degree. However, hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are characterized by having only spherocytes. In autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the red blood cells become spherocytes due to the loss of membrane caused by the action of antibodies. In hereditary spherocytosis, the red blood cells are inherently spherocytes due to a genetic defect. However, the documents suggest that the changes are more pronounced in hereditary spherocytosis compared to autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Therefore, maximum spherocytes are likely seen in hereditary spherocytosis. However, this option is not provided in the choices. Therefore, the answer should be 'None'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
