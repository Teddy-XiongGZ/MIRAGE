    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a surgeon with less experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy who finds a stone in the common bile duct during surgery. According to Document [0], the surgeon has several choices. However, the document also mentions that laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is useful in situations when laparoscopic common bile duct exploration equipment or surgeon expertise is not available. Given the surgeon's lack of experience, it would be risky to attempt a laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct. Open cholecystectomy with choledochoduodenostomy, as suggested in option A, is not the best choice because it is a more invasive procedure. Open CBD exploration, as suggested in option D, is also more invasive. Therefore, the best choice would be to place a double lumen catheter through the cystic duct with a proximal lumen in the common bile duct and the distal lumen in the duodenum, as described in Document [0]. This can be used for serial postoperative cholangiography to confirm spontaneous stone passage or falsely positive operative cholangiograms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
