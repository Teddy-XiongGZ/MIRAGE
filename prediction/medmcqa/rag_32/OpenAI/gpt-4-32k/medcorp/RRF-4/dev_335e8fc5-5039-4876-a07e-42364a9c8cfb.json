    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen synthesis and breakdown indeed occur in the same cell, but they are tightly regulated processes that do not occur simultaneously. However, the question is specifically about why glucose-6-phosphate, which is produced during glycogenesis, is not immediately degraded by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. According to Document [21], glucose-6-phosphatase is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell, not in the cytoplasm where glycogenesis occurs. Therefore, glucose-6-phosphatase cannot immediately act on the glucose-6-phosphate produced in the cytoplasm during glycogenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
