    "The first step is to understand the question, which is asking for the unpaired bone in the facial skeleton. This means we are looking for a bone that is singular and not duplicated on the other side of the face. Next, we need to review the documents to find information about the facial skeleton and the specific bones listed in the answer choices. Document [0] lists the bones in the facial skeleton, including the vomer, but does not specify which are paired or unpaired. Document [1] also lists the bones in the facial skeleton, including the vomer, and specifies that the vomer is singular (1), implying that it is unpaired. Document [2] confirms that the vomer is unpaired. The other documents do not provide additional relevant information. Based on this information, the unpaired bone in the facial skeleton is the vomer. The final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I understood the question to be asking for the unpaired bone in the facial skelet"
