    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best method to handle a child's dental difficulties that are traced back to his mother. Looking at the options, introducing another child as a good example (Option A) might not be effective as it doesn't directly address the child's fear or anxiety. Using small amounts of barbiturates (Option C) is not a good option as it involves medicating the child which should be a last resort and not a primary method of handling the situation. Using firmness (Option D) might not be effective and could potentially increase the child's fear or anxiety. This leaves us with Option B - Modify his fear by familiarization. This method involves gradually exposing the child to the dental situation to reduce fear and anxiety, which aligns with the information from the documents that systematic stepwise learning and the 'tell-show-do' method can be effective in managing dental behaviour problems.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
