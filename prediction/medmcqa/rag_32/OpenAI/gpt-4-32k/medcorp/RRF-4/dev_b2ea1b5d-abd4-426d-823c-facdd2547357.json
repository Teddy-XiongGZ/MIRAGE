    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of hardening a metal by plastic deformation is known as work hardening or strain hardening. This process involves the dislocation movements and generation within the crystal structure of a material. When a stainless steel orthodontic wire is bent at room temperature, it undergoes plastic deformation, which results in an increase in its hardness and strength. This is a typical example of work or strain hardening.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Work/ Strain hardening\"}"
