    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pituitary gland is responsible for the production of several hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine (T4), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which regulate the menstrual cycle in women, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoids. However, the pituitary gland does not produce mineralocorticoids, which are produced by the adrenal cortex. Therefore, if a patient undergoes a hypophysectomy, they would not need replacement of mineralocorticoids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Mineralocoicoids\"}"
