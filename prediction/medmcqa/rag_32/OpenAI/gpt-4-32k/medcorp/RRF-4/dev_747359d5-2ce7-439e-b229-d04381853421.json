    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand the normal values for pH and pCO2. According to Document [6], the normal values for pH are 7.35 to 7.45 and for pCO2 are 35 to 45 mmHg. The patient's pH is 7.3, which is below the normal range, indicating acidosis. The pCO2 is 35 mmHg, which is within the normal range. This means that the acidosis is not due to a respiratory issue, as respiratory acidosis would be indicated by a high pCO2. Therefore, the acidosis must be metabolic in nature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metabolic acidosis\"}"
