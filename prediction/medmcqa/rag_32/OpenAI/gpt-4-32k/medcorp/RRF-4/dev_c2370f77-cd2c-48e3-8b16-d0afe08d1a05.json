    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inter-arch distance measured when the occlusal rims are in uniform contact refers to the distance between the upper and lower jaws when the teeth are in maximum contact. This is known as the Vertical Dimension of Occlusion (VDO). The VDO is the distance between two anatomical or marked points (usually one on the tip of the nose and one on the chin) when the occluding members are in contact. Freeway space refers to the space between the upper and lower teeth when the mandible is in its physiological rest position. Vertical dimension of rest is the distance measured when the mandible is in the physiological rest position. Christensen's space is the space between the upper and lower posterior teeth during protrusive movements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
