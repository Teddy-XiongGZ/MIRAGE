    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Interstitial fluid volume is part of the extracellular fluid volume. According to Document [25], extracellular fluid volume can be measured using labeled inulin, sucrose, mannitol, or sulfate. These are large molecules and are therefore impermeable to the cell membrane and will only be able to diffuse to the plasma and interstitial spaces. However, none of the options provided in the question include these substances. Therefore, I need to look for other methods mentioned in the documents. Document [4] mentions that interstitial fluid volume can be calculated by subtracting plasma volume from extracellular fluid volume. However, this doesn't help in choosing the correct answer either. None of the documents provided mention the use of radioactive iodine, water, sodium, or albumin specifically for measuring interstitial fluid volume. Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not possible to definitively choose the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
