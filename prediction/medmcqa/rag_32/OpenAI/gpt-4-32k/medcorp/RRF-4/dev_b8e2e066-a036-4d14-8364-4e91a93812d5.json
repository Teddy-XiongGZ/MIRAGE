    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In diabetes mellitus, the body's ability to regulate insulin is impaired. This leads to an imbalance in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. According to Document [1], the most common abnormality associated with hypertriglyceridemia in human diabetes appears to be overproduction of VLDL triglycerides. Document [20] also mentions that overproduction of VLDL leads to increased plasma levels of triglycerides. This overproduction is due to increased rates of synthesis of VLDL. Document [27] also mentions that in patients with insulin resistance or type II diabetes, overproduction of VLDL occurs partly due to the resistance to insulin and also because of lower lipoprotein lipase activity. Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in VLDL. Therefore, a decrease in its activity would lead to an increase in VLDL and triglyceride levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
