    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several markers for neural tube defects, including acetylcholinesterase and alpha-fetoprotein. However, the documents suggest that alpha-fetoprotein is the primary screening tool for neural tube defects due to its increased safety, sensitivity, and decreased false positive rate compared to other markers. Therefore, alpha-fetoprotein is likely the best marker for neural tube defects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Alpha fetoprotein\"}"
