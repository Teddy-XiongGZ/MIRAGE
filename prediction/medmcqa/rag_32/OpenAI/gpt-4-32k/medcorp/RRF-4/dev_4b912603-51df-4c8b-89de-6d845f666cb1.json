Therefore, option 'b' is correct. However, it is not true that hyperglycemia occurs in all infants of diabetic mothers. While it is a risk, it does not occur in all cases (Document 0, Document 1, Document 14, Document 20, Document 24, Document 28). Therefore, option 'a' is not correct. Infants of diabetic mothers are more likely to be large for gestational age or macrosomic, not small (Document 0, Document 1, Document 4, Document 10, Document 14, Document 20, Document 24, Document 28). Therefore, option 'c' is not correct. There is no information in the documents to suggest that beta agonist drugs are contraindicated during delivery for diabetic mothers. Therefore, option 'd' is not correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
