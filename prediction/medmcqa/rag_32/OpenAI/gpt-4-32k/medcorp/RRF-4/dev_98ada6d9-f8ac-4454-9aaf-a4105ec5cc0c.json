    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [0] provides information about the loads across the fracture depending on the position of the fracture and the bite point. It mentions that positive bending moments were defined to give compression at the border, negative bending moments to give compression at the alveolar side of the mandible. The angle and posterior body fracture have high positive bending moments, small torsion moments and high shear forces. This means that when the load is applied posterior to the site of fracture, it results in compression at the border of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Compression on upper border\"}"
