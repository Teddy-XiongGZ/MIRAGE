    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. It is used to understand how much the values deviate from the mean or average. When we talk about the standard deviation of means, it is related to the dispersion of sample means around the population mean. This is essentially a measure of the variability or dispersion of the means of different samples drawn from the same population, which is a concept related to sampling error. Sampling error refers to the difference between a population parameter and a sample statistic used to estimate it. Therefore, standard deviation of means measures sampling error.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
