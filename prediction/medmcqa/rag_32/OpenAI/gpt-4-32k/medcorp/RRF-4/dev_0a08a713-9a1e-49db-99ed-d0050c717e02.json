    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tooth that has a greater crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane. This means we are looking for a tooth that has a larger part of its crown on the side away from the midline of the mouth (distal) and in the direction from the tongue to the cheek (faciolingual). From the documents, it is mentioned that the mandibular second premolar has a well-developed lingual cusp which is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual. This suggests that the mandibular second premolar has a greater crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Second premolar\"}"
