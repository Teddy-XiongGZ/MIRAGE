    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about the changes in salivary gland output in Sjogren's syndrome. Document [4] mentions that the absolute concentrations of albumin, cystatin C, cystatin S, total IgA and total protein are increased significantly in Sjogren's syndrome, which contradicts option D. Document [0] states that patients with Sjogren's syndrome have a decreased salivary gland function, which supports option C. However, I couldn't find any specific information about the changes in sodium and phosphate concentration in the salivary gland output in Sjogren's syndrome. Therefore, I need to make an educated guess based on the available information. Since Sjogren's syndrome is characterized by a decrease in salivary gland function, it is unlikely that the concentration of any component of saliva, including sodium and phosphate, would increase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
