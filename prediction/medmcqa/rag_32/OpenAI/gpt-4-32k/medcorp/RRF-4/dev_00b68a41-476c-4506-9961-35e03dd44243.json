    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogenesis is the process of glycogen synthesis, while glycogenolysis is the process of glycogen breakdown. From the documents, it is clear that glycogen synthase is involved in the synthesis of glycogen (glycogenesis) and glycogen phosphorylase is involved in the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis). Glucan transferase is involved in the branching of glycogen during its synthesis, and phosphoglucomutase is involved in the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate during glycogenolysis. Therefore, none of the enzymes are common between glycogenesis and glycogenolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
