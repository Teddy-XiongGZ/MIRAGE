    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pellicle formation is a process that involves the deposition of certain substances on a surface. According to Document [0], in the context of dental health, pellicle refers to a thin layer of salivary glycoproteins deposited on the teeth. Document [1] also mentions that pellicle formation involves the formation of a biofilm at the air-liquid interface. Document [2] further explains that the pellicle is formed as a result of the selective adsorption of salivary proteins. Document [3] and Document [5] also confirm that the pellicle is formed by the adsorption of salivary glycoproteins. Therefore, the answer is not related to mineralisation, necrosis, or bacterial colonization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
