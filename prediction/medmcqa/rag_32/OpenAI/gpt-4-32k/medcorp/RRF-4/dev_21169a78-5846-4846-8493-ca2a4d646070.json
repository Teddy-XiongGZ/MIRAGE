    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coefficient of friction is a measure of the amount of friction existing between two surfaces. A higher coefficient indicates a higher degree of friction. To answer this question, I need to find information in the documents that directly compares the coefficients of friction of the given alloys. Document 15 compares the frictional resistance of different alloys including TMA and SS. It states that TMA and ion-implanted TMA have no significant advantage over stainless steel (SS) in terms of frictional resistance. Document 19 compares the frictional characteristics of different alloys including Ni-Ti. It states that Ni-Ti has a lower frictional resistance compared to SS. Document 21 does not provide a direct comparison but it mentions that the friction between archwire of different alloys and brackets ligated with different brands of low friction elastic ligatures was studied. However, it does not provide specific information about the alloys in the question. Elgiloy is not mentioned in any of the documents. Based on the information available, SS seems to have a higher coefficient of friction compared to TMA and Ni-Ti.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
