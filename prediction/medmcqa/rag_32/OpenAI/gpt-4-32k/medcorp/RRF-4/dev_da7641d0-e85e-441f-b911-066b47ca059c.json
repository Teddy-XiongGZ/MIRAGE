    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an empty cavity in the mandible with no lining. From the documents, it is clear that a simple bone cyst or traumatic bone cyst is described as an empty cavity in the mandible with no epithelial lining (Document 1, Document 5, Document 6, Document 17, Document 20, Document 24). However, this option is not available in the choices. The idiopathic bone cavity, also known as Stafne's static cavity, is described as a well-demarcated, asymptomatic, unilateral radiolucent defect in the mandible, indicating lingual invagination of the cortical bone (Document 29). This seems to be the closest match to the description in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Idiopathic bone cavity\"}"
