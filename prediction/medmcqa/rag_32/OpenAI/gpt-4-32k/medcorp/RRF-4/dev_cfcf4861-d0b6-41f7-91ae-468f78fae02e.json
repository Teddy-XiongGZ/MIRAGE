    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has a burn injury caused by hot water on both hands and palms. The description of the lesion being pink, oozing, and painful suggests a second-degree burn. According to Document [14], second-degree burns in children are usually managed with topical therapy alone. Document [11] also supports this, stating that most pediatric burns are partial thickness and are safely managed with topical therapy alone. Therefore, the best management for this patient would likely involve a topical treatment rather than more invasive procedures like excision and grafting. Looking at the options, paraffin gauze and dressing, collagen dressing, and 1% silver sulfasalazine ointment are all topical treatments. However, Document [11] specifically mentions the use of silver sulfadiazine for the treatment of these burn-like lesions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
