    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Incomplete casting can occur due to various reasons. According to Document [15], it can occur when the material freezes before it completely fills the mould cavity. This can be due to the castability and viscosity of the material. Document [7] suggests that improper pattern orientation relative to the sprue and direction of the casting arm motion can lead to incomplete casting. Document [6] mentions that the casting materials used can also affect the completeness of the casting. However, none of the documents provided directly link incomplete casting to a more porous investment in the mould, a narrow sprue diameter, a hollow sprue pin, or a large reservoir.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
