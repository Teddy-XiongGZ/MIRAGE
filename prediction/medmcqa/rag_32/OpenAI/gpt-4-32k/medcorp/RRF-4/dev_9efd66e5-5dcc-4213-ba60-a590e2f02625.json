    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Functional appliances are used in orthodontics to correct Class II malocclusions, which are often characterized by a retrognathic or 'receding' mandible, as stated in multiple documents. This means the mandible is positioned backwards relative to the maxilla. Document [0] mentions that functional appliances are a specific method of therapy among orthodontic corrective procedures for class II malocclusions. Document [2] and [4] also mention that functional appliances are frequently used in the treatment of Class II division 1 malocclusions. However, these appliances are most effective in growing individuals, as they can influence the growth of the mandible. In mature individuals, where growth has largely ceased, the effectiveness of these appliances would be limited, as stated in Document [3]. Therefore, the use of functional appliances would not be indicated in a mature individual with a retrognathic mandible. As for the maxilla being prognathic, this would indicate a Class III malocclusion, not a Class II. Finally, the presence of severe crowding is not a specific indication for the use of functional appliances.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
