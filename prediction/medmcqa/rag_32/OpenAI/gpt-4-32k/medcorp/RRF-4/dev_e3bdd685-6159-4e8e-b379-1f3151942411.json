    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The commissures of the brain are bundles of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres. According to Document [0], there are five commissures in the brain: the anterior commissure, posterior commissure, corpus callosum, commissure of fornix (hippocampal commissure), and habenular commissure. Document [10] states that the corpus callosum is the largest commissural tract in the human brain. The options provided in the question do not include the commissure of Ganser or the commissure of Gudden, which suggests that these are not the largest commissures. Therefore, the largest commissure of the brain is the corpus callosum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Corpus callosum\"}"
