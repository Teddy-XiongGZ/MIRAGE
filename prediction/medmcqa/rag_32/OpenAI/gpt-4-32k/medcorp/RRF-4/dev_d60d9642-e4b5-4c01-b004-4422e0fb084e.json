    "The documents mention that the organic component of bone is mainly composed of collagen. Document [0] states that approximately 30% of the acellular component of bone consists of organic matter. Document [1] mentions that the bone organic compartment is a minor and complex structural entity, surrounding and supporting cells. Document [4] states that the Organic Bone Matrix is predominantly type I collagen. Document [5] mentions that the organic unmineralized matrix includes mainly type 1 collagen and which comprises about one third of total bone weight. Document [10] states that Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic collagen fibers, also known as ossein. Based on these documents, the organic component of bone is predominantly composed of collagen, and it constitutes about 30% of the total bone weight. Therefore, the answer choice that best fits this information is D. 90% collagen protein. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that the organic component of bone is mainly composed of collagen.
