    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms include chronic liver failure, muscle weakness, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, and decreased pH, which suggest a glycogen storage disease. The normal blood lactate and uric acid levels rule out type I glycogen storage disease, which is characterized by elevated levels of these substances. The response to glucagon, which raises blood glucose levels after meals but not after an overnight fast, suggests a defect in glycogenolysis, the process of breaking down glycogen into glucose. This process is facilitated by the debranching enzyme. The liver biopsy showing increased glycogen in the liver further supports this conclusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Debranching enzyme\"}"
