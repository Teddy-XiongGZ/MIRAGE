    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Pes anserinus is a structure formed by the conjoined tendons of three muscles: the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus. These tendons insert onto the anteromedial (front and inside) surface of the proximal tibia. The question is asking for a similar structure in another part of the body. The TMJ (temporomandibular joint) is a joint, not a conjoined tendon structure. The parotid and submandibular glands are salivary glands, not structures formed by conjoined tendons. The cheek is a facial feature composed of skin, fat, and muscles, but it does not have a structure similar to the Pes anserinus. Therefore, none of the options provided have a similar structure to the Pes anserinus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
