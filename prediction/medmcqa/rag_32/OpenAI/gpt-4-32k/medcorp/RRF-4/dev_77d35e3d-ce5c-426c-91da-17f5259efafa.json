    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GTCS stands for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. According to Document [0], generalized tonic-clonic seizures are rarely seen in infants younger than age 2. When it comes to diagnosing the cause of seizures in infants, imaging studies of the brain are typically performed. Transcranial ultrasound, mentioned in option A, can provide valuable information about the brain, especially in premature infants. However, it may not provide the level of detail needed to identify specific pathologies that could cause seizures. CT Head, mentioned in option B, can provide more detailed images than ultrasound, but it exposes the child to radiation. MRI brain, mentioned in option C, provides the most detailed images of the brain and does not expose the child to radiation. Therefore, MRI brain would be the best investigation to diagnose the pathology causing the seizures. X-ray, mentioned in option D, is not typically used to diagnose brain pathologies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
