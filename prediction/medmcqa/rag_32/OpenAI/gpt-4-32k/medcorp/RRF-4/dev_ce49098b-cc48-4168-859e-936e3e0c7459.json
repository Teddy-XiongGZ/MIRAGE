    "First, I need to understand what Kiesselbach's plexus is. From Document [1], I learned that Kiesselbach's plexus is a vascular network of arteries in the nose. It is formed by the anterior ethmoidal artery, the sphenopalatine artery, the greater palatine artery, and a septal branch of the superior labial artery. Next, I need to identify which of these arteries are not branches of the external carotid artery. From Document [18], I learned that the anterior ethmoidal artery arises from the internal carotid system, while the sphenopalatine, greater palatine, and superior labial arteries are terminal branches of the external carotid system. Therefore, the anterior ethmoidal artery is not a branch of the external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus. So, the answer is B. Anterior ethmoidal artery. Here is the output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I identified the arteries that make up Kiesselbach's plexus. Then, I determined which of these arteries are not branches of the external carotid artery. I found that the anterior ethmoidal artery arises from the internal carotid system, not the external carotid system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
