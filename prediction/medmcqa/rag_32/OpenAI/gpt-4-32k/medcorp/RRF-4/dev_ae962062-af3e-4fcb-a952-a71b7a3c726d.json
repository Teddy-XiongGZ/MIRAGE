    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The posterior palatal seal is an important part of a denture that helps to improve its retention. Document [2] mentions that the incorporation of a posterior palatal seal is important for obtaining optimum retention of the maxillary complete denture. Document [5] also mentions that the most critical element in the retentive design of a maxillary complete denture is a complete and total border seal (complete peripheral seal) in order to achieve 'suction'. The posterior palatal seal is part of this border seal. Therefore, an increased depth in the posterior palatal seal area would likely lead to increased retention of the denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
