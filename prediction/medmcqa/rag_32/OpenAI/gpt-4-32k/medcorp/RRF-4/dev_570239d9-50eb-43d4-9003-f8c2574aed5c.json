    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by systemic activation of blood coagulation, which can lead to both thrombosis and bleeding. The laboratory investigations mentioned in the options are all associated with DIC. However, the question specifically asks for the best investigation to reveal bleeding in DIC. Prothrombin Time (PT) and activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are measures of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of coagulation respectively, and their increase suggests a deficiency in clotting factors, which can lead to bleeding. Fibrinogen is a protein that helps in clot formation, and its decrease can also lead to bleeding. Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs) are produced when a clot is broken down, and their increase is a sign of active clot breakdown, which can lead to bleeding. However, among these, FDPs are the most direct indicator of active clot breakdown and ongoing bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
