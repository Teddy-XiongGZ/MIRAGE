    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is in a state of shock due to bleeding, which means her blood pressure is low. This makes spinal anesthesia a risky choice as it can further lower blood pressure. Sedation and epidural analgesia might not provide sufficient anesthesia for a caesarean section. General anesthesia with propofol followed by maintenance with fluranes could be a good option, but propofol can also cause a drop in blood pressure. On the other hand, ketamine is known to increase blood pressure and heart rate, making it a safer choice for induction in this case. Therefore, general anesthesia with IV induction by ketamine seems to be the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
