    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingivoplasty is a procedure performed to reshape the gingiva and correct deformities. It is often used to eliminate periodontal pockets and create physiological gingival contours. According to the documents, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and desquamative gingivitis can cause deformities in the gingiva that may require gingivoplasty. Erosive lichen planus, a type of inflammatory condition, can also cause gingival lesions and may necessitate gingivoplasty. However, acute herpetic gingivostomatitis is a viral infection that causes inflammation and ulcers in the mouth and gums, but it does not typically cause the kind of gingival deformities that would require gingivoplasty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
