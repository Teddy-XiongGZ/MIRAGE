    "Step 1: Review the question and the potential choices. The question is asking for the statement that is not true about osteoblasts. Step 2: Review the relevant documents for information about each choice. Choice A: Derived from osteoprogenitor cells - Document [8] mentions that osteoblasts are thought to derive from osteogenic stem cells that are closely related to fibroblasts. This suggests that osteoblasts are indeed derived from a type of progenitor cell, which supports the statement in choice A. Choice B: Regulated by BMP - Document [14] mentions that bone regeneration is regulated by the expression of growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), which suggests that osteoblasts could be regulated by BMP. This supports the statement in choice B. Choice C: Have a plasma membrane showing multiple folds - None of the documents provided mention anything about the plasma membrane of osteoblasts having multiple folds. Choice D: Have neuropeptide receptors - Document [20] mentions that osteoblasts have receptors for tissue-specific hormones, as well as many other hormones, cytokines and growth factors, which regulate bone growth, differentiation and metabolism. This suggests that osteoblasts could have neuropeptide receptors, supporting the statement in choice D. Step 3: Based on the information found in the documents, the statement in choice C is the only one that is not supported by the documents. Therefore, it is likely the incorrect statement about osteoblasts. Output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first reviewed the question and the potential choices. Then, I reviewed the relevant documents for information about each choice. I found support for the statements in choices A, B, and D in the documents. However, I did not find any information in the documents to support the statement in choice C. Therefore, I concluded that the statement in choice C is the incorrect statement about osteoblasts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
