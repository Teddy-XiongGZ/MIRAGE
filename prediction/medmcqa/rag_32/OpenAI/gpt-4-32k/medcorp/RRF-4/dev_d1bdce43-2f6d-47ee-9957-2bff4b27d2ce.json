    "The process of sperm formation, also known as spermatogenesis, involves several stages. According to Document [2], the process starts with the mitotic division of spermatogonial stem cells, which are called spermatogonia. These cells differentiate into primary spermatocytes. The primary spermatocyte then divides meiotically into two secondary spermatocytes, which further divide into haploid spermatids. The spermatids are then transformed into spermatozoa (sperm) by the process of spermiogenesis. Therefore, the correct sequential order of sperm formation is: Spermatogonia (1), Spermatocyte (2), Spermatids (3), Spermatozoa (4). So, the answer is D. 1234.
