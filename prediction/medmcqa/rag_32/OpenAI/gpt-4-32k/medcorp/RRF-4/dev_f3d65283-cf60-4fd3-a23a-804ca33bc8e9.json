    "The net filtration pressure is calculated using the Starling equation, which takes into account the hydrostatic and oncotic pressures in the capillaries and interstitium. The equation is as follows: Net Filtration Pressure = (Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure - Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure) - (Capillary Oncotic Pressure - Interstitial Oncotic Pressure) We are given the following values: Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure = 25 mm Hg Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure = 2 mm Hg Interstitial Oncotic Pressure = 7 mm Hg Net Filtration Pressure = 3 mm Hg We need to find the Capillary Oncotic Pressure. Let's denote it as X. So, we can set up the equation as follows: 3 = (25 - 2) - (X - 7) Solving this equation will give us the value of X, which is the Capillary Oncotic Pressure. "
