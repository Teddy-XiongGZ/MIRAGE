    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about the attachment of each group of fibres to the alveolar bone. From Document [1], I learned that the periodontal ligament consists of principal fibres, which include alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, apical, and interradicular on multirooted teeth. However, this document does not specify which of these fibres are attached to the alveolar bone. Document [2] provides the needed information. It states that transseptal fibers extend over the alveolar bone crest and are embedded in the cementum of adjacent teeth, but they do not have an osseous attachment. This means that transseptal fibers are not attached to the alveolar bone. The other groups of fibres (horizontal, oblique, and apical) are not explicitly mentioned as not being attached to the alveolar bone, so I can assume that they are.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
