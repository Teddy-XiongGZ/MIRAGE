    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Continuous murmurs are due to blood flow from a high pressure chamber or vessel to a lower pressure system. They are heard when there is flow through the entire cardiac cycle. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is an abnormal connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, which normally should be closed in infancy. Since aortic pressure is higher than pulmonary pressure, a continuous murmur occurs. This is also the case for coronary AV fistula and pulmonary AV fistula, where there is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins, leading to a continuous murmur. However, VSD with aortic regurgitation does not fit this description. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart, and aortic regurgitation is a condition where the aortic valve doesn't close tightly, causing blood to leak back into the left ventricle. Neither of these conditions would cause a continuous murmur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
