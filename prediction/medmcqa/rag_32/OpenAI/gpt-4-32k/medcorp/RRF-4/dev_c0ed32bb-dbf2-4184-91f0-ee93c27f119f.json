    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why the transport of CO is diffusion limited. Looking at the documents, Document [6] provides the most relevant information. It states that the rate of CO equilibrium across the capillary is slow, and the partial pressure of CO in capillary blood remains close to 0. This indicates that the transport of CO is limited by the alveolar-capillary membrane, not because it binds avidly with Hb, its partial pressure is less, or it is less absorbed in water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Alveolar membrane is less permeable\"}"
