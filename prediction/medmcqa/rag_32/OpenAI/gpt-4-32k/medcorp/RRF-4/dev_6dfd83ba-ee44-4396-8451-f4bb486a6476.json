    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Overload of the denture base would be caused by an element that puts excessive pressure or weight on it. Small bases would not provide enough support for the denture, leading to instability rather than overload. Small teeth would not exert excessive pressure on the base. Large teeth, on the other hand, could potentially exert more pressure on the base, but the documents do not provide information to support this. However, too large bases could potentially cause overload as they may not fit properly and could exert excessive pressure on the supporting tissues, as suggested in Document 6.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Too large bases\"}"
