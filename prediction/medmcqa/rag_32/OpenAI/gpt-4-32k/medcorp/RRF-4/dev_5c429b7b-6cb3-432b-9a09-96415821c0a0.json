    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of a supernumerary tooth can lead to crowding and impaction of other teeth, as mentioned in Document [0]. In young children, this is often seen in the maxillary incisor region. The presence of an extra tooth can impede the eruption of adjacent additional or normal teeth. Therefore, the presence of a supernumerary tooth when found must be approached with the appropriate treatment plan. Document [1] describes a case where two supernumerary teeth were involved, which required a combination of orthodontic and surgical treatment. The supernumerary teeth were extracted and the central incisors were aligned with a bracket appliance. Document [28] also describes a case where supernumerary teeth were extracted and the permanent first incisors were aligned with removable appliances. Based on these documents, it seems that the appropriate treatment for a young patient with a supernumerary tooth and crowding would be extraction of the supernumerary tooth followed by orthodontic treatment to align the other teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
