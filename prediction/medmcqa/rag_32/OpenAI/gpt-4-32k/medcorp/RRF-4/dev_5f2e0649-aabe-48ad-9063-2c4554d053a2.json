    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The posterior triangle of the neck is a region of the neck with specific boundaries and contains certain structures. According to Document [21], the posterior triangle is bounded by the sternocleidomastoid and the trapezius muscles, and the clavicle. It does not mention the presence of the phrenic nerve, subclavian nerve, external jugular vein, or hypoglossal nerve. However, Document [1] mentions that the external jugular vein is located within the posterior triangle, so option C can be eliminated. The hypoglossal nerve is not mentioned in any of the documents in relation to the posterior triangle, so it is likely the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hypoglossal nerve\"}"
