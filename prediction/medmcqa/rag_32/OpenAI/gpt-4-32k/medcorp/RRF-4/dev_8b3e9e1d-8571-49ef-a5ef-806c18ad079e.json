    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to identify what an ultrashort acting barbiturate is. From Document [2], I understand that ultrashort acting barbiturates have a duration of action of about 30 minutes. Examples given include thiopentone and methohexitone. Now, I need to match this information with the provided choices. Meprobamate is not mentioned in the documents, so I can't confirm it as an ultrashort acting barbiturate. Pentobarbitone, according to Document [7], is a short-acting barbiturate, not ultrashort. Phenobarbitone, as per Document [14], is a long-acting barbiturate. Therefore, the only remaining option that matches the information from the documents is Thiopentone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Thiopentone\"}"
