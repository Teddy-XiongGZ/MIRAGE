    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a 10-year-old boy with a complicated crown fracture and abscess formation in tooth 12, which has an immature blunderbuss canal. Tooth 11 has complete root formation but is non-vital. The management of such a case would involve addressing both the abscess and the non-vital teeth. For tooth 12, since it is immature, apexification or revascularization could be considered. However, revascularization is often preferred in immature teeth as it can promote continued root development. For tooth 11, since it is non-vital and has complete root formation, root canal treatment would be the appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
