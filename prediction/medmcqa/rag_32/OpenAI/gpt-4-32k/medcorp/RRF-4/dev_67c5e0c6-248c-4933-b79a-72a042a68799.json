    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the primary effect of tongue movement. The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth, and its movement is primarily involved in various functions such as speech, swallowing, and taste. It doesn't primarily affect the palatoglossus arch, facial musculature, cheeks, or lips. However, the tongue does interact with these structures during certain activities. For example, during speech, the tongue moves to different positions in the oral cavity to articulate sounds, which may involve contact with the palatoglossus arch, lips, and cheeks. But these are secondary effects, not the primary function of tongue movement. Therefore, none of the options provided in the question accurately represent the primary effect of tongue movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
