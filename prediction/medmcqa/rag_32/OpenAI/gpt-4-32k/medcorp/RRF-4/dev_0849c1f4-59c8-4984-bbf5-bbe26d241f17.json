    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tipping of a tooth refers to the movement of the tooth in a certain direction due to applied force. This movement would cause the fibers of the periodontal ligament (PDL) on one side of the tooth to compress, while the fibers on the opposite side stretch. This is due to the fact that the PDL fibers are responsible for attaching the tooth to the alveolar bone, and any movement of the tooth would result in changes to these fibers. Therefore, the answer should be that half of the fibers are compressed and half are stretched.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
