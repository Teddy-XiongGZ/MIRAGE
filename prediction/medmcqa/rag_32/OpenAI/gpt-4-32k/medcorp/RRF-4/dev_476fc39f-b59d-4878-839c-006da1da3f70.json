    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the initial evaluation for a woman who is at 42 weeks of gestation, which is considered a postdated or postterm pregnancy. According to Document [0], a postterm pregnancy is defined as \u2265 42 weeks + 0 days of gestation. Document [1] suggests that gestational age must be accurately determined through the use of historical, physical, and laboratory data. This could include reviewing the woman's previous menstrual history. However, Document [14] suggests that early dating of the pregnancy is important for accurately determining when a pregnancy is late- or postterm, and first-trimester ultrasonography should be performed if clinical dating is uncertain. Therefore, an ultrasound (USG) would be a more accurate method for evaluating the gestational age and condition of the fetus in a postterm pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. USG\"}"
