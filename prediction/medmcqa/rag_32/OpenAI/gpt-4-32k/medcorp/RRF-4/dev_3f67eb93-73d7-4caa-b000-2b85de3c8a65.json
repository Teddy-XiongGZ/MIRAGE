    "Based on the provided documents, pericytes are described as cells that wrap around the endothelial cells that line the capillaries throughout the body (Document [0]). They are found in the central nervous system (Document [2]), in the brain (Document [3]), and in the retina (Document [4]). They are also mentioned to be present in all vascularized tissues, surrounding blood vessel walls (Document [11]). However, there is no specific mention of pericytes being found in the thymus, gallbladder, or along with heparin on the surface of mast cells. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided documents is that pericytes are found around capillaries. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Review the provided documents for information about the location of pericytes. 2. Identify that pericytes are found around the endothelial cells that line the capillaries throughout the body. 3. Note that pericytes are present in all vascularized tissues, surrounding blood vessel walls. 4. Compare this information with the answer choices. 5. Determine that the answer choice that matches the information in the documents is that pericytes are found around capillaries. The final output in json format is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first reviewed the provided documents for information about the location of pericytes.
