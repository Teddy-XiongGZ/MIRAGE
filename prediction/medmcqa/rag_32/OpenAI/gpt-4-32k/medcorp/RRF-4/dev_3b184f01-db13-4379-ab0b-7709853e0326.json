    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case of jaundice with 50% direct bilirubin and normal liver function tests (LFTs). Direct bilirubin, also known as conjugated bilirubin, is usually increased in conditions involving hepatocellular injury or cholestasis. Gilbert syndrome and Glucuronyl transferase deficiency are associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, so they can be ruled out. Primary biliary cirrhosis typically presents with abnormal LFTs, particularly elevated alkaline phosphatase, which is not the case here. Rotor syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intermittent jaundice and predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia with normal LFTs, which matches the case described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
