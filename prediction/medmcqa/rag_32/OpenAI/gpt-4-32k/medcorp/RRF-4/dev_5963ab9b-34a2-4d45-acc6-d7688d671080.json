Giant cell arteritis is a condition that causes inflammation of the arteries, often in the temporal region, and can cause symptoms such as headache and tenderness in the temporal region. The other options do not seem to align with the symptoms presented. Temporal aneurysm would likely present with more severe symptoms. Granulomatous giant cell lesions are typically associated with conditions like tuberculosis, which doesn't align with the symptoms presented.
