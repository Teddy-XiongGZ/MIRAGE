    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I will look for information about each of the potential choices in the provided documents. Starting with Parkinsonism, Document [22] mentions that Parkinsonian resting tremor was examined in the lips, jaw, tongue, and index finger. This suggests that Parkinsonism can cause tongue tremors. Next, for Alcohol, Document [26] mentions that essential tremor is worsened by alcohol. Since essential tremor can affect the tongue as mentioned in Document [0], it can be inferred that alcohol can cause tongue tremors. For Thyrotoxicosis, there is no direct mention in the documents, but Document [27] mentions that tremors can be heightened by hyperthyroidism. Since thyrotoxicosis is a condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone in the body, it can be inferred that it can cause tongue tremors. Lastly, for General paresis, there is no mention in the documents. Therefore, without any evidence to suggest that General paresis can cause tongue tremors, it is the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
