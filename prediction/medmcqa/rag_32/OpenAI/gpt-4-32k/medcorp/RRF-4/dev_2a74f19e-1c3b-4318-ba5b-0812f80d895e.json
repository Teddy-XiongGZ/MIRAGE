    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Randomization in a clinical trial is a method used to reduce bias and ensure that the groups being compared are similar in all respects except for the intervention being studied. This is confirmed by Document [1], Document [2], and Document [6]. Therefore, options A, B, and C are true. However, randomization does not necessarily increase the external validity of a trial. External validity refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other situations and to other people. While randomization can help ensure that the study's results are valid within the context of the study, it does not guarantee that the results will be applicable to a broader population (external validity). This is because the participants in a randomized clinical trial are often not representative of the general population, as confirmed by Document [26].\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
