    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the statement that is not true according to the 2010 ACLS guidelines. Document [0] provides a general overview of the 2010 ACLS guidelines, but it does not provide specific details about the options given in the question. Document [3] mentions that defibrillation should be done immediately in cases of ventricular fibrillation, but it does not specify the energy level, so we cannot confirm or deny option A. Document [18] mentions noncompliance with ACLS guidelines, but it does not specify which guidelines are not being followed, so it does not help us answer the question. None of the other documents provide specific information about the options given in the question. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the question based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unable to answer based on the provided documents\"}"
