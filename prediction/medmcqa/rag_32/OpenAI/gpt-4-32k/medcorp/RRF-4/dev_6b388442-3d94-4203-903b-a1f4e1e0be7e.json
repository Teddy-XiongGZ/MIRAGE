    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [2] explains that when the fit of a removable complete denture is diminished as a result of progressive alveolar bone reduction, relining or rebasing might be indicated. This suggests that both relining and rebasing can be done when there is excessive alveolar bone loss. Document [25] also mentions that wearing dentures can lead to additional bone resorption, and that from time to time the denture has to be rebased or relined due to the changes in contour of the jaw. This further supports the idea that relining and rebasing can be done in the case of alveolar bone loss. The other options do not seem to be directly supported by the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
