    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the best biochemical description of glucose. Looking at the options, option A suggests that glucose is a ketose sugar, but this is incorrect as glucose is an aldose sugar. Option B suggests that glucose is present in L form in all biosystems, but this is also incorrect as glucose is typically found in the D-isomeric form in biological systems. Option D suggests that glucose is a disaccharide, but this is incorrect as glucose is a monosaccharide. Option C suggests that the C-4 epimer of glucose is galactose, which is correct as glucose and galactose are C-4 epimers, meaning they differ only in the configuration around carbon 4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
