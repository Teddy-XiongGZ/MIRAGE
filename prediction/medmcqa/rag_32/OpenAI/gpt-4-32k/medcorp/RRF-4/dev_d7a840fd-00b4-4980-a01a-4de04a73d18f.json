    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with severe hypercalcemia, which is a common complication in malignancies like lung cancer. The first step in managing hypercalcemia is usually hydration with intravenous fluids to promote renal calcium excretion. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, can also be used to increase calcium excretion in the kidneys. Bisphosphonates are typically used after initial fluid therapy to inhibit bone resorption and lower serum calcium levels. Immediate hemodialysis is usually reserved for severe, life-threatening hypercalcemia that is not responsive to other treatments. Chemotherapy would be a treatment for the underlying cancer, but not the immediate hypercalcemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
