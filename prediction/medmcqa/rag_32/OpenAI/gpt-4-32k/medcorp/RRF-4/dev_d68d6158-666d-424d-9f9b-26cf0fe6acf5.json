    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zellweger syndrome is a peroxisomal disorder. Peroxisomes are involved in the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). In Zellweger syndrome, this process is disrupted, leading to an accumulation of VLCFAs. Therefore, in a patient with Zellweger syndrome, we would expect to see an accumulation of VLCFAs in the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Long chain fatty acid\"}"
