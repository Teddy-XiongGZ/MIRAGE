    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the under-5 mortality rate in the world by 2010. This information can be found in Document [6], which states that the global under-5 mortality rate fell from 88 to 57 deaths per 1,000 live births between 1990 and 2010. However, the answer choices are given in millions, not in deaths per 1,000 live births. Therefore, we need to find the total number of under-5 deaths in 2010. This information is also provided in Document [6], which states that the annual number of under-five deaths fell from 12.0 to 7.6 million between 1990 and 2010.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
