    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific type of porosity that forms when solid grains and gas bubbles nucleate simultaneously as the metal freezes at the mold walls. Looking at the documents, none of them directly mention a type of porosity that fits this exact description. However, Document [1] mentions gas porosity, which is the formation of bubbles within the casting after it has cooled. This seems to align with the process described in the question, where gas bubbles form as the metal freezes. Therefore, the closest match to the process described in the question would be gas porosity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Gas inclusion porosity\"}"
