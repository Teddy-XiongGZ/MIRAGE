    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not mention any association between exclusive breastfeeding and hemolysis due to Vitamin K deficiency, evening colic, golden color stool, or prolongation of physiological jaundice. However, it is known that Vitamin K is necessary for the synthesis of certain proteins required for blood clotting. Newborns are at risk for Vitamin K deficiency bleeding because human milk is low in Vitamin K. Therefore, it is possible that exclusive breastfeeding could be associated with hemolysis due to Vitamin K deficiency. Evening colic, golden color stool, and prolongation of physiological jaundice are common in breastfed infants, but these conditions are not necessarily caused by exclusive breastfeeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
