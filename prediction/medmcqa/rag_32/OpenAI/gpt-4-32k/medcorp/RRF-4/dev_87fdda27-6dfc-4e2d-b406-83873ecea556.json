    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the rate of factor replacement for a hemophilia B patient who needs major surgery. According to Document [0], the goal is to achieve 80% to 100% factor activity in patients with life-threatening conditions, which would include major surgery. However, this document does not specify the frequency of administration. Document [9] suggests that these levels should be obtained 30 minutes before the onset of surgery and maintained for 2 to 7 days after surgery. The timing of subsequent doses is determined based on factor half-life which is typically 8 to 12 hours. This suggests that the factor replacement should be done every 8 to 12 hours. Therefore, the answer should be 80-100 units/kg every 12 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
