    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best site to obtain a specimen for diagnosing CMV by PCR in a child presenting with microcephaly, hepatomegaly, and periventricular calcification. Document [0] mentions that CSF was used to assay for CMV in infants, but it was not the most sensitive method. Document [1] mentions that PCR can detect CMV DNA in blood samples. Document [4] mentions that a PCR for CMV-DNA in the blood on the Guthrie card demonstrated retrospectively in both cases that the infection was congenital. Document [13] mentions that the diagnosis of congenital CMV infection was established by detecting the virus using viral isolation in tissue culture, polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification in urine samples. Document [17] mentions that the diagnosis of CMV infection was performed by measurement of serum anti-CMV specific Ig M and IgG titers and PCR method in blood and/or urine. Document [20] mentions that the diagnosis of CMV infection was confirmed by PCR in CSF and brain biopsies. Document [27] mentions that the diagnosis of CMV infection was performed by measurement of serum anti-CMV specific Ig M and IgG titers and PCR method in blood and/or urine. Based on these documents, it seems that urine is the most commonly used and reliable specimen for diagnosing CMV by PCR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
