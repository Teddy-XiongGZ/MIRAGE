    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the easiest type of third molar extraction. The documents do not directly state which type of third molar extraction is the easiest. However, we can infer that the difficulty of extraction is likely related to the position and angle of the tooth. A mesioangular third molar is angled towards the front of the mouth, a horizontal third molar is lying on its side, a vertical third molar is in the normal position but has not fully erupted, and a distoangular third molar is angled towards the back of the mouth. Considering these positions, a vertical third molar would likely be the easiest to extract as it is in the normal position and just has not fully erupted.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
