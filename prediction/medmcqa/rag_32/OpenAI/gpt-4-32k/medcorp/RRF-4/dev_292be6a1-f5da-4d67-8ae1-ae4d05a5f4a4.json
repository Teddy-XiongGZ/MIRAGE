    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The numbness experienced by the patient while shaving after a parotidectomy could be due to damage to a nerve that provides sensation to the face. The facial nerve is primarily a motor nerve controlling muscles of facial expression, so it's less likely to be the cause of numbness. The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve and provides sensation to the lower face, but it's not typically involved in a parotidectomy. The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve and provides sensation to the ear and surrounding area, but it's also not typically involved in a parotidectomy. The greater auricular nerve, however, provides sensation to the ear and the area behind and below the ear, which is the area typically affected by a parotidectomy. Therefore, damage to the greater auricular nerve during a parotidectomy could cause numbness in the area where the patient shaves.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Greater auricular\"}"
