    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentigerous cysts are benign odontogenic cysts that are associated with the crowns of permanent teeth. They are usually characterized as unilocular radiolucent lesions and are rarely seen during childhood. The standard treatment for this lesion is enucleation and extraction of the involved tooth. However, marsupialization of dentigerous cyst has also been advocated, once in many cases it can maintain the impacted tooth in its cavity and promotes its eruption. This report describes a case of a 13-year-old girl with a large dentigerous cyst associated with mandibular right second molar. The cyst was marsupialized and the patient was checked weekly. Two months after the surgical procedure the impacted tooth was completely erupted without orthodontic traction and therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Expose the crown and keep it exposed\"}"
