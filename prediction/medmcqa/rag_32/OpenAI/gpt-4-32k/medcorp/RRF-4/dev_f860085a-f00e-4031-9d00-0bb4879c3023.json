    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about each of the answer choices. Step 2: Document [26] mentions that nasal fractures are often associated with physical altercations, falls, sports injuries, and motor vehicle accidents. This doesn't directly address any of the answer choices, but it provides some context. Step 3: Document [1] and [16] suggest that nasal fractures are usually diagnosed through physical examination rather than imaging, and treatment often involves waiting for swelling to subside before making any interventions. This could potentially relate to answer choice B. Step 4: Document [5] and [7] discuss the potential complications of nasal fractures, including nasal septal hematoma and deformities. This could potentially relate to answer choice C and D. Step 5: Document [31] mentions that reduction of displaced bone fragments should occur within two weeks of injury, as the nasal bones will heal and fixate. This directly contradicts answer choice B, which suggests that nasal fractures may need to be reduced for a few weeks. Based on this analysis, the statement in answer choice B is not true according to the provided documents.
