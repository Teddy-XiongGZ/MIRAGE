    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about Pseudomonas being strict aerobes. Step 2: Review the documents for information about Pseudomonas' ability to grow in disinfectants in hospitals. Step 3: Review the documents for information about Pseudomonas infections being mostly due to endogenous sources. Step 4: Review the documents for information about Pseudomonas being the most common organism in burn patients. From Document [0], we learn that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen of clinical relevance, suggesting it can infect humans under certain conditions. However, this document does not provide specific information about the options given in the question. Document [1] discusses the antimicrobial activity of certain compounds against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it does not provide information relevant to the question. Document [15] discusses a case of Pseudomonas septicaemia in previously healthy children, suggesting that Pseudomonas infections can occur in individuals without known predisposing causes. This could contradict option C, which states that Pseudomonas infection is mostly due to an endogenous source. Document [26] discusses the causative bacteria of pneumonia in the elderly, mentioning Pseudomonas aeruginosa as one of the bacteria. However, it does not provide information relevant to the question. None of the documents provide information about Pseudomonas being strict aerobes, being able to grow in disinfectants in hospitals, or being the most common organism in burn patients. Based on the information available in the documents, the statement that seems least likely to be true is option C: \"Infection is mostly due to endogenous source\". This is because Document [15] suggests that Pseudomonas infections can occur in individuals without known predisposing causes, which contradicts the idea that infection is mostly due to an endogenous source. Therefore, the answer is C: \"Infection is mostly due to endogenous source\".
