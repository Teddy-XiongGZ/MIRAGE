    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of accessory canals in the tooth that is second most common after the apical third. From the documents, it is clear that the apical third is the most common location for accessory canals. However, to find the second most common location, we need to look for mentions of the middle and coronal thirds. Document [5] mentions that most accessory canals are located in the apical third, but does not provide information about the other locations. Document [24] mentions that lateral canals were most common in the apical third, but again does not provide information about the other locations. Document [27] also mentions that the majority of roots of all molars contained one or two apical foramina and the apical third had the highest prevalence of lateral canals. This suggests that the apical third is the most common location for accessory canals, but it does not provide information about the second most common location. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot definitively determine whether the middle or coronal third is the second most common location for accessory canals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of the above\"}"
