    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the changes in the insulin structure that would cause the least change in its function. From Document [5], it is clear that modifications near the N-terminal glycine of the A-chain in insulin, which includes A1, lead to variations in the biological activity of insulin. Therefore, interchange of A1 & A4 (option A) would likely cause significant changes in insulin function. Document [15] mentions that mutations of the insulin-receptor gene lead to an alteration of structure or reduced number of insulin receptors, which results in reduced binding of insulin. This suggests that any change in the structure of insulin, such as breaking disulphide linkages (option D), could potentially affect its function. Document [22] mentions that binding of ligand to the \u03b1-chains of the IR dimeric ectodomain shifts it from an inverted V-shape to a T-shaped conformation, suggesting that any change in the structure could potentially affect its function. Therefore, the least likely change to affect insulin function would be the interchange of A5 & A6 (option C), as these are not specifically mentioned in the documents as being critical to insulin function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
