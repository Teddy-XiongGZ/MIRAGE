    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Choriocarcinoma is a type of cancer that can develop after a molar pregnancy, which is also known as a hydatidiform mole. Rising hCG levels are a sign of choriocarcinoma because this type of cancer produces this hormone. An increase in uterus size can also indicate the development of choriocarcinoma, as the cancerous cells can cause the uterus to enlarge. Theca lutein cysts are often associated with molar pregnancies and can indicate a higher risk of developing choriocarcinoma. However, a sub urethral nodule is not typically associated with choriocarcinoma or molar pregnancies. This type of nodule is usually associated with conditions affecting the urinary tract.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
