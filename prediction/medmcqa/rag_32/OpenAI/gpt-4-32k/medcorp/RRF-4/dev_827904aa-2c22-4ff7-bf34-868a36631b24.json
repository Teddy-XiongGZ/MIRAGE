    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reed-Sternberg cells are the characteristic cells of Hodgkin's lymphoma. According to the documents, these cells are usually derived from B lymphocytes. Document [0] suggests that the cell line derived from Hodgkin's disease indicates a B-lymphocyte origin. Document [2] also states that Reed-Sternberg cells with B-cell phenotypes have rearranged VH genes, indicating that these cells arise from B cells. Document [5] and [6] also support the idea that Reed-Sternberg cells are usually of B cell origin. Therefore, the answer should be B cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
