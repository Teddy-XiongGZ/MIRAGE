    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of cell junctions that allow the exchange of cytoplasmic molecules between two cells. From the documents, it is clear that gap junctions directly connect the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules, ions and electrical impulses to directly pass through a regulated gate between cells. Tight junctions, on the other hand, hold cells of a same tissue together and prevent movement of water and water-soluble molecules between cells. Anchoring junctions provide strength and flexibility to cells, and focal junctions are not mentioned in the documents. Therefore, the correct answer is gap junctions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
