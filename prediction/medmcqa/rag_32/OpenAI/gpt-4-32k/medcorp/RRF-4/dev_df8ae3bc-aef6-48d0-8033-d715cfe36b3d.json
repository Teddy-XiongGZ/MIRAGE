    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most accurate diagnostic test for rabies using a corneal impression. Document [1] and [3] suggest that a corneal impression test can be used for the diagnosis of rabies. Document [22] mentions that reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used for the diagnosis of rabies and it can detect the rabies virus earlier as compared to other tests. Therefore, RT-PCR seems to be the most accurate test for the diagnosis of rabies using a corneal impression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
