    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the next step in management for a 2-year-old female who has been successfully treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI). According to Document [1], following a UTI, investigation should be performed to identify an underlying urinary tract anomaly. Document [7] also mentions that in children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection. However, the question does not mention if the child had a fever. Document [20] suggests that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) only for patients with an abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS). However, the question does not provide information about the severity of the UTI or any abnormal findings in the child. Therefore, based on the information provided in the question and the documents, the next step in management would be to perform an ultrasound to check for any underlying urinary tract anomalies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ultrasound\"}"
