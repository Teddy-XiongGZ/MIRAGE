    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The vitreous humor is a fluid contained in the eye. According to Document [1], it contains various electrolytes, including sodium and potassium. However, the document does not specify which of these electrolytes is present in higher concentrations compared to blood. Document [0] mentions that the blood phencyclidine concentrations were greater than the vitreous humor phencyclidine concentrations, but this does not provide information about the specific electrolytes in the question. Document [19] mentions a postmortem rise of potassium in the vitreous humor, which could suggest that potassium is present in higher concentrations in the vitreous humor compared to blood. Document [29] mentions that ascorbic acid, also known as vitamin C or ascorbate, is highly concentrated in ocular tissues, especially in vitreous humor. This suggests that ascorbate might be present in higher concentrations in the vitreous humor compared to blood. Therefore, based on the information in the documents, it seems that the vitreous humor has a high concentration of ascorbate compared to blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Ascorbate\"}"
