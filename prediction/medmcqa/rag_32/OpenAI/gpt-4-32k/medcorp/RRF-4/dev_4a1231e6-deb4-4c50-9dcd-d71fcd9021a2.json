    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament is the connective tissue that joins the outer layer of the tooth root, being the cementum, to the surrounding alveolar bone. Sharpey's fibres are the terminal ends of principal fibres (of the periodontal ligament) that insert into the cementum and into the periosteum of the alveolar bone. Therefore, the fibres of the periodontal ligament that are embedded in the bone are Sharpey's fibres.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Sharpey's fibres\"}"
