    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pre-oxygenation is a crucial step before tracheal intubation to increase the patient's oxygen reserves and delay the onset of desaturation during apnea. According to Document [11], three minutes of spontaneous breathing at FiO2=1 allows denitrogenation with FAO2 close to 95% in patients with normal lung function. This can extend the tolerable apnea time to almost 10 minutes after 3 minutes of classic pre-oxygenation. Document [8] also mentions that denitrogenation of the lungs should be performed with 100% oxygen via a facemask for three minutes before administration of an induction dose. Therefore, the time required for pre-oxygenation before tracheal intubation is 3 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
