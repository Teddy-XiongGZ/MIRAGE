    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cholesterol is carried in the blood by lipoproteins. There are different types of lipoproteins, including VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein), LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein), HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein), and Chylomicrons. Each of these lipoproteins has a different function in the body. VLDL carries triglycerides from the liver to the body's tissues. LDL, often referred to as 'bad cholesterol', carries cholesterol from the liver to the body's tissues. HDL, often referred to as 'good cholesterol', carries cholesterol from the body's tissues back to the liver. Chylomicrons carry dietary fat from the intestine to the body's tissues. According to Document [0], cholesterol is the major component of cell membrane structures which determines their structure and permeability. This suggests that LDL, which carries cholesterol from the liver to the body's tissues, is the most important carrier of cholesterol in plasma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
