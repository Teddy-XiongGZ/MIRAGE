However, the patient is negative for HBsAg, which means he is not currently infected with Hepatitis B. The presence of Anti-HCV indicates a past or current Hepatitis C infection. Given these results, the next step would be to confirm the current presence of Hepatitis C virus in the patient's blood. This can be done using a PCR test for Hepatitis C virus, which can detect the virus's RNA and confirm a current infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
