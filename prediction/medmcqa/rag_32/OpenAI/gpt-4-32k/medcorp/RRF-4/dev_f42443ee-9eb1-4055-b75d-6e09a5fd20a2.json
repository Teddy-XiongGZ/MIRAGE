    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optimal landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation is the point where the root canal system is sealed to prevent bacterial re-entry. This is typically the apical constriction, also known as the minor diameter, which is the narrowest part of the canal. The cementodentinal junction is not typically used as a landmark for termination of these procedures. Therefore, the answer should be the apical constriction or minor diameter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
