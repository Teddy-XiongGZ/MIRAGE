    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cryosurgery involves the use of extreme cold to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue. According to Document [26], the coldest tissue temperature is the prime factor in cell death and this should be -50 degrees C in neoplastic tissue. This indicates that cell death occurs during cryosurgery, but not at -20\u00b0C as stated in option C. Document [18] mentions that patients undergoing cryosurgery usually experience redness and minor-to-moderate localized pain, which can be alleviated by oral administration of mild analgesics. This suggests that general anesthesia is not typically required, ruling out option D. Cells do not get evaporated during cryosurgery, they freeze and then die, so option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because cells do die during cryosurgery, they don't just freeze.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
