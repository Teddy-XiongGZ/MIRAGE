    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factor that affects the strength of a gypsum investment. Document [0] mentions that the strength of gypsum-bonded investment is not significantly affected by temperature or time, but it does not mention any specific element that affects its strength. Document [1] and Document [2] discuss the composition of gypsum-bonded investment but do not directly link any specific element to its strength. Document [4] mentions that the strength of gypsum-bonded investments is mainly influenced by the state of the calcium sulfates, not by the transformation of silicas. Document [5] also mentions that there is no correlation between the compressive strength of the gypsum-bonded investments and other factors. Document [8] mentions that the strength of gypsum-bonded investment is temperature sensitive, but it does not mention any specific element that affects its strength. Document [16] mentions that the strength of gypsum-bonded investments is affected by the addition of different reducing agents, but it does not mention any specific element that affects its strength. Document [24] mentions that the addition of soluble phosphorus can affect the strength of gypsum-bonded investments. However, none of the documents mention that the strength of a gypsum investment is dependent on carbon content, silica content, or copper. Therefore, the most logical answer would be that the strength of a gypsum investment is dependent on gypsum itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Gypsum\"}"
