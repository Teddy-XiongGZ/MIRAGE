    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Option A is true, as mentioned in Document 1, the guide RNA (gRNA) recognizes the target sequence in the gene of interest through a complementary base pair, ensuring that the Cas-9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome. Option B is also true, as mentioned in Document 1, the double-stranded break made by the Cas-9 enzyme is repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) cellular mechanisms. Option C seems to have a typo, but if we assume it means 'Cas9 enzyme is used in CRISPR gene editing', then it is also true, as mentioned in Document 23, Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of these\"}"
