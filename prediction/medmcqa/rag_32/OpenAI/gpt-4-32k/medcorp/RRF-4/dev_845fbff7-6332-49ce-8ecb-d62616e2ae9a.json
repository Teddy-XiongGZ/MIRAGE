    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The keyhole-shaped visual field defect is not mentioned in any of the documents. However, we can infer from the documents that different types of visual field defects are associated with lesions in different parts of the visual pathway. For example, a lesion in the optic disk can cause a central scotoma (Document 18), a lesion in the optic chiasma can cause bitemporal hemianopia (Document 31), a lesion in the lateral geniculate body can cause homonymous hemianopia (Document 31), and a lesion in the occipital lobe can cause homonymous hemianopia or quadrantanopia (Document 11). Since none of these defects are described as keyhole-shaped, it's difficult to determine the correct answer based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unable to determine from the provided documents\"}"
