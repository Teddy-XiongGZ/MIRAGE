    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The binding of eukaryotic mRNA to ribosomes is facilitated by certain factors. According to Document [2], eukaryote initiation factors elF4F and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) recognize the 5' capped mRNA and recruit the 43S ribosome complex at that location. Document [21] also mentions that the eIF4F complex supports the cap-dependent translation initiation process. The cap end of the mRNA is brought to the complex where the 43S ribosomal complex can bind and scan the mRNA for the start codon. Therefore, the capping of the mRNA plays a crucial role in the binding of eukaryotic mRNA to ribosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
