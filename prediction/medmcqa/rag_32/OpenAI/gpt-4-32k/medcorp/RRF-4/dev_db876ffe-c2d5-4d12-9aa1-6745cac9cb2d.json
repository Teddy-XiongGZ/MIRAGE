    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The video shows a neonate on oxygen with nasal prongs, not intubated, and a nurse inserting a tube through the mouth. The camera zooms in to show the 18 (calibration) mark, and the other (green) end is not connected to anything. This suggests that the tube is not for intubation or respiratory support, as it is not connected to any respiratory equipment. The procedure being done is likely the insertion of a tube into the stomach for feeding or medication administration, which can be done either through the nose (nasogastric) or mouth (orogastric). Since the tube is being inserted through the mouth, the procedure is likely orogastric tube insertion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Orogastric tube inseion\"}"
