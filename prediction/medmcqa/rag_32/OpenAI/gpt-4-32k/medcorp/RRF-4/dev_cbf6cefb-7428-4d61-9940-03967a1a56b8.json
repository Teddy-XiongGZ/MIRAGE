    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mean electrical axis of the heart is the average direction of the electrical activity of the heart during the cardiac cycle. It is usually measured in the frontal plane. An axis of 90 degrees is typically associated with lead aVF, which is oriented towards the apex of the heart. Therefore, the maximum voltage of the R wave would be expected in this lead.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
