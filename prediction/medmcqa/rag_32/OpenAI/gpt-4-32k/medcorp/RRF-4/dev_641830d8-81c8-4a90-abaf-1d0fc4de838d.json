She is also on hormone replacement therapy, which has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The presence of a smooth cyst in the right ovary is concerning. Although the cyst could be benign, the risk factors present in this case make it necessary to further investigate the nature of the cyst. Checking CA-125 levels could be a useful next step, but it is not definitive as CA-125 can be elevated in benign conditions as well.
