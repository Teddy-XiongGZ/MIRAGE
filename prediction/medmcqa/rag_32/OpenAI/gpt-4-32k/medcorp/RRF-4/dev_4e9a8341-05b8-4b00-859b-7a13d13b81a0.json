    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Class II div. 1 malocclusion with a horizontal growth trend indicates that the maxilla is protruding while the mandible is retruding. The goal of treatment would be to restrict the forward growth of the maxilla and stimulate the forward growth of the mandible. According to Document [12], the cervical headgear was found to be effective in correcting Class II malocclusion primarily through maxillary forward growth restriction. Document [19] also supports this, stating that one phase treatment for Class II malocclusion with cervical headgear resulted in correction to Class I molar through restriction of horizontal maxillary growth with continued horizontal mandibular growth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Cervical head gear\"}"
