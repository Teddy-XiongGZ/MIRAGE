    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The neurovascular bundle is a structure that binds nerves and veins (and in some cases arteries and lymphatics) with connective tissue so they travel in tandem through the body. In the leg, the neurovascular bundles are located in different compartments. According to Document [1], the main deep neurovascular bundle at risk is the posterior tibial artery. It lies on the posterior aspect of the tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus muscle, and medial to the belly of flexor hallucis longus muscle. This suggests that the deep posterior compartment of the leg contains a neurovascular bundle. Therefore, the compartment of the leg without a neurovascular bundle is not the deep posterior compartment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Anterior\"}"
