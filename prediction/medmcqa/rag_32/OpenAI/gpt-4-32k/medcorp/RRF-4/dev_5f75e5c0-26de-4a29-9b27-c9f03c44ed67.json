    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with palpitations and a fast pulse, which suggests a tachyarrhythmia. The use of vagal maneuvers and adenosine suggests an attempt to treat a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is a common cause of palpitations. However, the rhythm remains refractory to the maximum dose of adenosine. According to Document [0], when initial management tactics are not successful, it may be appropriate to deviate from standard dosing recommendations. However, the question asks for the next step in management, not necessarily a repeat of the same treatment. Document [4] suggests that unstable patients require emergent electrical cardioversion. Given that the patient's blood pressure is low (80/50 mmHg), this could suggest instability. Therefore, electrical cardioversion could be a reasonable next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Cardioversion\"}"
