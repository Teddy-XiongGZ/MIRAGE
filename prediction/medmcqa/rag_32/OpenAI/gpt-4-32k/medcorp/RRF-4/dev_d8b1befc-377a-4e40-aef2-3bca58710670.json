    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Rinne's test showing air conduction greater than bone conduction on both sides indicates a normal or positive Rinne's test, which is typically associated with normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss. However, the Weber test lateralizing to the right ear suggests that there is some form of hearing loss on the left side, as Weber test lateralizes to the better or 'good' ear in the case of sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, the next logical step would be to perform further tests to confirm the type and degree of hearing loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Schwabach's test\"}"
