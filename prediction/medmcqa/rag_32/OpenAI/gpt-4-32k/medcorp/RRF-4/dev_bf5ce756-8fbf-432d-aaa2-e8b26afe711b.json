    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's complaint is about loose immediate dentures. Immediate dentures are placed immediately after tooth extraction and are meant to be a temporary solution while the patient is waiting for a permanent denture. The healing process after tooth extraction involves the reshaping of the jaw bone and gum tissue, which can cause the immediate denture to become loose. This is a common occurrence and is mentioned in Document [26] which states that patients with immediate dentures did not have greater treatment needs, implying that looseness is a common issue. Therefore, the most likely reason for the looseness of the dentures is the continuous healing of the defect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
