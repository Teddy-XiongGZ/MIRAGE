    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical syndrome due to prolonged heavy alcohol intake. The documents mention several biomarkers associated with alcoholic hepatitis, including microRNAs, cytokeratin-18 fragments, and the AshTest. However, none of the provided options (ALP, AST, LDH, GGT) are specifically mentioned as biomarkers for alcoholic hepatitis. AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is mentioned in the context of alcoholic liver disease and its levels can be elevated in liver damage, but it is not specific to alcoholic hepatitis. Therefore, based on the provided documents and options, AST seems to be the most relevant choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
