    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with cicatrizing skin lesions, hypoplasia of all limbs, diffuse cerebral atrophy, and chorioretinitis. These symptoms suggest a congenital infection. Document [22] mentions chickenpox (VZV) can cause damage to the brain, eye, and body, including hypoplasia of upper/lower extremities and skin lesions. However, it does not mention cicatrizing skin lesions or diffuse cerebral atrophy. Document [7] mentions cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause microcephaly, seizures, hypotonia, and multiple contractures, but it does not mention cicatrizing skin lesions or limb hypoplasia. Document [20] mentions congenital toxoplasmosis can present with severe chorioretinal lesions, microcephaly, and nystagmus, which aligns with some of the patient's symptoms. However, it does not mention cicatrizing skin lesions or limb hypoplasia. Document [1] mentions varicella (VZV) can cause cicatricial skin lesions and cerebral cortical atrophy, but it does not mention limb hypoplasia or chorioretinitis. Document [9] mentions rubella can cause microcephaly, chorioretinitis, and hemiplegias, but it does not mention cicatrizing skin lesions or limb hypoplasia. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the patient's presentation, but VZV seems to align with the most symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
