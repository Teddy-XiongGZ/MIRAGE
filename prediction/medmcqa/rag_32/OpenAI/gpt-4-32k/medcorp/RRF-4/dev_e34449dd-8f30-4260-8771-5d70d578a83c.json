    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a 5 cm ovarian cyst, which is not an uncommon finding in women of reproductive age. The cyst could be functional, related to the menstrual cycle, or it could be a benign or malignant growth. Given the patient's age, history of normal deliveries, and absence of other alarming symptoms such as rapid increase in size, weight loss, or postmenopausal bleeding, a malignant ovarian cyst is less likely. However, it is important to monitor the cyst to see if it resolves on its own, which is common with functional cysts. Therefore, option A, observation and follow-up after 2-3 months, seems reasonable. Option B, checking CA-125 levels, could be considered, but this test is not specific for ovarian cancer and can be elevated in many benign conditions as well. Option C, diagnostic exploratory laparotomy, is too invasive at this stage without more evidence of malignancy. Option D, CECT of pelvis, could provide more information about the cyst, but again may be unnecessary at this stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
