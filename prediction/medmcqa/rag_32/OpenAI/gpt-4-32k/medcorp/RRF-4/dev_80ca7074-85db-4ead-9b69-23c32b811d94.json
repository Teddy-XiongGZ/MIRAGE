    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The halo effect surrounding the root of a tooth on an IOPA X-ray is typically associated with a certain type of lesion or abnormality. Looking at the options, a horizontal root fracture would likely show a clear break in the root, not a halo. Root caries would show up as radiolucent areas, not necessarily a halo. Widening of the periodontal ligament space would show up as an increased space around the root, but not necessarily a halo. Periapical-periostitis, an inflammation of the periosteum and bone around the apex of a tooth root, could potentially cause a halo effect on an X-ray due to the inflammation and changes in the bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Periapical-periostitis\"}"
