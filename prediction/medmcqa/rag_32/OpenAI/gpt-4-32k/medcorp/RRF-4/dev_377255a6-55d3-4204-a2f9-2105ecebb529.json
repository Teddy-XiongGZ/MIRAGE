    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about the complications associated with outlet forceps. Document [7] mentions that outlet forceps delivery is associated with an increased incidence of maternal perineal trauma. Document [8] also mentions that outlet or low forceps was safe for fetal outcome and trauma of the birth canal in comparison to normal vaginal delivery. Document [17] mentions that forceps and vacuum delivery is associated with increased rates of severe perinatal morbidity and mortality compared with Caesarean delivery among women with dystocia. However, none of these documents provide a direct comparison of the complications listed in the answer choices. Therefore, I will need to make an educated guess based on the information available. Given that outlet forceps are used when the baby's head is already at the perineal floor and visible between contractions (as mentioned in Document [14]), it seems reasonable to assume that a cervical tear would be the least likely complication, as the baby's head has already passed through the cervix at this stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
