    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most posteriorly present foramen in the base of the skull. From the documents, we can see that the foramen spinosum, foramen rotundum, and foramen ovale are all part of the sphenoid bone, which is located in the middle cranial fossa. The foramen magnum, however, is part of the occipital bone, which is located in the posterior cranial fossa. Therefore, the foramen magnum is the most posteriorly present foramen in the base of the skull. However, the foramen magnum is not one of the options given in the question. Among the given options, none of them is described as being more posterior than the others. Therefore, the answer should be that they are all at the same level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
