    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Estrogen and progesterone are crucial hormones for maintaining pregnancy. According to Document [0], the levels of these hormones rise continually throughout pregnancy. Document [2] states that during human pregnancy, progesterone is produced in increasingly high amounts by the ovaries and placenta. However, the production of progesterone shifts to the placenta after the 8th week. Document [9] also mentions that the switch from corpus luteum\u2013derived progesterone to placental-derived progesterone is complete at about the eighth week of pregnancy. Therefore, in the first two months of pregnancy, the corpus luteum is the primary source of these hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Corpus luteum\"}"
