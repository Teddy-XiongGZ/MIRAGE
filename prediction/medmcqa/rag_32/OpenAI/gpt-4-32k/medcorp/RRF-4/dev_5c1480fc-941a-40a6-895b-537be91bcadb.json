    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the annual bone loss seen after 1 year in a functional implant. Document [2] states that early crestal bone loss is often observed after the first year of function, followed by minimal bone loss (<=0.2 mm) annually thereafter. Document [3] also mentions that bone loss is an essential factor for implant longevity prognosis and that clinicians should take into account the factor of implant longevity decrease. Document [16] states that the mean annual bone loss on a site level after 3 years of loading was 0.08 mm/year, after 5 years of loading 0.07 mm/year, after 8 years of loading 0.06 mm/year, after 12 years 0.04 mm/year and 0.05 mm/year after 16 years of loading. Document [29] states that the mean marginal bone loss during the period from prosthesis connection to the 1-year follow-up was 0.6 mm, and from the 1-year to the 3-year follow-up, average peri-implant bone loss was 0.3 mm in the graft group and 0.5 mm in the trial group. All these documents suggest that the annual bone loss seen after 1 year in a functional implant is less than 0.1 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
