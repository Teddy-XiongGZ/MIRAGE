    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An occlusal rest in a removable partial denture (RPD) provides vertical support and allows occlusal forces to be transmitted through the long axis of the abutment tooth as per Document [2]. This means it provides a vertical stop and occlusal support. Document [1] mentions that the occlusal rest of the removable partial denture fits significantly and provides stability, which implies horizontal stabilization. However, none of the documents mention that the occlusal rest provides retention. Retention in a removable partial denture is usually provided by other components such as clasps or other retentive features as per Document [6].\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
