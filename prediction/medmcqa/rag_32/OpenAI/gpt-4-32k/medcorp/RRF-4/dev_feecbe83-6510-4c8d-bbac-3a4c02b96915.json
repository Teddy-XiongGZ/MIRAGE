    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's liver function test results show elevated levels of conjugated serum bilirubin, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, while SGOT and SGPT are not significantly elevated. This pattern suggests a cholestatic process, where there is an obstruction in the bile flow. This could be due to a blockage in the bile ducts (choledocholithiasis) or a malignancy causing obstruction (malignant obstructive jaundice). Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder that causes chronic jaundice and predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but it is usually benign and does not cause significant liver damage. Viral hepatitis typically presents with elevated transaminases (SGOT and SGPT), which is not the case here. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis would be a condition causing obstruction in the bile flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Malignant obstructive jaundice\"}"
