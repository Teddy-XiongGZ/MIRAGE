    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most common cause of nose bleeding, also known as epistaxis, is trauma. This is mentioned in several documents. Document [0] mentions that risk factors for nosebleeds include trauma, such as putting the finger in the nose. Document [1] also lists trauma from nose picking, blunt trauma, or insertion of a foreign object as common causes. Document [14] and [15] also mention that nosebleeds are caused by the rupture of a blood vessel within the nasal mucosa, which can be spontaneous or initiated by trauma. Document [17] mentions that epistaxis in the pediatric population is most often due to digital trauma. Document [27] lists digital manipulation and trauma as local causes of epistaxis. The trauma usually occurs in the anterior part of the nose, specifically in Kiesselbach's plexus, also known as Little's area, as mentioned in Document [3] and Document [14]. Therefore, the most common cause of nose bleeding is trauma to Little's area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
