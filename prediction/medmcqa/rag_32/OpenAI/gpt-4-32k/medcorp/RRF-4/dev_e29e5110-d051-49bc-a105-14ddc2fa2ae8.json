    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CG islands are regions in the DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide. These regions are typically unmethylated and often found in promoters for housekeeping genes. Methylation of CG islands plays a role in gene expression regulation, which is a part of a larger field of science studying gene regulation called epigenetics. Therefore, CG islands are important for methylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
