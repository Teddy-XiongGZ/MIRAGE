    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has primary amenorrhea, which means she has never had a menstrual period. She has well-developed breasts (Tanner's stage 5), indicating normal estrogen effect, but minimal pubic hair (Tanner's stage 1), suggesting a lack of androgen effect. This combination of findings is characteristic of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a condition in which individuals are genetically male (46, XY) but are resistant to androgens. As a result, they have normal female external genitalia, develop breasts at puberty, but have minimal to no pubic or axillary hair. Internally, they have testes (which may be intra-abdominal or inguinal), but no uterus or upper vagina, leading to primary amenorrhea. Turner's syndrome and premature ovarian failure would not explain the lack of pubic hair, and M\u00fcllerian agenesis would not typically affect breast development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
