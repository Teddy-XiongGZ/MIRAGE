    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the test that is not typically performed on a pleural tap sample from a patient suspected of having tuberculosis (TB). From the documents, it is clear that ADA (adenosine deaminase) testing is commonly used in the diagnosis of TB (Document [2]). LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) is also mentioned as a common test in the evaluation of pleural effusions (Document [6]). Albumin is also typically measured in pleural fluid analysis (Document [7]). However, there is no mention of Gene Xpe being used in the diagnosis or evaluation of TB or pleural effusions in any of the documents. Therefore, Gene Xpe is likely the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
