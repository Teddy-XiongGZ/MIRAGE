    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactose intolerance is a condition where the body is unable to fully digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. This can lead to symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. From the documents, it is clear that people with lactose intolerance should avoid foods high in lactose, such as condensed milk, ice-cream, and skimmed milk. However, it is also mentioned in Document 17 that yogurt is very well tolerated by lactose intolerant persons, despite its lactose content. This is due to the presence of living lactic acid bacteria in fermented dairy products which survive passage through the stomach and also to the lactase present in these products.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Yogurt\"}"
