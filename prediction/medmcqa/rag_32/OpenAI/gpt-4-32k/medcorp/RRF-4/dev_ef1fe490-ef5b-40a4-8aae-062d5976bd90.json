    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The confidence interval is calculated using the formula: mean \u00b1 (Z*standard deviation)/sqrt(n), where Z is the Z-score, n is the sample size, and sqrt is the square root. For a 90% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.645. So, the confidence interval is 85 \u00b1 (1.645*25)/sqrt(100) = 85 \u00b1 4.1125. Therefore, the range for the 90% confidence interval is from 80.8875 to 89.1125.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
