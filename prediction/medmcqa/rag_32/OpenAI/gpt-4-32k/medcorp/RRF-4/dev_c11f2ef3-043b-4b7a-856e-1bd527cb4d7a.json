    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has pain in the bilateral preauricular region and deviation of the mandible to the right side on mouth opening. This suggests that there is an issue with the mandible or the temporomandibular joint. The preauricular region is the area in front of the ear, which is where the temporomandibular joint is located. A fracture or dislocation of the condyle, which is the rounded end of the mandible that articulates with the temporal bone to form the temporomandibular joint, could cause these symptoms. If the mandible deviates to the right when the mouth opens, this suggests that the left condyle is not moving properly, which could be due to a fracture or dislocation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a fracture or dislocation of the left condyle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fracture of left condyle\"}"
