    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most appropriate average for the given data. The data provided is a set of numbers representing the number of dental caries cases reported each year for the last 10 years. The arithmetic mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers, which is a common way to calculate the average. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set, which doesn't seem to be relevant here as we are not asked about the most frequent number of cases. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending or descending order, which is not necessarily representative of an average in this context. The geometric mean is the nth root of the product of n numbers, which is typically used when dealing with percentages or rates, not relevant in this case. Therefore, the arithmetic mean seems to be the most appropriate way to calculate the average number of caries cases reported in the town for the last 10 years.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
