    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the prognosis of a tooth with a root fracture depends on the location of the fracture. Fractures located in the apical and middle thirds of the root generally have a good prognosis and usually require little treatment apart from immediate repositioning and stabilization if the coronal fragment has been displaced. The apical pulp often remains vital. Therefore, a permanent tooth with a fracture involving the apical one-third of the root would most likely remain vital and functional after treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
