According to Document [0], approximately 70% by mass of the acellular component of bone is attributed to the inorganic phase. Document [7] also mentions that the inorganic bone matrix accounts for 99% of the body storage of calcium, 85% of the phosphorus, and 40 to 60% of the magnesium, and sodium. However, the exact percentage of the inorganic component in the overall bone composition is not mentioned in these documents. Document [15] states that bone is approximately 10% water, 30% organic, and 60% inorganic. This is the closest to the options provided in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
