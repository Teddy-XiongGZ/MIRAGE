    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Inhalational anthrax is a lethal infection caused by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis. The documents mention that the common clinical manifestations of inhalational anthrax include severe dyspnea, hypotension, and hemorrhage. The documents also mention that the radiological manifestations of inhalational anthrax are distinctive, with a widened mediastinum and pleural effusions being common findings.
