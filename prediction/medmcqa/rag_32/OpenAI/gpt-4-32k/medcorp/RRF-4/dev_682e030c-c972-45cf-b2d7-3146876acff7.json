    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the statement that is NOT true about idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Step 2: Review each statement individually and cross-reference with the provided documents. Statement A: \"It is associated with platelet-specific auto-antibodies\" - Document [4] and [6] confirm that ITP is an autoimmune disease with antibodies detectable against several platelet surface structures. Statement B: \"It causes a prolonged bleeding time\" - Document [1] and [9] suggest that ITP can cause bleeding, but they do not specifically mention prolonged bleeding time. However, it is reasonable to infer that a reduction in platelets could lead to prolonged bleeding time. Statement C: \"It is often controllable by immunosuppressive treatment\" - Document [1] and [6] confirm that ITP can be treated with immunosuppressive treatments such as glucocorticoids. Statement D: \"It causes more prolonged hemorrhage than hemophilia\" - None of the documents provided directly compare the bleeding caused by ITP to that caused by hemophilia. However, it is generally known that hemophilia is characterized by prolonged and severe bleeding. Therefore, this statement is likely to be false. Step 3: Choose the answer. Based on the information provided in the documents, the statement that is likely to be false is D. Output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each statement individually and cross-referenced them with the provided documents. Statements A, B, and C are confirmed by the documents. Statement D is not directly addressed in the documents, but based on general knowledge about hemophilia, it is likely to be false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
