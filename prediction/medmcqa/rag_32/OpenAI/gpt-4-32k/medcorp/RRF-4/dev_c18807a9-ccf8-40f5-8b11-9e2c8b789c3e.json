    "The woman has been pregnant 4 times (2 abortions, 1 current twin pregnancy, and 1 previous full-term pregnancy). This makes her Gravida 4. She has given birth once before to a child who is now 3 years old, making her Para 1. The numbers following the \"P\" represent full-term pregnancies, preterm pregnancies, abortions/miscarriages, and living children. She has had 1 full-term pregnancy (the 3-year-old child), no preterm pregnancies, 2 abortions, and 1 living child. Therefore, her representation is G4P1 1+0+2. So, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman has been pregnant 4 times (2 abortions, 1 current twin pregnancy, and 1 previous full-term pregnancy). This makes her Gravida 4.
