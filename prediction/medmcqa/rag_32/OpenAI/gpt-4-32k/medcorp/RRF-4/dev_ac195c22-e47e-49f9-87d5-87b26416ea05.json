    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has received one dose of DPT and OPV at 2 months of age. According to the routine vaccination schedule, the second dose of DPT and OPV should be given at 4 months and the third dose at 6 months. The child is now 18 months old, so they have missed these doses. However, according to the catch-up vaccination schedule, if a dose is missed, it should be given at the next visit. Therefore, the child should receive the second dose of DPT and OPV next. BCG is usually given at birth, and the child is too old for this now. The measles vaccine is usually given at 9 months, so this could also be given now. A booster dose of DPT and OPV is usually given at 15-18 months, but since the child has not completed the primary series yet, they should not receive the booster dose now.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
