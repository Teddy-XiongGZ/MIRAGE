    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that breastfeeding can result in the baby contracting HIV from the mother. Therefore, avoiding breastfeeding (Choice A) can decrease mother to child transmission of HIV. Document [12] mentions that the administration of zidovudine to the mother and child can decrease the risk of transmission, so Choice C can also decrease transmission. Document [1] mentions that deficiencies in micronutrients such as vitamin A can increase the risk of transmission, implying that supplementation (Choice D) could decrease transmission. This leaves us with Choice B, vaginal delivery. Document [9] mentions that the risk of transmission is increased with exposure to maternal blood, which is unavoidable in a vaginal delivery. Therefore, a vaginal delivery would not decrease the risk of transmission.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
