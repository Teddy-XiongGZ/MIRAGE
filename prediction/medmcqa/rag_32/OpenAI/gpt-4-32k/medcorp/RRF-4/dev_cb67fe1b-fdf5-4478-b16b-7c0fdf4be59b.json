    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Indirect retainers are components of removable partial dentures that help prevent the denture from rotating or tipping. The fulcrum line is the axis around which the denture tends to rotate. The placement of indirect retainers is crucial to their effectiveness. According to the principles of physics, the further the indirect retainer is from the fulcrum line, the more effective it will be in preventing rotation. Therefore, indirect retainers should be placed as far anteriorly from the fulcrum line as possible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
