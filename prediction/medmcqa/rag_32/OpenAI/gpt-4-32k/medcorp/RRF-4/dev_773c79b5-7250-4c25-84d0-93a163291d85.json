    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the control of the position and movement of the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). From the documents, it is clear that the lateral pterygoid muscle plays a role in the movement of the TMJ disc. Specifically, Document [28] and Document [29] mention that fibers originating from the superior venter of the lateral pterygoid muscle are inserted into the disc, suggesting that this muscle plays a role in controlling the disc's position and movement. Therefore, the upper head of the lateral pterygoid muscle is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Upper head of lateral pterygoid muscle\"}"
