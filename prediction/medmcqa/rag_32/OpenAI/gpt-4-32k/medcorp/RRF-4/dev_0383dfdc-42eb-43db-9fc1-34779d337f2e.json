    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A high-risk infant is typically defined as a newborn with potential health problems that could occur because of genetic or environmental factors, or due to complications during pregnancy or birth. Mal-presentation refers to abnormal positioning of the baby in the womb, which can lead to complications during delivery and potentially affect the health of the newborn, making it a high-risk situation. Folic acid tablet not consumed refers to the mother's nutrition during pregnancy, which can affect the development of the fetus, but it doesn't necessarily make the infant high-risk. A working mother doesn't inherently make an infant high-risk. Antenatal preeclampsia is a condition in pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the liver and kidneys. This condition can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby, making the infant high-risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
