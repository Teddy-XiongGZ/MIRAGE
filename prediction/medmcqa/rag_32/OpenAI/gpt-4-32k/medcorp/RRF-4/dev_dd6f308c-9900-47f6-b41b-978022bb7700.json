    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's ability to walk upstairs one step at a time and ride a cycle suggests that they have developed certain motor skills, which according to Document [1] and Document [2], typically happens around the age of 3 or 4. However, the child's inability to jump might suggest a slightly younger age, as Document [1] mentions that children often achieve this skill during their third year. In terms of language skills, the child's ability to speak sentences and identify their own name and gender suggests a more advanced developmental stage. According to Document [25], children typically start to use sentences of 4-5 words and have a vocabulary of about 1000 words by age 4. However, the child's difficulty in narrating a story suggests that their cognitive and language skills are not fully developed, which is more consistent with a younger age. According to Document [10], by the age of about 9 a child can recount other narratives in addition to their own experiences. Therefore, considering all these factors, the child's developmental age is likely around 3 or 4 years.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 3\"}"
