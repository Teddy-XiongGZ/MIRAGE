    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking which of the given options is not a Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Step 2: Search for each option in the provided documents to see if they are mentioned as Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Step 3: Document [2] and [10] mention bivalirudin as a Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitor, but none of the options are mentioned in these documents. Step 4: Document [6] mentions that Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors are used in primary angioplasty, but again, none of the options are mentioned in this document. Step 5: Document [26] mentions a study about the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor RPR 109891, but none of the options are mentioned in this document. Step 6: None of the documents provided mention the options as Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Therefore, I will need to use my medical knowledge to answer this question. Step 7: From my medical knowledge, I know that Abciximab, Tirofiban, and Eptifibatide are Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is an antiplatelet drug that inhibits the P2Y12 ADP receptor on platelets, not a Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Based on these steps, the answer is Prasugrel.
