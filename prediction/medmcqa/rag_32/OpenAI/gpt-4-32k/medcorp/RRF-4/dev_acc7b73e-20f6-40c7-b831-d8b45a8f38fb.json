    "The question is asking for a poor prognostic indicator of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). None of the documents provided directly mention prognostic indicators for ALL. However, we can infer from general knowledge about prognostic indicators that a high leukocyte count, not a low one, would typically indicate a poorer prognosis in leukemia. Similarly, age is often a negative prognostic factor in many diseases, with older patients typically having a worse prognosis. Hypodiploidy, or having fewer than the normal number of chromosomes, is generally associated with a poor prognosis in cancers. The sex of the patient is not typically a major prognostic factor in most cancers, including ALL. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. Hypodiploidy. { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a poor prognostic indicator of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).
