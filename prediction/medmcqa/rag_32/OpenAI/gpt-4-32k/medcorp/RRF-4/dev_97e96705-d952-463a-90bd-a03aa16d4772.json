    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the second optimal landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping and obturation in endodontic treatment. The first optimal landmark is usually the apical foramen. The apical constriction is the narrowest part of the root canal and is typically the ideal location for the apical limit of endodontic procedures. The cementodentinal junction is the interface between the cementum covering the root of the tooth and the dentin of the root, which is not typically used as a landmark for endodontic procedures. The major diameter refers to the widest part of the canal, which is not a suitable landmark for termination of these procedures. Therefore, the apical constriction is the most suitable answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
