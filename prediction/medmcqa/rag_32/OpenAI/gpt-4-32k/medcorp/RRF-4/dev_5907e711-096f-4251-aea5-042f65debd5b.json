    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention the use of low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis after surgery. The common route of administration mentioned in the documents is subcutaneous. For example, Document [0] mentions prophylactic therapy with low molecular weight heparin can reduce post-operative deaths from PE and reduce DVT without increasing the risk of serious postoperative bleeding. Document [1] mentions subcutaneous heparin for venous thromboprophylaxis. Document [2] mentions a higher dose of low-molecular-weight heparin is effective in preventing post-surgical VTE. Document [3] mentions low molecular weight heparin is effective and safe to use as prolonged thromboprophylaxis after major abdominal surgery. Therefore, the best route of administration for low molecular weight heparin for postoperative thromboprophylaxis is subcutaneous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
