    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 19 years old and has a swelling over the left angle of the mandible, a fever, and no history of trauma. Spontaneous fracture of the mandible (Choice A) is unlikely without a history of trauma. Pericoronal infection (Choice B) could cause swelling and fever, but it typically occurs around a partially erupted or impacted tooth, which is not mentioned in the question. Mumps (Choice C) is a viral infection that typically causes swelling of the parotid glands, not specifically the angle of the mandible. Sjogren's syndrome (Choice D) is an autoimmune disease that typically causes dry eyes and mouth, not swelling of the mandible. Therefore, based on the information given, pericoronal infection seems to be the most likely cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
