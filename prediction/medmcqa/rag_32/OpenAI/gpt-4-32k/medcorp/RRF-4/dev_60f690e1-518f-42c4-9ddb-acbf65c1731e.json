    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel calcification is a process that occurs during tooth development. According to Document [12], enamel formation starts immediately after the first layer of dentin is laid down by the odontoblasts. The enamel matrix is secreted at the amelodentinal junction and the mineralization process begins by secretion of calcium and phosphate ions into the enamel matrix. Therefore, the calcification in enamel starts at the enamel matrix.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
