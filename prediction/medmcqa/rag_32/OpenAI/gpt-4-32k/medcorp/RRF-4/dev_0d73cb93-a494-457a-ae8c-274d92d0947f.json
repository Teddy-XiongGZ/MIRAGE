    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the life expectancy at birth for both males and females according to the 2011 census. I need to find a document that provides this specific information. Document [19] provides the life expectancy at birth for males and females in 2011 for the population of Nepal. However, the question does not specify a country, so this may not be the correct answer. Document [9] provides the life expectancy at birth for women in Croatia in 2012, but this does not match the year or include information for males. Document [15] provides the life expectancy at birth for males and females in Estonia in 2012, but again this does not match the year. Document [28] provides the life expectancy at birth for the total U.S. population in 2012, but does not break it down by gender. None of the documents provide the specific information asked for in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
