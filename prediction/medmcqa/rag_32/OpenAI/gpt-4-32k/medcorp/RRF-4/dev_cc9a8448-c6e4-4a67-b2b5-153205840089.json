    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Obstructive jaundice is caused by a blockage in the bile duct, preventing bilirubin from reaching the intestine where it is converted to urobilinogen. As a result, the amount of urobilinogen available for reabsorption and excretion is limited, leading to low levels of urobilinogen in the urine. Therefore, in obstructive jaundice due to gallstones, urobilinogen levels would not be raised or normal, but rather low. However, the options do not include 'low' or 'reduced', so the closest answer would be 'completely absent', although this might not be entirely accurate as some urobilinogen might still be produced.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
