    "The relevant document for this question is Document [3], which discusses the time of fusion of the sternebrae with one another. According to the document, the third and fourth sternebrae showed partial or commencement of fusion in a majority of specimens in the 0-5 years age group. Although the earliest complete fusion was seen in the 6-10 years age group, 100% specimens exhibited complete fusion in the 15-17 years age group. Based on this information, the lower two parts of the sternal body would be completely fused by the age of 15-17 years. However, this range is not provided in the answer choices. The closest option to this range is 14 years. So, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document mentions that the complete fusion of the sternebrae occurs in the 15-17 years age group. However, this range is not provided in the answer choices. The closest option to this range is 14 years.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
