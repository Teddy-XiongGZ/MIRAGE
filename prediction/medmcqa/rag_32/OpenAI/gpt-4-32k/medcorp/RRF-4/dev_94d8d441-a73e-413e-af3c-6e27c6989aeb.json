    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endoderm is the innermost of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo. It forms the epithelial lining of multiple systems, including the digestive and respiratory tubes. Therefore, epithelial cells of the intestine (Choice A), goblet cells (Choice C), and hepatocytes (Choice D) are all derived from the endoderm. Odontoblasts, on the other hand, are cells in the pulp of the tooth that are responsible for the formation of dentin, a hard tissue that forms the bulk of the tooth. These cells are derived from ectoderm, not endoderm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
