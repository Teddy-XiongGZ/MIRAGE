    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 95% confidence interval in clinical trials is used to estimate the range within which the true population parameter lies with a certain degree of confidence. In the context of drug efficacy, it is used to assess both the efficacy and non-efficacy of the drug. If the confidence interval includes the null value (usually 0 or 1, depending on the measure of effect), it suggests that the drug is not significantly different from the placebo, indicating non-efficacy. If the confidence interval does not include the null value, it suggests that the drug is significantly different from the placebo, indicating efficacy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
