    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Slow waves are generated by a class of pacemaker cells called the interstitial cells of Cajal, as mentioned in Document [2]. This is also confirmed in Document [1], which states that slow waves are generated at unique intrinsic frequencies by the interstitial cells of Cajal. Therefore, the slow wave potential originates in the Interstitial cells of Cajal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
