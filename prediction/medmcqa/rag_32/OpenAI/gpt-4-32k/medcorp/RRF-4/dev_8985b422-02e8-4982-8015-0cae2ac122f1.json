    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibrinolytics are drugs that dissolve blood clots. Overdosage of fibrinolytics can lead to excessive bleeding. To manage this, agents that inhibit fibrinolysis can be used. Epsilon amino Caproic Acid and Tranexamic Acid are antifibrinolytics, so they can be used to manage overdosage of fibrinolytics. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) contains all clotting factors and can also be used to manage bleeding. DDAVP (Desmopressin) is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin and is used to treat conditions like diabetes insipidus and von Willebrand disease. It increases the release of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, but it does not have a direct role in managing fibrinolytic overdosage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
