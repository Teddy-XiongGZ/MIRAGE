    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The definition of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) is a fever of 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F) or more lasting for at least three weeks for which no cause can be identified after three days of investigation in hospital or after three or more outpatient visits. This definition does not exclude patients with immunological compromise. Therefore, the statement 'Absence of immunological compromise' is not part of the definition of PUO. However, the statement 'Fever undiagnosed after 1 week of in-patient workup' is not part of the definition either, as the definition specifies a period of three days in hospital or three outpatient visits.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
