    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gait apraxia is a disorder of motor planning often associated with cognitive impairment and is not due to motor or sensory deficits. It is characterized by an inability to initiate or continue movement, particularly in relation to walking. From the documents, it is clear that gait apraxia is often associated with lesions in the frontal lobe or the supplementary motor area (SMA).

Therefore, a thromboembolic episode involving the ACA could potentially lead to gait apraxia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
