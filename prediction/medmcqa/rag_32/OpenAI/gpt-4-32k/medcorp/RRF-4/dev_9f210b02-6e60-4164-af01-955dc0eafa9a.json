    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about the density and diameter of dentinal tubules in different layers of dentin. Step 2: Document [0] and [1] state that the diameter of dentinal tubules is greatest near the pulp and tapers from the inner to the outermost surface. This supports choice C. Step 3: Document [0] and [1] also mention that the density of the tubules is greatest near the pulp, which supports choice A. Step 4: Document [13] mentions that the tubule diameter increases as the dentin depth increases for primary and permanent teeth, which also supports choice C. Step 5: There is no information in the documents about the difficulty of bonding on different layers of dentin, so choice D cannot be confirmed or refuted. Step 6: Document [28] states that the tubular dimensions in bovine teeth are 4.21 microm at the superficial dentin and 3.14 microm at the deep dentin. Document [13] mentions that the tubule diameter is 2.4 \u03bcm at the superficial layer and 4.28 \u03bcm at the deep layer for human teeth. These measurements are all less than 5 \u03bcm, which contradicts choice B. Based on these findings, the statement that is not true about dentinal tubules is choice B. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first looked for information about the density and diameter of dentinal tubules in different layers of dentin. I found that the diameter and density are greatest near the pulp, which supports choices A and C. I didn't find any information about the difficulty of bonding on different layers of dentin, so I couldn't confirm or refute choice D. However, I found that the diameter of dentinal tubules in both bovine and human teeth is less than 5 \u03bcm, which contradicts choice B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
