    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Beveling is a technique used in cavity preparation where the edge of the cavity is angled. According to Document [1], beveling is recommended to improve the marginal quality of a composite restoration. Document [2] also supports this, stating that beveling results in higher values for 'continuous' margins compared to unbeveled controls. Document [14] also mentions that beveling does reduce marginal leakage. Therefore, the purpose of beveling the pulpoaxial line angle of a class II cavity is to improve the marginal adaptation of the restoration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
