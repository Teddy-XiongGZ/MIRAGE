    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intraoperative histopathological analysis is a technique used during surgery to examine tissues and determine the nature of a disease. It is often used to detect positive margins after resection, confirming that all of the tumor has been removed (Choice B). It can also be used to confirm suspected metastasis, or the spread of cancer from the primary site to other parts of the body (Choice C). Sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast carcinoma is an example of this technique, where the first lymph node to which cancer cells are most likely to spread from a primary tumor is removed and examined (Choice D). However, while intraoperative histopathological analysis can provide valuable information, it does not always give an immediate definitive diagnosis of a tumor (Choice A). The final diagnosis often requires further examination and testing after surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
