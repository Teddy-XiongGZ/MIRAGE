    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the percentage of accessory canals found in the apical third of the root. Document [0] mentions that a high percentage of accessory canals can be found in the apical 3 mm of the root, but it does not provide a specific percentage. Document [1] mentions that accessory canals were found in 33.33% of the cases in the apex third of the root. However, this percentage does not match any of the answer choices. Document [2] mentions that accessory canals were found in 5% of the teeth, but it does not specify if this is in the apical third of the root. Document [3] does not provide a specific percentage for the apical third of the root. Document [4] mentions that these ramifications were usually located in the apical area of the root, but it does not provide a specific percentage. Document [5] mentions that the prevalence of accessory canals was 41%, but it does not specify if this is in the apical third of the root. None of the other documents provide a specific percentage for the apical third of the root. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, it is not possible to determine the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
