    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the total body surface area (TBSA) involved in the burn, we can use the Lund and Browder Chart as mentioned in Document 0. According to this chart, for a child of 2 years, the head represents 18%, each arm represents 10%, the anterior chest and abdomen represent 13% each. Therefore, if the child has burns on the face (part of the head), both upper limbs, and the front of the chest and abdomen, we add up these percentages: 18% (head) + 10% (right arm) + 10% (left arm) + 13% (anterior chest) + 13% (abdomen) = 64%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 60%\"}"
