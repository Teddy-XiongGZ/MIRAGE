    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what 'first hand knowledge' means. According to Document [2], 'firsthand' means obtained directly from the primary source. This means that 'first hand knowledge' refers to knowledge gained directly from personal experience or observation, not from other people's accounts or opinions. Now, I will look at the answer choices. Option A, 'Opinion of a doctor in cou', is not a direct personal experience or observation, it's someone else's opinion. Option B, 'Handwriting expe', is unclear and seems incomplete. Option C, 'Common witness', refers to a person who has directly observed an event, which aligns with the definition of 'first hand knowledge'. Option D, 'Fingerprint expe', is also unclear and seems incomplete. Therefore, the best answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
