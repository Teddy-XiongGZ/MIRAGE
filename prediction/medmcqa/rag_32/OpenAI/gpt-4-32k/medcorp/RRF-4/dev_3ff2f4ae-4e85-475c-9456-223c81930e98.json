    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pattern of enamel prism demineralization, specifically which part (head or tail) is more resistant to dissolution. From the documents, Document [0] provides the most relevant information. It mentions that the direction of progress of demineralization and contour of demineralization front in the enamel are closely related to the arrangement of enamel prisms. It also suggests that carious demineralization progresses along the enamel prisms. However, it does not specify whether the head or tail of the prism is more resistant to dissolution. None of the other documents provide specific information about the resistance of the head or tail of the enamel prism to dissolution. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
