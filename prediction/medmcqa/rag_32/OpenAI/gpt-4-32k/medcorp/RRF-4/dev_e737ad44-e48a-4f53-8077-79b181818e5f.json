    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Weber-Fechner law is a principle in the field of psychophysics that describes the relationship between the physical magnitudes of stimuli and the corresponding perception of these magnitudes. According to the documents, this law states that the intensity of sensation increases as the logarithm of an increase in energy or stimulus intensity. Therefore, the Weber-Fechner law is related to the intensity of stimulus, not the number of nerve fibers, muscle fibers, or stimulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Intensity of stimulus\"}"
