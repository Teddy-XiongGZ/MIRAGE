    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The working time of zinc polycarboxylate cement is not directly mentioned in any of the documents. However, Document [0] mentions that polycarboxylate cement has a shorter working time compared to zinc phosphate cement. Document [7] discusses the working time of zinc phosphate cement but does not provide a specific duration. Document [12] mentions that the working time of zinc polycarboxylate cement can be elongated by adding tartaric acid, mixing on a cold glass slab or using a lower powder: liquid ratio, but again, no specific time is given. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it is not possible to determine the exact working time of zinc polycarboxylate cement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer this question.\"}"
