    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Loss of 40% of the circulating blood volume is a severe condition that can lead to shock. According to Document [0], shock can set in when 40% of blood volume is lost. This would likely result in a decrease in blood pressure, as stated in Document [2] and Document [10]. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer. Document [10] also mentions that urine output declines when 30% to 40% of total blood volume is lost, so option D is not the correct answer either. Central venous pressure is not directly mentioned in the documents, but it is reasonable to assume that it would decrease with such a significant loss of blood volume, so option B is not the correct answer. However, Document [2] and Document [10] both mention that heart rate significantly increases, not decreases, with a loss of 30% to 40% of total blood volume. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
