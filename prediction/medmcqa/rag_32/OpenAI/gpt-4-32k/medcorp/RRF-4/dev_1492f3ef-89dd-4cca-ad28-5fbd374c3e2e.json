    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The articular disc of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a fibrocartilaginous structure that separates the condylar process of the mandible and the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone. According to Document [6], the disc is biconcave and transversely oval, which means it is not thickest posteriorly (eliminating option A). The same document also mentions that the disc is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue, but it does not mention that it is strengthened by the lateral pterygoid muscle (eliminating option C). Document [14] mentions that the central area of the disc is thinner but of denser consistency than the peripheral region, which is thicker but has a more cushioned consistency. This suggests that the disc is narrow in the centre (supporting option B). Therefore, based on the information from the documents, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
