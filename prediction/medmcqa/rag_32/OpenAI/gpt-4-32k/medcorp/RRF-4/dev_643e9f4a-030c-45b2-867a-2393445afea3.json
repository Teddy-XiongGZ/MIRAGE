    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gentamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting the DNA gyrase enzyme, which is necessary for the replication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that works by inhibiting the bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that works by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Therefore, the drug that acts on the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria is Vancomycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
