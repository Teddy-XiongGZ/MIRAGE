    "First, I will review the documents to understand the characteristics of unstable angina. From Document [11], I see that unstable angina has at least one of these three features: it occurs at rest (or with minimal exertion), usually lasting more than 10 minutes. This information supports both options A and B. However, Document [10] states that one distinguishing factor of unstable angina is that the pain may not completely resolve with rest, which contradicts option C. Therefore, the answer should be a combination of options A and B, but not C. So, the output in json would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Unstable angina is characterized by chest pain that occurs at rest or with minimal exertion, and usually lasts more than 10 minutes. However, the pain may not completely resolve with rest, which contradicts one of the answer choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A and B\"}"
