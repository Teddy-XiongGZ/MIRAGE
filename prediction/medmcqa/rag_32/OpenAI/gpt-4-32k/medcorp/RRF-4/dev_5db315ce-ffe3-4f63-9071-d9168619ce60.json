    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best method to counteract acidosis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Acidosis is a condition in which there is too much acid in the body fluids. It is often associated with severe illnesses or physical stress. Looking at the documents, it is clear that sodium bicarbonate is often used to treat acidosis. Document [0] mentions that sodium bicarbonate is used for the correction of acidemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Document [1] also mentions that bicarbonate is recommended for use during resuscitation. Document [4] discusses the controversy around the use of sodium bicarbonate during cardiac arrest and hypoxic acidosis. However, it does not negate its use. Document [7] states that sodium bicarbonate should be administered for cardiac arrest due to metabolic acidosis. Document [14] also mentions that sodium bicarbonate improved acid-base status. Therefore, the best method to counteract acidosis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation is to administer sodium bicarbonate intravenously.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sodium bicarbonate intravenously\"}"
