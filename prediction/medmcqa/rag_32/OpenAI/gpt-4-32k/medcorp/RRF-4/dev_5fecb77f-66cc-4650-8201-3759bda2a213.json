    "First, we need to understand the concept of steady state plasma concentration. According to Document [0], clearance is equal to the rate at which a drug is removed from plasma divided by the concentration of that drug in the plasma. Therefore, we can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the drug in the plasma, which is equal to the rate at which the drug is administered divided by the clearance of the drug. In this case, the rate of administration is 1.6 mg/min and the clearance is 640 mL/min. By substituting these values into the equation, we can calculate the steady state plasma concentration of the drug. Dict{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I understand the concept of steady state plasma concentration. Then, I rearrange the equation for clearance to solve for the concentration of the drug in the plasma. Finally, I substitute the given values into the equation to calculate the steady state plasma concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
