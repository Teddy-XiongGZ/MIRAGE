    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, we know that myelinated nerve fibers conduct impulses faster than non-myelinated fibers (Document 1, Document 4, Document 5). This contradicts option A. We also know that membrane currents are generated at nodes of Ranvier (Document 5), which supports option B. Saltatory conduction, a rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation, is seen in myelinated nerve fibers (Document 1, Document 7), which supports option C. Lastly, local anesthesia is effective on all nerve fibers, not just those not covered by myelin sheath (Document 10), which contradicts option D. Therefore, the untrue statement is option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
