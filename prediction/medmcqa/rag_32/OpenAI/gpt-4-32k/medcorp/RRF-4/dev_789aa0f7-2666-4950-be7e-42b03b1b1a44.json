    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intracellular receptors are located inside the cell rather than on its cell membrane. They bind to ligands that are usually intracellular second messengers or extracellular lipophilic hormones. Glucagon, insulin, and epinephrine are all hormones that bind to cell surface receptors, not intracellular receptors. Thyroxine, on the other hand, is a thyroid hormone that is lipophilic and can cross the cell membrane to bind to intracellular receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Thyroxine\"}"
