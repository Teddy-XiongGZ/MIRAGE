    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that the calcification process of third molars begins earlier in blacks, but it does not provide a specific age. Document [1] suggests that the calcification of the third molar may be an indicator in judging the chronological age of a teenager, but it does not provide a specific starting age. Document [2] states that the tooth bud presence is between 9 and 11 years, but this is not the same as the beginning of calcification. Document [13] states that the earliest age for maxillary third molar crypt formation was eight years; mandibular third molars could be seen radiographically as early as seven years. Document [21] states that the mean age of entering third molar stages (crypt appearance to root completion) was calculated from the micro-CT images before and after cleaning with the GentleWave system. Calcifications were observed in all thirds of the canals. Document [27] states that the average age of entering initial mineralization ranged from 7.97 to 9.74 years while average age of apex closed was 19.27-20.88. Document [28] states that the use of third molars as a developmental marker is appropriate in young adults of Central China. The formula obtained in the present study can be used as a guide for estimation of dental maturity and a standard for age estimation for young adults of Central China. Based on these documents, the calcification of the third molar begins around the age of 8 years.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
