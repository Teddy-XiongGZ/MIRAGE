    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most appropriate periodontal surgical procedure in case of horizontal bone loss in the upper anterior region. Looking at the documents, Document [14] mentions that surgical pocket elimination techniques can be used when pockets remain inflamed after repeated thorough professional treatment. However, it does not specify which technique is most appropriate for horizontal bone loss. Document [24] discusses the use of periodontal flap surgery for treating chronic periodontitis, but again does not specify the best procedure for horizontal bone loss. Document [30] discusses a combination of periodontal flap surgery with vestibular deepening for treating chronic periodontitis in lower anterior teeth, but this may not be applicable to the upper anterior region. None of the documents provide a clear answer to the question. However, based on general knowledge, a coronally displaced flap is often used in cases of horizontal bone loss to cover the exposed root surface and promote regeneration of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
