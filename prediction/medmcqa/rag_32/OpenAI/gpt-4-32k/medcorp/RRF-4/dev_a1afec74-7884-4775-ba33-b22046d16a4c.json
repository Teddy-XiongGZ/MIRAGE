    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Type I diabetes mellitus is characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. This high blood sugar level leads to increased urination (polyuria) as the body tries to get rid of the excess glucose through urine.

This process leads to the production of acetyl CoA from fatty acids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased conversion of fatty acid to acetyl CoA\"}"
