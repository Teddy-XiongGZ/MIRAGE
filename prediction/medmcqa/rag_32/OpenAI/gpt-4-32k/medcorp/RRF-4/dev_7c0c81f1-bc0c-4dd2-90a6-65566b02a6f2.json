    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bisphosphonates are known to inhibit bone resorption, a process primarily carried out by osteoclasts. According to Document [0], bisphosphonates preferentially bind to calcium ions, which are abundant in bones, and are released by osteoclasts, the bone cells that break down bone tissue. Document [1] also mentions that bisphosphonates are internalized by bone-resorbing osteoclasts and inhibit osteoclast function. Therefore, it can be inferred that osteoclasts have the greatest affinity to bisphosphonates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Osteoclasts\"}"
