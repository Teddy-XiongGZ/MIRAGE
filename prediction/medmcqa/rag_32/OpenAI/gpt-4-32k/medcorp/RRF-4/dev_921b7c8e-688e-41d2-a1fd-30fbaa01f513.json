    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document [4] discusses the influence of the bucco-lingual position of upper posterior artificial teeth on pronunciation. It mentions that pronunciation disorders caused by the arrangement of the upper posterior artificial teeth in complete dentures occur when the lingual surfaces of the upper molars are located more than 1/4 inward of the distance between the right and left denture border from the buccal denture border or less than 1/10 of that distance outward from the buccal denture border. The document also mentions that the influence of the arrangement of the upper posterior artificial teeth on pronunciation depends on the vowel following the consonant of the sound. However, it does not specify which sounds are affected when the maxillary teeth are placed too far anteriorly and superiorly. Document [28] discusses the effect of different maxillary central incisor positions on phonetic patterns. It mentions that the change of incisor block angle in both directions usually causes a poorer execution of the /s/ sound. Therefore, the answer is B. S and T sounds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
