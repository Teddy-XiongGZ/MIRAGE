    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a newborn with cyanosis, oligaemic lung fields, and a normal-sized heart. Oligaemic lung fields indicate decreased blood flow to the lungs. This is a common feature in conditions where there is decreased blood flow to the lungs such as pulmonary atresia. In contrast, conditions like Transposition of great arteries and Tetralogy of Fallot usually present with increased blood flow to the lungs and hence are less likely. Ebstein's anomaly typically presents with an enlarged heart due to the malformation of the tricuspid valve, which is not the case here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pulmonary atresia\"}"
