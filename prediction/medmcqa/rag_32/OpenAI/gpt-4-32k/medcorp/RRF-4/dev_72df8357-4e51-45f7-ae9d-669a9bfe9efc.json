    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lidocaine is a class Ib antiarrhythmic agent. It works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. This is mentioned in Document [7]. It does not increase A-V conduction, increase cardiac conduction velocity, or increase spontaneous pacemaker activity. Instead, it decreases cardiac excitability by blocking sodium channels, which slows the rise of the cardiac action potential during phase 0, thereby increasing the effective threshold potential as mentioned in Document [17].\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
