    "The question describes a 3-year old child with hepatosplenomegaly and large cells with a \"crumpled paper\" appearance in the bone marrow. This description is characteristic of Gaucher's disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down glucocerebrosides. When it is deficient, glucocerebrosides accumulate in various tissues, including the bone marrow, leading to the symptoms described. Step 1: Identify the symptoms - hepatosplenomegaly and large cells with a \"crumpled paper\" appearance in the bone marrow. Step 2: Match these symptoms to a disease - these are characteristic of Gaucher's disease. Step 3: Identify the cause of Gaucher's disease - a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Step 4: Identify what accumulates as a result of this deficiency - glucocerebrosides. Therefore, the answer is B. Glucocerebrosides.
