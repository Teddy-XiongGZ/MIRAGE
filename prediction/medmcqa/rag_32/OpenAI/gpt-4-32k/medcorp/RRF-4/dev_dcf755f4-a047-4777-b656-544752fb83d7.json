    "First, I will review the documents to find information about the location of the soft tissue or scar in patellar cluck syndrome and when it impinges on the femoral component. Document [2] states that patellar clunk syndrome is characterized by a painful palpable audible clunk of the patella when the knee moves from flexion to extension. It is attributed to the formation of fibrous nodule at the junction of the proximal pole of the patella and the undersurface of the distal quadriceps tendon. Document [3] also mentions that Patellar Clunk Syndrome is a painful condition associated with a mechanical catching or clunking during active extension following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The syndrome is caused by growth of interposing soft tissue usually at the superior pole of the patella. Document [4] states that Patellar clunk syndrome is associated with popping and catching during knee extension. It is caused by nodule formation on the posterior quad tendon near its insertion on the patella. Document [26] also mentions that patellofemoral pain due to an unusual suprapatellar fibrous nodule developed in three patients after posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty. Each patient had a \"catch\" or \"clunk\" associated with pain on extension of the knee. From these documents, it is clear that the interposition of soft tissue or hyperophied scar in patellar cluck syndrome is at the superior pole of the patella and it impinges on the femoral component during extension. So, the answer is B. Superior pole of patella and impinging on femoral component during extension.
