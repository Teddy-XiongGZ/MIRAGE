    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best choice of retainer for a posterior abutment with an acceptable crown root ratio, average crown length, and normal esthetic requirement. From the documents, it is clear that the choice of retainer depends on several factors including the location of the tooth, the condition of the tooth, and the esthetic requirements.

Partial veneer crowns, resin veneers, and PFM (Porcelain Fused to Metal) are typically used for anterior teeth or teeth with specific esthetic requirements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
