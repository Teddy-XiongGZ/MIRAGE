    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case of an 8-year-old child with a fractured maxillary central incisor that happened 10 months ago. The pulp shows no response, which indicates pulp necrosis or death. There is no periapical lesion in the radiograph, which means there is no infection at the root tip. Given these conditions, the treatment of choice would be to perform a conventional root canal treatment. This is because the pulp is non-vital and needs to be removed. The other options like Ca(OH)2 pulp capping and Formocresol pulpotomy are not suitable because they are used when the pulp is still vital. Complete debridement and apexification is typically used for teeth with open apices, which is not mentioned in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
