    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a neurological scale that aims to give a reliable and objective way of recording the state of a person's consciousness for initial as well as subsequent assessment. The GCS is composed of three parameters : Best Eye Response, Best Verbal Response, Best Motor Response. From the question, the patient is opening his eyes on verbal command, which corresponds to a score of 3 on the eye-opening response scale. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which means he cannot give a verbal response, so his verbal score is 1T. The patient moves all his 4 limbs spontaneously, which corresponds to a score of 6 on the motor response scale. Adding these scores together, the patient's GCS score is 3 (eye) + 1T (verbal) + 6 (motor) = 10T.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
