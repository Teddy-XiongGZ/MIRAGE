    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about the effect of adding MgO to alginate. Document [0] mentions that changing the amount of magnesium oxide (MgO) used in the experimental formulations had a marked effect on pH. Increasing MgO concentration corresponded with increased pH values. However, this doesn't directly answer the question. Document [1] mentions that an alginate/PVA complex scaffold, blended with near-spherical MgO nanoparticles, produced a complex composite nanofibrous scaffold with enhanced mechanical stability. This suggests that adding MgO to alginate can improve its strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Improve strength.\"}"
