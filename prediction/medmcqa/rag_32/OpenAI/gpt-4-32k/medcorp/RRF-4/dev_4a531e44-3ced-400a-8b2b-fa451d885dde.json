    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the electrical conductivity speed of A \u03b1 fibres. Looking at the documents, Document [10] mentions that some myelinated neurons conduct at speeds up to 120 m/s. Since A \u03b1 fibres are a type of myelinated neuron, this information is relevant. Therefore, the answer should be the range that includes 120 m/s.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
