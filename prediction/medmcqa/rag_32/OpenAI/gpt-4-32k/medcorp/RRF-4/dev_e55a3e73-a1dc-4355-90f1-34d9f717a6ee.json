    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is on steroid therapy and has chronically infected teeth that need extraction. Steroid therapy can impair healing and alter responses to infection as per Document [0] and Document [1]. Therefore, it is important to manage the risk of infection during and after the extraction. Document [3] and Document [7] suggest that antibiotics can be used prophylactically in such cases to prevent postoperative infection. The other options (Atropine, Antihypertensive, Antihistaminics) are not relevant in this context as they are not directly related to managing infection risk in patients on steroid therapy undergoing dental extraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Antibiotics\"}"
