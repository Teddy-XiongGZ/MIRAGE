    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a hard, painless testicular swelling and elevated AFP, which are suggestive of a testicular tumor. The ultrasound shows uniform echotexture and small areas of necrosis, further supporting the suspicion of a malignancy. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) and Trucut biopsy are less invasive procedures that can be used to confirm the diagnosis, but they carry a risk of tumor seeding along the needle tract. PET-CT could provide more information about potential metastasis, but the absence of paraaortic, iliac, or mediastinal lymph nodes on initial investigation makes metastasis less likely. High inguinal orchidectomy allows for both diagnosis and treatment of the suspected testicular tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. High inguinal orchidectomy\"}"
