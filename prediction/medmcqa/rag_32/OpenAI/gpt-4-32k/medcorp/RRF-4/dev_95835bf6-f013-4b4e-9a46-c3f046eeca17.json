    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Relining procedures are used to improve the fit of dentures. These procedures involve the application of new material to the tissue side of a denture to fill the space between the original denture contour and the altered tissue contour. This can cause changes in the fit and feel of the denture, which can lead to fear and anxiety in patients. However, the fear is not specifically related to the alteration of balanced occlusion, centric occlusion, vertical dimension, or condylar guidance. Instead, it is more likely related to the overall change in the fit and feel of the denture, as well as potential discomfort during the procedure. Therefore, none of the provided options accurately answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
