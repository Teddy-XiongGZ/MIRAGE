    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of force that should be applied to cause root movement. From the documents, it is clear that the force applied should not be too heavy as it can cause root resorption or damage (Document 5, Document 11, Document 18, Document 24, Document 28). Document 28 suggests that a sliding force of 2N is ideal for ensuring bodily orthodontic tooth movement. Document 30 suggests that the 'ideal force' can vary depending on various factors such as the type of movement (bodily or tipping), the bone type (cortical or spongy), the age of the patient, the length of the root, and whether the tooth is being moved with or without friction. Therefore, the force applied should be gentle to prevent damage. Extra-oral force (Choice C) is not mentioned in the documents as a recommended method for causing root movement. Torque or moment (Choice B) is mentioned in Document 8 and Document 13, but it is not specifically recommended for causing root movement. Positive intermittent force (Choice A) is mentioned in Document 28 as a method that can reduce the amount of root resorption compared to continuous force, which suggests it could be a good method for causing root movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
