    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, one parent is homozygous for an autosomal recessive gene, meaning they have two copies of the recessive gene (aa). The other parent is heterozygous, meaning they have one copy of the dominant gene and one copy of the recessive gene (Aa). When these two mate, the possible combinations for their offspring are Aa and aa. The Aa offspring will be carriers of the disease but will not be affected due to the presence of the dominant gene. The aa offspring will be affected as they have received two copies of the recessive gene. Therefore, there is a 50% chance that a child will be affected (aa) and a 50% chance that a child will be a carrier but not affected (Aa).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 50% children affected, rest are carriers\"}"
