    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best radiograph to obtain a view of the maxillary sinus. Document [24] states that Waters' view is commonly used to get a better view of the maxillary sinuses. Document [10] also mentions that a single Waters view may be an acceptable strategy for diagnosing maxillary sinusitis.

Therefore, based on the documents, the best radiograph to obtain a view of the maxillary sinus is the Waters view.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
