    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coronal suture is a dense, fibrous connective tissue joint that separates the two parietal bones from the frontal bone of the skull. When the coronal suture fuses prematurely, it can result in skull deformities. According to Document [14], premature fusion of the coronal suture often results in a condition known as brachycephaly, which is characterized by a wide and high head.
