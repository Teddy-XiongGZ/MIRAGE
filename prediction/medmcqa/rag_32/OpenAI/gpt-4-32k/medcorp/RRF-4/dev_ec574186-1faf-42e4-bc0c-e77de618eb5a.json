    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the occurrence of malocclusion in a given population. This is a measure of how common the condition is within that population at a specific point in time. This is not about the number of new cases over a certain period of time, which would be incidence. It's also not about the risk of developing the condition, which would be probability. Morbidity refers to the state of being diseased or unhealthy within a population.
