    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity is a measure of a material's ability to deform under stress. A higher modulus indicates a stiffer material. According to Document [0], the strength of amalgam restorations varied with the type of base. Zinc phosphate cement is superior to zinc phosphate cement plus Dycal, which is equal to Dycal. Dycal is superior to Cavitec, which is the same as Cavitec plus Dycal. The amalgam restorations were stronger over a base with a higher modulus of elasticity. Document [3] also states that modulus elasticity of cement plays an important role in affecting the fracture strength of the amalgam restored tooth. The lower the elasticity modulus, the higher the stresses and deflections induced in the dentine. From the point of mechanical property, zinc phosphate is one of the best dental cements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. ZnPO4\"}"
