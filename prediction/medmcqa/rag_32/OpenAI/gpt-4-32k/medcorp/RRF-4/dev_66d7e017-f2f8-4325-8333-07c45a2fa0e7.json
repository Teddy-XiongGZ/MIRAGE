    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of fiber that carries innervation in striated muscle stretch fibers. From Document [0], we know that alpha motor neurons contribute to muscle tone and the stretch reflex in striated muscle. However, this is not one of the answer choices. Document [4] and Document [20] mention that intrafusal muscle fibers, which are part of the muscle spindle and involved in detecting stretch, are innervated by gamma motor neurons. Therefore, the correct answer should be the type of fiber associated with gamma motor neurons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Gamma fiber\"}"
