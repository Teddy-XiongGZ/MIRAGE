    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Catlan's appliance is mentioned in Document [0]. According to this document, it is used to correct anterior crossbite in children. It is a fixed appliance and is referred to as a Lower Inclined Bite Plane, which suggests that it is constructed on the lower anterior teeth with an inclined plane.
