    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inter-radicular bone is the bone found between the roots of the teeth. According to Document [1], the inter-radicular distance suggests that there is a minimal risk of radicular injury when miniscrews are inserted between the alveolar structures. This suggests that the inter-radicular bone is not compact, as it allows for the insertion of miniscrews. Document [7] states that cancellous bone was found between 89.6% of the teeth examined and was observed where inter-root distances exceeded 0.5 mm. This suggests that the inter-radicular bone is cancellous, not compact, exophytic, or osteophytic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
