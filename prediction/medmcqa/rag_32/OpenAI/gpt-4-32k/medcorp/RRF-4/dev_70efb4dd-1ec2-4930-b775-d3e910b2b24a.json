    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A flexible major connector in a removable partial denture (RPD) can lead to an unequal distribution of forces, which can change their intensity and potentially cause damage to the supporting structures. This could lead to problems with the fit of the RPD and potentially cause issues with occlusion. However, there is no direct evidence in the documents provided that a flexible major connector would cause periodontal ligament (PDL) destruction of abutment teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
