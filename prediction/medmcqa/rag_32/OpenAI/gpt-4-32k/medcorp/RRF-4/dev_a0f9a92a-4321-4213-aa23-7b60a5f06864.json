    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) is. From the documents, I can see that EBM is a method of medical practice that emphasizes the use of evidence from well-designed and well-conducted research. It involves the integration of clinical expertise with the best available research information. It also involves critical appraisal of the evidence and applying it to individual patient care. Now, let's look at the options. Option A states that EBM depends on clinical model and decision analysis to base its recommendations. This is true as EBM involves the integration of clinical expertise with the best available research information. Option B states that EBM objectively evaluates the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in publications. This is also true as EBM involves critical appraisal of the evidence. Option C states that the strongest argument for the therapeutic intervention is systemic review or meta-analysis of triple blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogenous population of patients or medical disorders. This is true as EBM classifies evidence by its epistemologic strength and requires that only the strongest types can yield strong recommendations. Option D states that the weakest argument is the opinion of experts or medical boards. This is not necessarily true. While EBM emphasizes the use of evidence from well-designed and well-conducted research, it does not completely disregard the opinion of experts or medical boards. These opinions can still be considered as part of the evidence, although they may not be as strong as evidence from well-conducted research.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
