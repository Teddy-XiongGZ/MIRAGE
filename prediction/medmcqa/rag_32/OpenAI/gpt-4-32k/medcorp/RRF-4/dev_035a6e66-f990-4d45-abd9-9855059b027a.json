    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about the organisms that cause infective endocarditis. From the documents, I can see that Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of infective endocarditis, and it's reasonable to assume that other Staphylococcus species like Staphylococcus albus could also cause the disease. Streptococcus faecalis, which is also known as Enterococcus faecalis, is mentioned as one of the common organisms responsible for infective endocarditis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not specifically mentioned in the documents, but it is a well-known pathogen that can cause a variety of infections, including endocarditis. Salmonella typhi, on the other hand, is primarily associated with typhoid fever and is not typically associated with endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Salmonella typhi.\"}"
