    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mechanism of adhesion of Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) to the tooth structure is described in Document [1]. It states that GIC chemically bonds to the tooth structure, specifically enamel and dentin. This adhesion is due to a chelation reaction between the carboxyl groups of the polyacrylic acid in GIC and the calcium in the hydroxyapatite crystals of the tooth. Therefore, the carboxyl group plays a crucial role in the adhesion of GIC to the tooth surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Carboxyl group\"}"
