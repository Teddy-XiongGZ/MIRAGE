    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a fractured central incisor with the fracture line extending 4 mm gingival below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). This means that the fracture is subgingival and involves both the crown and root of the tooth. The buccal bone is thin, which could complicate treatment options that involve surgical intervention. The apicopalatal bone is thick, which could provide good support for an implant. Document [25] describes a similar case where a tooth with a subgingival fracture was treated with endodontic treatment and orthodontic extrusion, but this might not be suitable for this patient due to the extent of the fracture and the thin buccal bone. Document [1] discusses the use of single-tooth implantation for a root-fractured maxillary incisor, which could be a suitable option for this patient. The implant would provide a stable replacement for the fractured tooth and the thick apicopalatal bone would provide good support. Therefore, extraction and implant seems to be the most suitable treatment option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
