    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the incidence of two canals in mandibular incisors. Looking at the documents, Document [1] states that the prevalence of the second canal in incisors is 36.62%. Document [2] states that the overall prevalence of more than 1 root canal in mandibular central and mandibular lateral respectively was 40.5% and 37.9%. Document [15] states that the prevalence of second canals was as follows: right central incisor - 33.5%, left central incisor - 30%, right lateral incisors - 33.5% and left lateral incisor - 36.5%. Document [29] states that double root canals were found in (right 26.1% and left 26.4%) mandibular central incisors, in lateral incisors (right 28% and left 30.4%). All these documents suggest that the incidence of two canals in mandibular incisors is between 20% and 41%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
