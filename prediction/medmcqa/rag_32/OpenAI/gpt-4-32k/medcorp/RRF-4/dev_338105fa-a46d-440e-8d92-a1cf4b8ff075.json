    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is suffering from dehydration due to diarrhea. This means they have lost a significant amount of fluids and electrolytes. The goal of treatment is to replace these losses. According to Document [6], the intravenous solution to be used in severe diarrhea cases is 5:4:1 (5g of sodium chloride, 4g of sodium bicarbonate and 1g of potassium chloride per liter) or a comparable commercial alkaline solution. This suggests that a saline solution, which contains sodium chloride, would be appropriate. Document [3] also mentions the use of simple and readily available solutions to prepare the electrolyte mixtures for intravenous rehydration. Therefore, 0.9% saline, which is a common intravenous solution used in medical settings, seems to be the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
