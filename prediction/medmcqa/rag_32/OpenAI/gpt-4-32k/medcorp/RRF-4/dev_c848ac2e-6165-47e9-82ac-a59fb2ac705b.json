    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient complains of numbness of the lower lip. According to the documents, this symptom can be caused by several factors. Document [0] and [14] mention that dental manipulation, especially implant surgery or tooth extraction, can cause damage to the mandibular canal and inferior alveolar nerve, leading to neurosensory disturbances such as lower lip numbness. However, the question specifies that there is no history of tooth extraction, so this option can be ruled out. Document [1], [2], [17], [20], [27] and [29] suggest that lower lip numbness can be a symptom of metastatic neoplasia or malignant disease. Document [5] and [25] mention that infection, such as a peri-radicular abscess or postoperative pulpitis, can also cause lower lip numbness. Document [7] and [30] suggest that general anesthesia or CNS disease can cause lower lip numbness, but these are rare cases. Given the information provided in the question, the most likely causes are infection or metastatic neoplasia. Since the question does not provide any information about other symptoms or the patient's overall health status, it is difficult to determine the exact cause. However, considering the severity and potential risk, metastatic neoplasia should be considered.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metastatic neoplasia.\"}"
