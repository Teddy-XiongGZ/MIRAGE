    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The specific plaque hypothesis posits that certain specific bacteria or microorganisms are responsible for the pathogenicity of plaque, as stated in Document [0]. This means that not all plaque is pathogenic, but only those containing specific microorganisms.

Also, the hypothesis does not state that plaque is pathogenic only when signs of associated disease are present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
