    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a patient who has difficulty swallowing after receiving a pair of complete dentures. Document [12] mentions that removing dentures in elderly edentulous individuals influences bolus transport during feeding, resulting in the exacerbation of the reduced swallowing reserve capacity that accompanies ageing, and may increase the risk of dysphagia. Document [14] also mentions that denture wearing can bring some masticatory function back to normal but cannot fully compensate for the efficiency of the natural dentition because dentures are not fixed in place like teeth are and so have to be actively controlled by the muscles. This suggests that the difficulty in swallowing could be due to the adjustment to the new dentures and the need for the muscles to actively control them. Therefore, the most likely reason for the difficulty in swallowing is not due to an excessive vertical dimension of occlusion, interocclusal distance of more than normal, alveolar ridge with bony spicules, or Candida albicans colonizing the mouth causing patient discomfort.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
