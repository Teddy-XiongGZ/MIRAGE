    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has undergone surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with high-grade necrosis and has clear margins of 4mm. DCIS is a non-invasive or pre-invasive breast cancer, meaning it hasn't spread out of the milk duct into any normal surrounding breast tissue. DCIS isn't life-threatening, but having DCIS can increase the risk of developing an invasive breast cancer later on. According to Document [0], the risk of chest wall recurrence in patients with DCIS and close or positive mastectomy margins is low and does not warrant a recommendation for postmastectomy radiation therapy for patients with margins of <5 mm. Document [2] also suggests that breast conservation can be achieved with excellent local control by obtaining microscopically negative margins and postoperative radiation that includes boost therapy to the tumor bed. However, in this case, the patient has already achieved negative margins through surgery. Therefore, no additional treatment may be necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. No additional treatment\"}"
