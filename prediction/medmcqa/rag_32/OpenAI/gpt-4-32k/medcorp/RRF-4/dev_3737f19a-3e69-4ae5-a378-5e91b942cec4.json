    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms described in the question, including abdominal cramps, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, are indicative of foodborne illness. The timing of the symptoms, appearing 6-10 hours after the party, is also a key factor in determining the likely cause. Rotavirus and Enterotoxigenic E.coli infections typically have a longer incubation period, usually more than 24 hours. Clostridium perfringens infection can cause similar symptoms, but the incubation period is typically 8-12 hours, which is slightly longer than the timeframe given in the question. Staphylococcal toxin, on the other hand, can cause symptoms within a few hours of ingestion, which aligns with the 6-10 hour timeframe given in the question. Therefore, the most likely cause of the outbreak is Staphylococcal toxin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
