    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cleaning method for base metal alloys. From the documents, it is clear that different alloys may require different cleaning methods. However, none of the documents mention the use of warm HCl, cold HF, or cold H2SO4 specifically for cleaning base metal alloys. On the other hand, Document 0 mentions the use of air abrasion, which is a method similar to sandblasting, for cleaning a NiCr alloy. Therefore, it seems that sandblasting with aluminium oxide could be a plausible method for cleaning base metal alloys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
