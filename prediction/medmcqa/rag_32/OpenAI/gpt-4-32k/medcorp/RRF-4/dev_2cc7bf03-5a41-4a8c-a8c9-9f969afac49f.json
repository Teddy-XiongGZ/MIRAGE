    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the different types of study designs mentioned in the options. A cross-sectional study is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population, or a representative subset, at a specific point in time. A case-control study is a type of observational study in which two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. A randomized controlled trial is a type of scientific experiment which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. A cohort study is a particular form of longitudinal study that samples a cohort, performing a cross-section at intervals through time. Now, to assess the strength of association between smoking and lung cancer in quick time, a case-control study would be the best choice. This is because it allows researchers to compare those with the disease (lung cancer patients who smoke) to those without the disease (people who don't smoke), and it can be done relatively quickly and inexpensively compared to other study designs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
