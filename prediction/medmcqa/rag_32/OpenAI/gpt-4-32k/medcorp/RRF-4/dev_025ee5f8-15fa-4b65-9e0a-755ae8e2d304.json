    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A molecule with a permanent dipole moment is a polar molecule. This occurs when there is a significant electronegativity difference between the atoms in the molecule, causing a shift of electron density towards the more electronegative atom and creating a dipole. Oxygen (O2), helium (He), and nitrogen (N2) are all diatomic molecules composed of two identical atoms, so there is no electronegativity difference and hence no permanent dipole. Water (H2O), on the other hand, is a polar molecule because there is a significant electronegativity difference between the oxygen atom and the hydrogen atoms, creating a permanent dipole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
