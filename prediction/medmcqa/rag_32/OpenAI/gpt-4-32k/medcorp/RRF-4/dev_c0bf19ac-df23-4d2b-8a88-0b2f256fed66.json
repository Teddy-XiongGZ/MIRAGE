    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Granulation tissue is a part of the healing process after a wound or injury. It is composed of new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels. According to Document [21], the extracellular matrix of granulation tissue is created and modified by fibroblasts. Initially, it consists of a network of type-III collagen, a weaker form of the structural protein that can be produced rapidly. This is later replaced by the stronger, long-stranded type-I collagen, as evidenced in scar tissue. Since the boy's wound is only 4 days old, it is still in the early stages of healing, and thus the granulation tissue would primarily consist of type-III collagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
