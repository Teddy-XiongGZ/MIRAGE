    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rh isoimmunisation is a condition that occurs when a person with Rh-negative blood is exposed to Rh-positive blood, leading to the production of antibodies against the Rh antigen. This can occur during pregnancy if the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive. The documents provided do not mention any specific type of hemoglobin (Hb) being affected by Rh isoimmunisation. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, and it is not directly related to the Rh blood group system. The options provided (Anti C, Anti E, Anti lewis, Anti D) are not types of hemoglobin, but rather, they are types of antibodies that can be produced in response to different antigens in the blood. Therefore, none of these options are types of hemoglobin that could be affected by Rh isoimmunisation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
