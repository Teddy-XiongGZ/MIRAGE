    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and acute cervical lymphadenopathy are indicative of an infection, possibly streptococcal pharyngitis or infectious mononucleosis. These conditions can be initially evaluated through a complete hemogram, which can reveal signs of infection such as elevated white blood cell count. An open biopsy of the node or a radical neck dissection would be invasive procedures and are not typically the first step in investigating these symptoms.

Therefore, a complete hemogram would be the most likely initial investigation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
