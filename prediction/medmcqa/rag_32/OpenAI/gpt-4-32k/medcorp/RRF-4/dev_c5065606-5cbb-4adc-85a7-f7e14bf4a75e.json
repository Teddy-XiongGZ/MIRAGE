    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the process of cell membrane repair after it has been damaged by a micro needle. From the documents, it is clear that the repair of a cell membrane is not a passive process, but rather an active one. Document [4] mentions that in nucleated animal cells, the cytoplasm plays an active and essential role in resealing. A rapid and apparently chaotic membrane fusion response is initiated locally in the cytoplasm by the Ca(2+) that floods in through a disruption. Document [2] also talks about a resealing process at the single cellular level as a model of molecular level wound healing. Document [18] mentions that the peak of the increase after axotomy is probably partly attributable to hypertrophic astrocytes, and partly to the surfaces of neuronal processes. Increase of membrane movements might explain such enzyme activity. Therefore, the repair process is likely to be an active process involving the hydrolysis of ATP, which provides the energy for many cellular processes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
