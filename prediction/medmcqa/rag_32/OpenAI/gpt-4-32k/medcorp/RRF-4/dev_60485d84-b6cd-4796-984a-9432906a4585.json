    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The NPCDCS program is mentioned in several documents. Document [0] provides a detailed overview of the program, stating that it was launched in 2010 to curb the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases. It does not mention anything about the program being implemented in 10 districts across 5 states, so option A is likely incorrect. Document [2] mentions that the program provides non-communicable disease care through primary healthcare teams, but it does not specify that the diagnosis or treatment is carried out at the subcentre level, so option B is likely incorrect. Document [18] mentions that the program focuses on improving the quality of prevention programs within primary and basic health sites and integrates concerted primary and secondary prevention programs into health services. However, it does not mention anything about establishing a coronary care unit and cancer care facility at the district level hospital, so option C is likely incorrect. Document [26] mentions that the program addresses non-communicable diseases directly or indirectly, but it does not specify that all the components of the program are addressed separately, so option D is likely incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above options are correct based on the provided documents.\"}"
