    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrocephalus is a condition that involves the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to increased pressure and potential enlargement of the head. The documents mention several methods for detecting hydrocephalus, but the question specifically asks for the best antenatal detection method. An X-ray of the abdomen (Choice A) would not be useful in this case as it does not provide information about the brain. Amniocentesis (Choice B) is a procedure that involves extracting a small amount of amniotic fluid from the womb during pregnancy for testing, but it is not specifically mentioned as a method for detecting hydrocephalus. Clinical examination (Choice C) could potentially detect signs of hydrocephalus, but it may not be the most effective method for antenatal detection. Ultrasonography (Choice D), on the other hand, is mentioned in several documents as a method for detecting hydrocephalus antenatally. For example, Document 15 mentions that 'sophisticated two-dimensional ultrasound techniques allow the diagnosis of prenatal hydrocephalus to be made with accuracy and ease.' Therefore, ultrasonography seems to be the best method for antenatal detection of hydrocephalus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
