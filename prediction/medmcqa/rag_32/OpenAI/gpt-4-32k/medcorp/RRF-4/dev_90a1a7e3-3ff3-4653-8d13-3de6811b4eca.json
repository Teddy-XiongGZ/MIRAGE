    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given table shows the effects of a new drug compared to a placebo. The heart rate has increased from 72 to 86, which suggests that the drug has a stimulatory effect on the heart. This is a characteristic of beta-1 agonists. The systolic blood pressure has also increased from 110 to 150, which indicates that the drug causes vasoconstriction. This is a characteristic of alpha-1 agonists. The diastolic blood pressure has decreased slightly, but this could be due to the increased heart rate and systolic pressure. The presence of tremors is also a common side effect of beta-1 and alpha-1 agonists. Therefore, the new drug is likely to be an alpha-1 and beta-1 agonist.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
