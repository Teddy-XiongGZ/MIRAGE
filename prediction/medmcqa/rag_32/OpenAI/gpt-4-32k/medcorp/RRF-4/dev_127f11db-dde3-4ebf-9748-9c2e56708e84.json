    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that contribute to the glossy smooth margins of a casting. Document [10] mentions that after electron beam irradiation, the cast titanium surface became smooth and the glossiness increased. Document [25] also mentions that the use of corn-shaped balloons resulted in better thrombolysis rates than glossy balloons. However, none of these documents directly answer the question. Document [31] mentions possible faults at casting, but none of them directly relate to the creation of glossy smooth margins. Therefore, none of the documents provide a direct answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
