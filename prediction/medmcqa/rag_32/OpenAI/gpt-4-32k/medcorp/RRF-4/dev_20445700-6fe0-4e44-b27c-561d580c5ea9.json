    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The bicarbonate buffer system, consisting of a mixture of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and a bicarbonate (HCO3-) salt in solution, is the most abundant buffer in the extracellular fluid. This buffer system can easily and rapidly change its acid-to-base ratio, as mentioned in Document [31]. This means that its components can be increased or decreased in the body as needed, which is a crucial feature for maintaining the body's pH balance. Therefore, the best answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
