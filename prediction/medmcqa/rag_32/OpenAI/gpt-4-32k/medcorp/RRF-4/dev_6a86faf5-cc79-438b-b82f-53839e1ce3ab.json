    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The role of barrier membranes in Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) is mentioned in several documents. Document [4] states that a barrier membrane is used in oral and periodontal surgery to prevent epithelium, which regenerates relatively quickly, from growing into an area where another, more slowly growing tissue type, such as bone, is desired. This method of preventing epithelial migration into a specific area is known as guided tissue regeneration (GTR). Document [2] also mentions that a barrier membrane is utilized in GTR technique to cover the bone defect and create a secluded space, which prevents the connective tissue from growing into the space and facilitates the growth priority of bone tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
