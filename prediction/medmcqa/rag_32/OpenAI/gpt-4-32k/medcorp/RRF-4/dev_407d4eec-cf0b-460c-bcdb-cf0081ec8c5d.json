    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Methacholine is a non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist, which means it can act on multiple types of muscarinic receptors. According to Document [0], methacholine acts directly on airway smooth muscle receptors to induce bronchoconstriction. Document [1] also mentions that methacholine is a non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist in the parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, methacholine can act on M1, M2, M3, and potentially M4 receptors. However, the question asks for a single receptor, so we need to find more specific information. Document [27] mentions that methacholine induces an M3 receptor-dependent decrease in bronchial smooth muscle contractility. This suggests that methacholine has a significant effect on M3 receptors. Therefore, while methacholine can act on multiple muscarinic receptors, its action on M3 receptors seems to be particularly significant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. M3\"}"
