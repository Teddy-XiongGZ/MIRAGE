    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information about the penetration of sealers into dentinal tubules. Document [0] mentions that there was no significant correlation between sealability sealer penetration into dentinal tubules. Document [1] states that the type of instrument used to activate bioceramic sealer did not affect penetrability. Document [2] compares the dentinal tubule penetration of two different sealers, indicating that the type of sealer used can influence penetration. Document [9] suggests that the thickness of the sealer cement is dependent on the obturation technique employed, while the penetration of the sealer into the dentinal tubules is independent of the obturation technique. Document [13] states that the penetration of sealer into dentinal tubules was not significantly affected by obturation technique. Document [14] suggests that the pre-mixed silicate-based sealer exhibited better penetration than the powder/liquid one. Document [15] mentions that remnants of silicone oil have a negative impact on the penetration depth of the tested sealers. Document [20] states that the bond strength and sealer penetration of resin-and glass ionomer-based sealers used with coated core was not superior to resin-based sealer used with conventional GP. Document [24] states that AH Plus showed the most optimal tubular penetration and adaptation to the root canal wall of the sealers tested. Document [25] states that EndoREZ showed significantly lower push-out bond strength than the others. Document [26] states that the penetration depth of RealSeal into the root dentinal tubules is significantly greater than that of Tubliseal. Document [27] states that AH Plus showed the best tubular adaptation and penetration. Document [28] states that the application of the Nd:YAG laser after instrumentation did not improve the depth of sealer penetration into the dentinal tubules. Document [29] states that AH Plus showed the most optimal tubular penetration and adaptation to the root canal wall of the sealers tested. Document [30] states that the application of the Nd:YAG laser after instrumentation did not improve the depth of sealer penetration into the dentinal tubules. Document [31] states that maximum penetration depth was demonstrated by AH Plus in the coronal and apical thirds, MTA-Fillapex in the middle thirds, while minimum penetration depth was seen in ZOE in the coronal and middle thirds and Sealapex in the apical thirds. From these documents, it can be concluded that the type of sealer used has a significant impact on the penetration into dentinal tubules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
