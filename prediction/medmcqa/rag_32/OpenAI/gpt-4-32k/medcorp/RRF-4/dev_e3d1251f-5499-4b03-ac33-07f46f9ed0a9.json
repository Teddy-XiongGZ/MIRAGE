    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that an extra root in the mandibular first molar can be either a radix entomolaris or a radix paramolaris. The difference between the two lies in their location. A radix entomolaris is located distolingually, while a radix paramolaris is located mesiobuccally.
