    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Gleason score is mentioned in several documents, such as Document [0] and Document [17], as a grading system for prostate cancer, which indicates that histopathology is determined by the Gleason score. Therefore, option A seems to be correct. However, let's check the other options. Document [3] and Document [16] mention that prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, but they do not specify the most common region involved, so option B cannot be confirmed. Document [3] and Document [16] also do not mention the most common type of prostate cancer, so option C cannot be confirmed. Document [27] mentions that bicalutamide, a hormone therapy, is used to treat prostate cancer, which indicates that prostate cancer is hormone-dependent, so option D is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
