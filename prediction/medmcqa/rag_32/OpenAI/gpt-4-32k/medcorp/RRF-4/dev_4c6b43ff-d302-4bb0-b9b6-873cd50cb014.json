    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heat loss from the body occurs through several physiological mechanisms. According to Document [1], these mechanisms include evaporation (which involves sweating), conduction, convection, and radiation. Vasodilation, as mentioned in Document [7], is a mechanism that facilitates heat transfer from the body core to the environment, thus contributing to heat loss. Peripheral vasoconstriction, on the other hand, is a mechanism that reduces blood flow to the skin and extremities, which would actually conserve heat rather than promote heat loss. Posture is not mentioned in any of the documents as a physiological method of heat loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Posture\"}"
