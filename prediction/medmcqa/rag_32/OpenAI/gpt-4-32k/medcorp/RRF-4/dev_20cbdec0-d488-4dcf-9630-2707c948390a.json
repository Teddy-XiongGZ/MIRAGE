    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The volume of distribution (Vd) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that represents a drug's propensity to either remain in the plasma or redistribute to other tissue compartments. A drug with a low Vd has a propensity to remain in the plasma, meaning a lower dose of a drug is required to achieve a given plasma concentration. This means that the drug does not accumulate in tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Does not accumulates in tissues\"}"
