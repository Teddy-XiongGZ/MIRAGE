    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The oxygen carrying capacity of blood is determined by the amount of hemoglobin present. According to Document [1], hemoglobin carries 98% of the oxygen in the blood in the protein-bound form, approximately 197 ml/L. The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is empirically determined to be 1.34 mL O2 / g Hbg as per Document [5]. Therefore, to calculate the oxygen carrying capacity for a patient with a hemoglobin level of 14 g/dL, we multiply 14 g/dL by 1.34 mL O2 / g Hbg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 28\"}"
