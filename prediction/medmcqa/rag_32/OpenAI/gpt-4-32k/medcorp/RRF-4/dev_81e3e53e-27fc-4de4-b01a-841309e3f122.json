    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Guiding planes on abutment teeth are used in the design of removable partial dentures. According to Document [0], the retention of acrylic resin RPDs can be substantially increased by making their guiding surfaces intimately contact the guide planes of the teeth. This suggests that guiding planes provide increased resistance towards horizontal movement. Document [1] also supports this, stating that the CAD-CAM template assisted procedure can significantly improve tooth preparation of the guiding planes. Document [19] also mentions that guiding planes provide resistance to displacement. Therefore, the answer is B. Increased resistance towards horizontal movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
