    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) is a common complication associated with blood transfusion. According to the documents, FNHTR is caused by the release of cytokines from white blood cells in the transfused product. Therefore, any process that reduces the presence of white blood cells in the blood product could potentially reduce the chances of FNHTR. Leucocyte reduction is a process that specifically targets the removal of white blood cells from blood products. Therefore, it seems to be the most relevant process to reduce the chances of FNHTR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
