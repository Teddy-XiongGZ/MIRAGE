    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been taking antitubercular therapy (ATT) regularly for Tubercular meningitis, but there is a noted deterioration in sensorium. This could be due to a number of reasons, including a paradoxical reaction to the drugs, progression of the disease, or development of a new complication. An MRI or NCCT would be useful to check for any new neurological complications or progression of the disease. A CSF examination would be useful to check for any changes in the cerebrospinal fluid that could indicate a worsening of the meningitis or development of a new infection. Liver function tests, while important in monitoring the overall health of the patient and potential side effects of the drugs, are not typically associated with changes in sensorium and would not be considered an emergency investigation in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
