    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the marker that appears last in a myocardial infarction (MI). From the documents, it is clear that the markers most widely used in detection of MI are MB subtype of the enzyme creatine kinase and cardiac troponins T and I. The cardiac troponins T and I are released within 4\u20136 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks. LDH was used until the 1980s to assess cardiac injury. Therefore, the marker that appears last in MI is either Troponin T or Troponin I.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Troponin T\"}"
