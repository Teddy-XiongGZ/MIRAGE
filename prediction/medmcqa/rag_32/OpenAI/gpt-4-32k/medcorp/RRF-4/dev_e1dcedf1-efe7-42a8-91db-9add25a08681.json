    "The question asks for the option that is not a skin disease. Step 1: Look for information on Erythema multiforme. Step 2: Look for information on Keratosis folticularis. Step 3: Look for information on Erythema migrans. Step 4: Look for information on Psoriasis form lesion. After reviewing the documents, none of them provide specific information about these diseases. However, as a medical expert, I know that Erythema multiforme, Keratosis folticularis, and Psoriasis are all skin conditions. Erythema migrans is a rash often seen in the early stage of Lyme disease, which is not primarily a skin disease but a systemic infectious disease. Therefore, the answer is Erythema migrans.
