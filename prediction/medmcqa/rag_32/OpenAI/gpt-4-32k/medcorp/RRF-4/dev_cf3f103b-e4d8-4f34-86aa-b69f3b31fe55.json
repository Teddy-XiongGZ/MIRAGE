    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the probable cause of high LDL levels in a patient with normal LDL receptor levels. LDL receptors are responsible for the uptake of LDL from the bloodstream. If these receptors are functioning normally, then the high LDL levels could be due to an issue with the LDL particles themselves. Apo B-100 is a protein that is a part of LDL particles and is necessary for the interaction between LDL and its receptor. A mutation in Apo B-100 could potentially disrupt this interaction, leading to decreased uptake of LDL and thus higher levels in the bloodstream. This is supported by information in Document [2] and Document [6].\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Apo B-100 mutation\"}"
