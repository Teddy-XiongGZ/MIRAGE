    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sharpest cusp in teeth. From the documents, Document [4] mentions that the sharpest cusp is seen in the maxillary first molars. However, this is not one of the options given in the question. Therefore, we need to look for more information. Document [6] describes the cusps of premolars, but it does not mention anything about the sharpness of the cusps. None of the other documents provide information about the sharpness of the cusps in canines or premolars. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
