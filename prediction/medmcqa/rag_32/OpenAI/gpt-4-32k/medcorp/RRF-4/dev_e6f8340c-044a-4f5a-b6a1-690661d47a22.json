    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide a direct answer to the question. However, by understanding the function of working cusps, we can infer the most suitable answer. Working cusps are the parts of the teeth that do the actual work of breaking down food during mastication, or chewing. Therefore, they guide the process of chewing, support the process by providing the necessary force, and hold the food in place. They do not necessarily balance anything, so the term 'balancing cusps' seems less relevant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Guiding cusps.\"}"
