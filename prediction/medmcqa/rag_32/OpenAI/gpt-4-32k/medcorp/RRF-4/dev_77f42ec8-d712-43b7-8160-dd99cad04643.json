    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The treatment for an intruded permanent maxillary central incisor in a child can depend on several factors, including the severity of the intrusion, the stage of root development, and the presence of any other injuries or complications. According to Document [29], the best treatment for intruded incisors in children aged 6-12 is to allow the tooth to re-erupt on its own. This is also supported by Document [1], which mentions that in some cases, watchful waiting for spontaneous re-eruption is the treatment of choice. Document [2] also mentions that orthodontic treatment can be used to reposition the teeth, but this seems to be more applicable in cases of severe intrusion. Therefore, based on the information provided, allowing the tooth to erupt on its own seems to be the most suitable treatment option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Allow tooth to erupt on its own (spontaneous eruption)\"}"
