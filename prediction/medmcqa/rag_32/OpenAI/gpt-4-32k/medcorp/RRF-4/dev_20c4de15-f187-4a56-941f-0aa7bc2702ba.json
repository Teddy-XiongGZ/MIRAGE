    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of progressive jaundice, pruritus, and clay-colored stools are indicative of a biliary obstruction. The CT scan showing dilated main pancreatic duct and common bile duct further supports this. Given the patient's age and history of chronic smoking, a malignant cause is more likely. Carcinoma head of pancreas and periampullary carcinoma are both possibilities as they can cause biliary obstruction. Chronic pancreatitis can also cause these symptoms, but it usually presents with abdominal pain, which is not mentioned in the case. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma typically presents with painless jaundice, pruritus, and clay-colored stools, but it usually causes dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, not the main pancreatic duct. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is carcinoma head of pancreas or periampullary carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
