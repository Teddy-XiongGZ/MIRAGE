    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sclerotic dentin is a type of dentin that forms as a response to stimuli such as caries, wear, and fractures. It is characterized by changes in diameter and tubular content leading to various degrees of obstruction of the lumen. This is due to the neo-apposition of peri-tubular dentin associated with intra-tubular deposition of crystals of Whitelockite. This process leads to an increase in the mineral component of the dentin, making it more resistant to caries. Additionally, sclerotic dentin is not more sensitive or hypersensitive, but rather, it is less sensitive due to the occlusion of the dentinal tubules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Insensitive, D. Resistant to caries\"}"
