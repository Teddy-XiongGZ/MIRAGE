    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The combination of Metoprolol and Verapamil can lead to profound effects on AV nodal conduction, heart rate, or cardiac contractility. This is because both Metoprolol and Verapamil have negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects, meaning they can slow down the heart rate and conduction velocity. This can potentially lead to bradycardia and AV block.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
