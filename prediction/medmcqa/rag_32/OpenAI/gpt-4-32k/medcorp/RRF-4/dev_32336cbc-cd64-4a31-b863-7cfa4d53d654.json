    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the location of a single accessory canal in the coronal third of mandibular molars. Document [18] mentions that the presence of bifid apex in the mesial root of mandibular first molars might be a predictive factor for a complex canal anatomy at the apical third with an increasing number of accessory canals. Document [26] also mentions a high prevalence of three-rooted mandibular first molars and C-shaped roots/canals in mandibular second molars from a Burmese population. Conical roots tend to have simple canal systems, whilst flatter/broader roots have more complex canal systems. This suggests that the accessory canal is more likely to arise in the mesial root.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
