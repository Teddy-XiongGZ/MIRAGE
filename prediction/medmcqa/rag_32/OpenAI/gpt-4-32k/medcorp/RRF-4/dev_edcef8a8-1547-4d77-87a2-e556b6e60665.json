    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Medial squint, also known as esotropia, is a condition where the eye turns inward. This is typically caused by an imbalance in the muscles that move the eye, specifically the muscles controlled by the cranial nerves. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) controls most of the eye's movements, including constriction of the pupil and maintaining an open eyelid. The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) controls the movement of the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for moving the eye outward. Therefore, if the abducens nerve is paralyzed, the eye would turn inward, causing a medial squint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Abducens nerve\"}"
