    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document 1 and 14 mention that pregnancy induces a multitude of anatomic, physiological, biochemical, and psychological changes. These changes begin early in the first trimester and are brought on by the increased circulating levels of progesterone and estrogen. Document 14 also mentions that many of these changes are more pronounced in multiparous patients. However, none of the documents provide specific information about stroke volume, cardiac output, intravascular volume, or peripheral resistance during pregnancy. Therefore, I need to rely on my medical knowledge. During pregnancy, stroke volume, cardiac output, and intravascular volume typically increase to meet the increased metabolic demands of the mother and fetus. However, peripheral resistance usually decreases due to hormonal changes that cause vasodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
