    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The odontoblastic layer is mentioned in several documents. Document [0] states that odontoblasts are aligned in a single layer at the periphery of the dental pulp. Document [2] also mentions that the odontoblasts are aligned in the periphery of the pulp. Document [3] mentions that odontoblasts form an epithelial layer over the inner surface of the dentin, which is in contact with the pulp. Document [8] states that odontoblasts are tall columnar cells located at the periphery of the dental pulp. Document [11] mentions that the odontoblastic layer is the outermost layer which contains odontoblasts and lies next to the predentin and mature dentin. All these documents suggest that the odontoblastic layer is a single layer outlining the pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
