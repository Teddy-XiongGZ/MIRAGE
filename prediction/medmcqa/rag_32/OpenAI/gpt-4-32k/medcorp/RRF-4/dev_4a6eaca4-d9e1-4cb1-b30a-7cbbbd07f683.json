    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pulpal floor is the bottom surface of a cavity preparation. In a class 2 inlay preparation, the pulpal floor is typically prepared to a certain depth to accommodate the inlay restoration. In an amalgam class 2 preparation, the pulpal floor is also prepared to a certain depth to accommodate the amalgam restoration. According to Document [0], the same tooth preparation design was performed on vital and nonvital teeth for ceramic inlay/onlay restorations. In nonvital teeth the pulp chambers were covered by a glass ionomer cement until the pulpal floor depths were between 2 and 2.5 mm, more likely similar to the vital teeth preparations. In vital teeth, glass ionomer was used as a liner to achieve pulpal floor depths between 2 and 2.5 mm when needed. This suggests that the pulpal floor depth for inlay and amalgam preparations can be similar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Same as Amalgam\"}"
