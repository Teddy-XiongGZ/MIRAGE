    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cell membrane is a biological structure that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment. According to the documents, the cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, made up of two layers of phospholipids with cholesterols (a lipid component) interspersed between them. The membrane also contains membrane proteins, including integral proteins that span the membrane and serve as membrane transporters, and peripheral proteins that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane. Therefore, the cell membrane consists of both lipids and proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
