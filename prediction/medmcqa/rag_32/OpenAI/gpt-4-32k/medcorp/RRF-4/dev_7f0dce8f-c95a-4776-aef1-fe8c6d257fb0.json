    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The palatine process is a part of the development of the palate. According to Document [24], the secondary palate, which includes the palatine process, begins to develop during the 6th week of development. The palatal shelves, which are part of the palatine process, grow vertically on both sides of the tongue. During the seventh week, as the jaw elongates and the tongue descends, the palatal shelves acquire a horizontal position. The shelves then fuse at the midline to form the secondary palate and fuse anteriorly to the primary palate and nasal septum. Fusion of the palate is completed by the tenth week and fully forms by the twelfth week of embryonic development. Therefore, the palatine process begins to fuse at the 6th week of fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
