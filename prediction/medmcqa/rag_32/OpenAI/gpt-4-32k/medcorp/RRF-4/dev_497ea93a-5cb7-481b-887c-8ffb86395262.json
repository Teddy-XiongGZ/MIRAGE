    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cementum and bone are both involved in the process of resorption, but they respond differently. According to Document [0], cementum is responsible for minor repair of any resorption by continued deposition to keep the attachment apparatus intact. Document [14] also mentions that cementum is capable of repairing itself to a limited degree, but not regenerate, and is not resorbed under normal conditions. On the other hand, Document [26] explains that bone is resorbed by osteoclasts, and is deposited by osteoblasts in a process called ossification. This suggests that bone undergoes a more active process of resorption and regeneration compared to cementum. Therefore, it can be inferred that resorption of cementum occurs less readily than bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
