    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lacrimation is the process of tear production. The lacrimal gland, which is responsible for tear production, is innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The parasympathetic innervation comes from the lacrimal nucleus of the facial nerve, as mentioned in Document 11. The lacrimal nerve, a branch of the ophthalmic nerve (V1), which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), provides sensory innervation to the lacrimal gland, as mentioned in Document 9. Therefore, damage to the trigeminal nerve could potentially affect lacrimation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Trigeminal nerve\"}"
