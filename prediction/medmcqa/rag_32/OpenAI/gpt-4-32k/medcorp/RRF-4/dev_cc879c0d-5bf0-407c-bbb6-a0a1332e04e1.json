    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High velocity gunshot injuries are typically associated with more severe damage due to the higher energy transfer. These injuries often result in comminuted fractures and significant soft tissue damage. According to the documents, the initial treatment for high-velocity gunshot injuries often involves debridement to remove contaminated and nonviable tissue. This is followed by stabilization of the fracture, which could involve the use of reconstruction plates. The use of grafting is also mentioned in the context of these injuries, but it is often performed in a secondary procedure after initial stabilization and debridement. Therefore, the best treatment approach for a high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation and a comminuted fracture would involve initial debridement, followed by the use of load bearing reconstruction plates, and grafting in a secondary procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
