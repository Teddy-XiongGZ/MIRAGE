    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The calcification stage of tooth development is when the tooth hardens and mineralizes. Document [28] mentions that hard tissue resorption or developmental disorders can lead to deviations in the length and shape of tooth roots. Document [30] also mentions that there are numerous structural defects that occur in primate teeth due to variable calcification during certain growth stages. These interruptions are usually areas of hypomineralization in enamel and dentin. Among the options, interglobular dentin is mentioned in Document [30] as a region that fails to calcify, which indicates a disturbance during the calcification stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
