    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"T-lymphocytes, also known as T cells, are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. According to Document [0], T cells are the predominant class of lymphocytes found in the skin and moderate many of the initial immune responses, such as allergic contact and delayed-type hypersensitivity. They are also involved in the generation, maintenance, and specificity of the skin immune response. Document [1] further explains that T cells are involved in specific primary immune responses, tumor surveillance, immune regulation, and wound healing. Document [2] states that T-cell function is dependent on the type of T cell, with major T cells including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and T regulatory cells. Document [3] adds that T cells play a central role in the adaptive immune response and can be distinguished from other lymphocytes by the presence of a T-cell receptor (TCR) on their cell surface. Therefore, the primary role of T-lymphocytes is not the production of antibodies (which is mainly the role of B cells), nor the activation of the complement system. They are also not primarily involved in immediate hypersensitivity. Instead, their primary role is the production of lymphokines and delayed hypersensitivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
