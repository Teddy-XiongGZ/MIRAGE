    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cephalic index is a measure of the width of the head divided by its maximum length, multiplied by 100. The cephalic index is used to categorize humans and animals into different groups based on the shape of their head. According to Document [0], humans can be categorized as dolichocephalic (long-headed), mesaticephalic (moderate-headed), or brachycephalic (short-headed) based on their cephalic index. However, the document does not provide specific ranges for these categories. Document [17] provides a more detailed explanation, stating that a dolichocephalic skull has a length greater than its width, a mesaticephalic skull has an intermediate length and width, and a brachycephalic skull is relatively broad and short. However, it still does not provide specific cephalic index ranges for these categories. Therefore, I need to find a document that provides specific cephalic index ranges for these categories. Document [15] provides the information I need. According to this document, a cephalic index of 70-74.9% indicates a dolichocephalic head shape.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
