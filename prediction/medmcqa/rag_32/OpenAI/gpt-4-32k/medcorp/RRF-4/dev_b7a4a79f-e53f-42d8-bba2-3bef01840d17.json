    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Juvenile periodontitis is a type of periodontal disease that occurs in children and young adults. According to the documents, it is associated with the bacterium Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and is characterized by rapid periodontal destruction. The documents also mention that there is a notable exception in immune functions in juvenile periodontitis patients, which is a depressed neutrophil chemotaxis. Neutrophil chemotaxis is the movement of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) towards a site of infection or inflammation. Therefore, a defect in neutrophil chemotaxis could contribute to the development of juvenile periodontitis. The documents do not provide definitive evidence that juvenile periodontitis is a genetic disease or an immunological defect. There is also no mention of a neutrophil adhesion defect in relation to juvenile periodontitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
