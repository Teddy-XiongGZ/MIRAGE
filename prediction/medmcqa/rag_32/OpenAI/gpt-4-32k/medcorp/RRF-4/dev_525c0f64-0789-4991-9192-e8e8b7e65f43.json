    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [7] states that an ideal primary dentition is the indicator of future ideal permanent dentition. Absence of primate or secondary spaces in the primary dentition is expression of disproportion between jaw/tooth sizes. Document [13] also mentions that the study population has fewer deviations from normal occlusion which indicates decreased tendency for malocclusion in permanent dentition. Therefore, good contacts in primary teeth with lack of spacing predicts normal occlusion in permanent teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
