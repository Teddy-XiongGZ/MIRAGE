    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a component of the immune system that is associated with the gut. According to Document [0], GALT includes the multi-follicular Peyer's patches of the ileum, the vermiform appendix, and the numerous isolated lymphoid follicles (ILF) which are distributed along the length of the intestine. Document [1] also mentions that GALT is a component of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) which works in the immune system to protect the body from invasion in the gut. Document [2] further explains that GALT can be divided into two categories considering the structure, from which the function arise. There can be found 1.) organised GALT made up from follicles \u2013 such as Peyer\u00b4s patches, mesenteric lymph nodes and even more organised appendix. Its main function is to induce immune reaction. 2.) diffuse GALT with single T and B cells, macrophages, eosinophiles, basophiles and mast cells, preferentially found in lamina propria. This part of GALT is made up from mature effector cells ready to perform their actions. From these documents, it is clear that GALT is primarily located in the lamina propria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
