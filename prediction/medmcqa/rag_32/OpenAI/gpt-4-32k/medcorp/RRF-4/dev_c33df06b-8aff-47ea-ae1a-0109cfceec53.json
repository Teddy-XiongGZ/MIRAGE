    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the true statement regarding the nerve supply of the adrenal gland. Step 2: Review the answer choices. Choice A talks about the origin of preganglionic fibers, Choice B and C talk about the absence of nerve supply in adrenal cortex and medulla respectively, and Choice D talks about the effect of nerve supply on the release of catecholamines. Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that the adrenal medulla receives a sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent and an afferent innervation. Document [5] states that the adrenal medulla is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord. Document [20] also mentions that the adrenal medulla secretes hormones in response to stimulation by sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Step 4: Compare the information from the documents with the answer choices. Based on the information from the documents, Choice A seems to be correct as it aligns with the information that the adrenal medulla is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord. Choices B and C are incorrect as both the adrenal cortex and medulla have nerve supply. Choice D is also incorrect as the release of hormones from the adrenal medulla is stimulated by the nerve supply. Step 5: Choose the correct answer. The correct answer is Choice A.
