    "The question asks which of the given options does not affect a baby in utero during pregnancy. Looking at the documents, there is no mention of Candida, Syphilis, Toxoplasmosis, or Polio affecting a baby in utero. However, from general medical knowledge, it is known that Candida, Syphilis, and Toxoplasmosis can affect a baby in utero. Candida can cause thrush in newborns, Syphilis can be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy leading to congenital syphilis, and Toxoplasmosis can cause congenital toxoplasmosis if a woman becomes infected for the first time during pregnancy. Polio, on the other hand, is not known to affect a baby in utero. Polio is a viral disease that affects nerves and can lead to partial or full paralysis, but it is not typically transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy. Therefore, the answer is Polio. The JSON output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given options does not affect a baby in utero during pregnancy.
