    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The occipitoposterior position of the fetal head during labor can be influenced by several factors. Maternal obesity and multiparity are not directly linked to this position. An android pelvis could potentially influence the position of the fetal head, but it is not the most common cause. Deflexion of the fetal head, however, is directly related to the position of the fetal head. Document [26] states that 'The OP position may be a useful predicator for labor dystocia that can lead to poor neonatal outcomes.' This suggests that deflexion of the fetal head is a common cause of the occipitoposterior position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
