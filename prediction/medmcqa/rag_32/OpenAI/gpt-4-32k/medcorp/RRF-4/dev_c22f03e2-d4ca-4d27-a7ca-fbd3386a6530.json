    "First, I will look for information in the documents that mentions the percentage of mercury (hg) in modern precapsulated dental amalgam. Document [17] states that \"Low-copper amalgam commonly consists of mercury (50%), silver (~22\u201332%), tin (~14%), zinc (~8%) and other trace metals.\" This indicates that the mercury content in modern dental amalgam is around 50%. So, the answer is A. 50-55% hg by wt. The JSON output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I found the information about the percentage of mercury in modern dental amalgam in Document [17]. It states that the mercury content is around 50%, which matches with option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
