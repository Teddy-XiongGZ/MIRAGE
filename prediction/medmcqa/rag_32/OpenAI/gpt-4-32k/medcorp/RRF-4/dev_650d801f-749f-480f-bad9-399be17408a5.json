    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi apparatus is an organelle involved in the processing and packaging of proteins in the cell. In serous acinar cells, which are a type of exocrine gland cell, the Golgi apparatus plays a crucial role in the secretion of proteins. According to Document [1], serous cells have a pyramidal shape, with a relatively wide basal surface facing the basal lamina and a small apical surface facing the lumen of the acinus. They contain large amounts of rER, free ribosomes, and a prominent Golgi apparatus. Document [20] also mentions that a well-developed Golgi apparatus is present in the apical cytoplasm of acinar cells. Therefore, the Golgi apparatus in serous acinar cells is located at the apical part of the cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
