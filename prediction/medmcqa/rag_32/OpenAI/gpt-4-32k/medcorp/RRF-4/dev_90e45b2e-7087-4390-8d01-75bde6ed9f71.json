    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that the treatment of diastema due to a thick labial frenum is typically done after a procedure called frenectomy, which involves the removal of the frenum. This is supported by multiple documents, including Document [1], which recommends surgical therapy of the frenum after the complete eruption of permanent teeth, and Document [14], which suggests that superior labial frenectomy should be delayed until permanent lateral incisors have erupted. Document [15] also supports this, stating that closure of the maxillary midline diastema with a prominent frenum is more predictable with frenectomy and concomitant orthodontic treatment than with frenectomy alone. Therefore, the answer is 'After frenectomy'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
