    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the method used for selecting patients considering potential factors that might affect the results. This implies that the selection process should account for certain characteristics or factors in the population. Simple random sampling and systematic random sampling do not account for such factors, they select individuals randomly without considering any characteristics. Cluster sampling also does not specifically account for certain characteristics, it involves selecting groups or clusters of individuals. On the other hand, stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups or 'strata' based on certain characteristics, and then selecting individuals from each stratum. This method ensures that the sample represents different subgroups in the population, and is therefore the most suitable method when considering potential factors that might affect the results.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
