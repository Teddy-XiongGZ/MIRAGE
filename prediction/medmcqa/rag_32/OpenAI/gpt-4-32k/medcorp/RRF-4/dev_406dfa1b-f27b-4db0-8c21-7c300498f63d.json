    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several prognostic factors in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Pulmonary hypertension is mentioned as a significant factor affecting the outcome in CDH in multiple documents (e.g., Document 1, Document 8, Document 11, Document 19, Document 24, Document 26). The size of the defect is also mentioned as a significant factor affecting the outcome in CDH in multiple documents (e.g., Document 14, Document 18, Document 24, Document 28). Delay in emergent surgery is mentioned as a factor affecting the outcome in CDH in some documents (e.g., Document 7, Document 21, Document 30), but the impact seems to be less clear, with some studies suggesting a delay may improve outcomes (e.g., Document 21). The gestational age at diagnosis is mentioned as a factor affecting the outcome in CDH in some documents (e.g., Document 2, Document 6, Document 16, Document 23, Document 29), but its impact on the outcome seems to be less clear and less consistently reported compared to the other factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
