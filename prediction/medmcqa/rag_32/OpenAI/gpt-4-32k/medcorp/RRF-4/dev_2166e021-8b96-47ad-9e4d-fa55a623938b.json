    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tuberculin test is used to diagnose tuberculosis. However, its interpretation can be influenced by various factors. According to Document [22], the test may be falsely positive in those who have been previously vaccinated with BCG or have been infected by other types of mycobacteria. This suggests that a high percentage of immunized people could lead to a high failure in the interpretation of the test. Additionally, Document [23] mentions that the test may be falsely negative in those who are immunocompromised, such as HIV patients. However, the question does not ask about situations where the test may fail, but rather where there is a high failure in the interpretation of the test. Therefore, the answer is not B. Document [19] also mentions that the small predictive value of tuberculin testing in a low-risk population makes it an ineffective means for screening. However, this does not directly relate to the interpretation of the test. Finally, Document [26] mentions that in areas with a high prevalence of atypical mycobacteria in the environment, positive reactions may also be due to cross-reactivity. This suggests that environmental mycobacterium infections could lead to a high failure in the interpretation of the test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
