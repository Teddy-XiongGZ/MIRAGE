    "Step 1: Review the question and the answer choices. The question is asking for a true statement about carbamazepine. Step 2: Review the documents for information about each answer choice. A. Not associated with agranulocytosis - Document [12] mentions that carbamazepine can cause transient leukopenia and, less commonly, neutropenia. Agranulocytosis is a severe form of neutropenia, so this statement is likely false. B. Has been known to cause Steven-Johnson's syndrome - Document [26] mentions that carbamazepine can cause T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity, which can lead to serious manifestations like Steven-Johnson's syndrome. This statement is likely true. C. Causes serious nephrogenic toxicity - None of the documents mention nephrogenic toxicity as a side effect of carbamazepine. This statement is likely false. D. Drug monitoring is not required - Document [27] mentions that carbamazepine levels should be monitored, especially in cases of suspected therapeutic failure. This statement is likely false. Step 3: Choose the answer that is supported by the documents. The only statement that is supported by the documents is B. Has been known to cause Steven-Johnson's syndrome. The final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each answer choice and looked for supporting information in the documents. Only one statement, 'Has been known to cause Steven-Johnson's syndrome', was supported by the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
