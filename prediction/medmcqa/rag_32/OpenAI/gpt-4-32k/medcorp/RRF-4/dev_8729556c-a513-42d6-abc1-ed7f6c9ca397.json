    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of excessive blinking and grunting, which he cannot control, suggest a tic disorder. Tic disorders are often treated with antipsychotic medications, which help to control the involuntary movements. Risperidone is an antipsychotic medication, making it a likely choice. Imipramine is an antidepressant, which may not directly address the patient's symptoms.
