    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tissue engineering involves the use of cells, scaffolds, and bioreactive molecules to restore, maintain, and improve tissue function. It often involves the use of cells like fibroblasts, and therapies like bilayered cell therapy. Acellular dermal matrix, which is a type of scaffold, is also used in tissue engineering. However, enamel matrix derivative is specifically used in dental procedures to aid in the regeneration of periodontal tissue and is not a general component of tissue engineering.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Enamel matrix derivative\"}"
