    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A carrier of Hepatitis B is a person who has the virus in their blood but does not show symptoms of the disease. There are different types of carriers. An inactive carrier is someone who has the virus in their blood but the virus is not reproducing. A healthy carrier is someone who has the virus and can transmit it to others but does not show symptoms. A convalescent carrier is someone who is recovering from the disease but still has the virus in their blood. A paradoxical carrier is not a recognized term in medical literature. Given the dentist had Hepatitis B infection 3 months back and his laboratory tests are normal now, but he is not allowed to do surgical practice, it suggests that he might still have the virus in his blood and could potentially transmit it to others. Therefore, he is most likely a convalescent carrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
