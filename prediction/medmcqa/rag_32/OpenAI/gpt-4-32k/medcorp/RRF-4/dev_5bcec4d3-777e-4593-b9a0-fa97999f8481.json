    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the proportion of false positive results in two populations. False positives occur when the test incorrectly indicates the presence of a disease. The specificity of a test is its ability to correctly identify those without the disease. If the specificity of the test is lower, it means the test is more likely to give a false positive result. Therefore, if the proportion of false positives is lower in population A, it means the specificity of the test is higher in population A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. The specificity of test is higher in population A\"}"
