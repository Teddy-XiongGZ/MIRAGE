    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the condition that is least likely to cause lytic lesions in the upper femur of a 10-year-old child. Plasmacytoma, a type of cancer that develops in plasma cells, can cause lytic bone lesions, but it is extremely rare in children. Browns tumour, a type of bone lesion that occurs in severe hyperparathyroidism, can also cause lytic bone lesions, but it is also rare in children. Metastasis, or the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another, can cause lytic bone lesions, but primary cancers that metastasize to the bone are also rare in children. Histiocytosis, a group of diseases that involve an over-production of white blood cells known as histiocytes, can cause lytic bone lesions and is more common in children than the other conditions. Therefore, the condition that is least likely to cause lytic lesions in the upper femur of a 10-year-old child is metastasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
