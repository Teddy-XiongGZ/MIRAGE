    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The radiograph is not provided, but based on the documents, it seems that the C-shaped root morphology is most common in Mongoloid populations. Document [0] mentions that C-shaped root canal systems are often found in the mandibular second molars of ethnic Chinese, which are part of the Mongoloid population. Document [9] also mentions that C-shaped canals in mandibular second molars are found most frequently in the Chinese population, which is also part of the Mongoloid population.
