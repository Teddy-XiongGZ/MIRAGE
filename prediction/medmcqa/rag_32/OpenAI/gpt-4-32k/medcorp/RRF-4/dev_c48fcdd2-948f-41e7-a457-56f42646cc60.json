    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The floor of the mouth and the suprahyoid muscles are supplied by different arteries. According to Document [0], the main arterial blood supply to the floor of the mouth is the submental artery, which is a branch of the facial artery. On the other hand, Document [2] states that the suprahyoid muscles receive their vascular supply from the branches of the external carotid artery, specifically the facial artery (submental branch) and the inferior alveolar artery (mylohyoid branch). Therefore, the facial artery is the common artery that supplies both the floor of the mouth and the suprahyoid muscles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Facial artery\"}"
