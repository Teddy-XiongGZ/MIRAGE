    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the effect of a thinner mix on gypsum products. A thinner mix would mean a higher water to powder ratio. According to Document 11, thick mixtures with low water to powder ratios had more crystals impinging upon each other during crystal growth, resulting in more expansion and more heat released. This suggests that a thinner mix, with a higher water to powder ratio, would result in less crystal impingement and therefore less expansion. So, a thinner mix would lead to decreased setting expansion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decreased setting expansion\"}"
