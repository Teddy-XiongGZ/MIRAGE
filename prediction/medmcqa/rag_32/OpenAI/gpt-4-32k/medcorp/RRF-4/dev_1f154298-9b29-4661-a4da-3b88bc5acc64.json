    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Odd-chain fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation in a similar manner to even-chain fatty acids. However, when the chain is reduced to a three-carbon molecule, propionyl CoA, it is further metabolized. According to Document [4], the final spiral of beta-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids yields one molecule of acetyl CoA and one molecule of propionyl CoA. Document [6] also states that the final product of \u03b2-oxidation of an odd-numbered fatty acid is propionyl-CoA, which is then converted into succinyl-CoA. Therefore, the \u03b2-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids produces all three: Acetyl CoA, Propionyl CoA, and Succinyl CoA. Malonyl CoA is not mentioned in the context of odd-chain fatty acid oxidation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A, B, C\"}"
