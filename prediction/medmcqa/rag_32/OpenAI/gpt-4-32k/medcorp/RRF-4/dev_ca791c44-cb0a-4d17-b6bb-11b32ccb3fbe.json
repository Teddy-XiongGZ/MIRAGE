    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Compression osteosynthesis is a surgical procedure used to fixate and stabilize fractures. It is not typically used for malunion or non-union, which are complications that can occur after a fracture has been treated. Similarly, it is not used to reduce or increase the length of a bone. Instead, it is used to stabilize fractures and promote healing. Therefore, the initial use of compression osteosynthesis was not for treating malunion, non-union, reducing or increasing the length of a bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
