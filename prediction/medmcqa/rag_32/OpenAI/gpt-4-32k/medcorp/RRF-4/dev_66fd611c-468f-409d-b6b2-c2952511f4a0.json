    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The shape of the 1st maxillary molar is not explicitly mentioned in the documents. However, from the descriptions given, it can be inferred that the shape is not square or rounded triangular. The document [0] describes the occlusal surface of the maxillary first molar as consisting of four cusps: mesiobuccal, distolingual, mesiolingual, and distobuccal. This description suggests a shape that is more complex than a simple square or rounded triangle. The document [1] also mentions variability in the morphology of the maxillary first molar, further suggesting a more complex shape. Given these descriptions, the shape of the 1st maxillary molar is most likely to be either rhomboid or trapezoid. However, a trapezoid typically has one pair of parallel sides, which is not mentioned in the descriptions. Therefore, the shape of the 1st maxillary molar is most likely rhomboid, which is a parallelogram with oblique angles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
