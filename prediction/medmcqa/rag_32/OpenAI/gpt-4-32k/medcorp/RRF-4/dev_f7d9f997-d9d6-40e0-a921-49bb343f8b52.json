    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most suitable surgery for a mandibular setback of more than 10 mm. Document 14 mentions that postoperative relapse after mandibular setback surgery might be more related to the degree of the intraoperative clockwise movement of the proximal segment, rather than the amount of setback movement. When the amount of mandibular setback is considerable, postoperative relapse might be minimized with adequate control of the intraoperative positioning of the proximal segments. Document 27 also mentions that mandibular position stabilizes 12 months after surgery performed with a surgery-first approach. It is necessary to consider mandibular forward movement from the increase in posterior vertical dimension in surgical occlusion during the treatment planning stage. Moreover, clinicians should maintain the surgical position of proximal segments during postsurgical orthodontic treatment at least until 12 months after surgery. Both these documents suggest that the type of surgery might not be as important as the surgical technique and postoperative management. However, none of the documents provide a direct comparison of the four surgical options provided in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the documents\"}"
