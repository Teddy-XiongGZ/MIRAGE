According to Document [0], RPGN involves severe injury to the kidneys' glomeruli, with many of the glomeruli containing characteristic glomerular crescents. Document [2] also mentions that RPGN is characterized by glomerular crescents in at least 50-75% of the glomeruli. Document [10] also mentions that RPGN is characterized by cellular crescent formation in the glomeruli. Therefore, the most consistent feature of RPGN is crescent formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
