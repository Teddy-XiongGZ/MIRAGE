    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reverse bevel incision is a surgical technique mentioned in Document [1]. According to the document, this incision is made using a scalpel and is guided by pre-operative planning. It is based on the amount of tooth structure to be exposed. The beveling incision also should follow a scalloped outline, to ensure maximal interproximal coverage of the alveolar bone when the flap subsequently is repositioned. This suggests that the reverse bevel incision is made to provide access to the alveolar crest (Choice C). The document does not mention that this incision is used to remove infected tissue in the sulcus (Choice B) or to allow atraumatic reflection of the gingival margin (Choice A). Therefore, the answer is not 'All of the above' (Choice D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
