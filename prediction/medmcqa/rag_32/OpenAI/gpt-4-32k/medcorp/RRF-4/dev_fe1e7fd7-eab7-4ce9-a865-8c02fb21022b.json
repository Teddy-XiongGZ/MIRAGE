    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide any information that suggests pulpectomy and pulp capping are more successful in primary teeth due to increased odontoblastic activity, increased blood supply through the wide apex, or increased volume of pulp. However, Document [0] mentions that vital primary pulp tissue is capable of healing without resorting to complete pulpectomy, which could be due to the increased blood supply through the wide apex. Document [23] also mentions that direct pulp capping should be clinically included as a successful technique for the treatment of irreversible pulpitis, which could be due to the increased odontoblastic activity in the young. However, none of the documents provide a clear answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
