    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand that first-order kinetics means the rate of metabolism/elimination is directly proportional to the plasma concentration of the drug. The half-life of a drug is the time required for a drug's plasma concentration to reach half of its initial value. In this case, the drug is eliminated by 75 mg in 90 minutes, which means the half-life of the drug is 90 minutes. After 1 half-life (90 minutes), 50% of the drug will be eliminated, leaving 100 mg. After 2 half-lives (180 minutes), another 50% will be eliminated, leaving 50 mg. After 3 half-lives (270 minutes), another 50% will be eliminated, leaving 25 mg. After 4 half-lives (360 minutes or 6 hours), another 50% will be eliminated, leaving 12.5 mg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
