    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with severe breathlessness, diaphoresis, and wheezing, which are symptoms of a severe asthma attack. Her respiratory rate is high at 30 per minute, and her blood pressure is low, indicating that she is not getting enough oxygen. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low pH, indicating acidosis, and a low pO2, indicating hypoxemia, both of which are signs of respiratory failure. The high pCO2 indicates hypercapnia, which means there is too much carbon dioxide in her blood, another sign of respiratory failure. Given these findings, the patient is in respiratory failure due to a severe asthma attack and needs immediate intervention to improve her oxygenation and ventilation. Mechanical ventilation with controlled ventilation is the most appropriate choice as it can provide the necessary support to her breathing while her underlying condition is being treated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
