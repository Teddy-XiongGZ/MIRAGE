    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provide information about the effects of lithium use during pregnancy. Document [1] mentions that infants exposed to lithium have a higher ratio of cardiovascular anomalies. Document [2] also mentions an increased risk of cardiac malformations associated with lithium use during pregnancy. Document [3] mentions an increased risk of major malformations, but the difference for major cardiac malformations was not significant. Document [4] mentions higher odds of any congenital anomaly and of cardiac anomalies with lithium exposure during pregnancy. Document [21] mentions that lithium exposure during the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations. Document [30] mentions that lithium is a teratogen, causing birth defects in a small number of newborn babies, and that case reports and several retrospective studies have demonstrated possible increases in the rate of a congenital heart defect known as Ebstein's anomaly, if taken during a woman's pregnancy. Based on these documents, it seems that the use of lithium during pregnancy increases the risk of cardiac defects in the baby.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cardiac defects\"}"
