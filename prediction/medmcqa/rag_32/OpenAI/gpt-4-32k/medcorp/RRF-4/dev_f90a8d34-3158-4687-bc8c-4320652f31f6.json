In the context of direct gold filling, cohesion would refer to the ability of the gold particles to stick together to form a solid filling. This is not related to wedging, which is a method of applying force to separate or secure objects. Annealing is a heat treatment process that alters the physical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness, making it easier to work with. Adaptability refers to the ability to adjust to new conditions, which is not relevant in this context. Atomic attraction refers to the forces that cause atoms to bond together, which is the closest definition to cohesion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Atomic attraction\"}"
