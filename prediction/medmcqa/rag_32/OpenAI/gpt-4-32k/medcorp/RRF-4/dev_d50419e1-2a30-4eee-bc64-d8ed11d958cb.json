    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's recurrent chest infections and borderline sweat chloride test results suggest the possibility of cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the sweat chloride test results are not definitively diagnostic of CF, as they fall within an intermediate range. Document [23] suggests that sweat conductivity test can be as reliable as sweat chloride test for CF diagnosis, but it is not mentioned in the options. Document [1] and [7] suggest that in cases of suspicion of CF, despite normal or borderline sweat chloride levels, genotyping and electrophysiologic measurements must be performed. Among the options, DNA analysis of delta F 508 mutation (option D) is a genotyping test that can help confirm the diagnosis of CF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
