    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is a condition where a fetus is smaller than expected for the number of weeks of pregnancy. Various parameters can be used to evaluate IUGR using ultrasound. Document [1] mentions that either estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference (alone) are accurate predictors of IUGR. Document [2] also mentions that sonographic estimated fetal weight seems to be the best parameter for diagnosing IUGR. Document [5] indicates that reduced abdominal circumference was the best single parameter in discriminating between IUGR and non-IUGR fetuses. Therefore, the best parameter for ultrasound evaluation of IUGR is abdominal circumference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
