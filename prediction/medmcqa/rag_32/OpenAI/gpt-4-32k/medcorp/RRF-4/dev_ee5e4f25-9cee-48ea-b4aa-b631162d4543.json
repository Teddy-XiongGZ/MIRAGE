    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the cause of infertility in Kartagener syndrome. Document [1] mentions Kartagener's syndrome and states that there was a severe disturbance of maturation of spermiogenesis observed in two patients. Spermiogenesis is the process where spermatids are transformed into mature spermatozoa. If this process is disturbed, it could lead to problems with the sperm's ability to fertilize an egg. However, the document does not specify the exact nature of this disturbance. Looking at the answer choices, none of them directly mention a disturbance in spermiogenesis. However, oligospermia, which refers to a low sperm count, could potentially be a result of a disturbance in spermiogenesis. Therefore, I would choose this as the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
