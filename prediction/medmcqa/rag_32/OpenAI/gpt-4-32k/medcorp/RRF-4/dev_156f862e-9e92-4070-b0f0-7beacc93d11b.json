    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The loading dose of a drug is the initial higher dose given at the beginning of a course of treatment to quickly achieve therapeutic drug concentrations. According to the documents, the loading dose is calculated using the volume of distribution, the desired peak concentration of the drug, bioavailability, and the fraction of the drug salt form which is active. However, the major determinant of the loading dose is the volume of distribution, as it is the proportionality factor that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Volume of distribution\"}"
