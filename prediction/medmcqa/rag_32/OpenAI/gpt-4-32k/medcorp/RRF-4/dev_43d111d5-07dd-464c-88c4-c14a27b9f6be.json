    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Flux in soldering is used to prevent the formation of oxides and facilitate the wetting by molten metal. Fluoride flux is a type of flux. According to Document [24], fluxes for aluminium often contain fluorides. Aluminium and its alloys are difficult to solder due to the formation of the passivation layer of aluminium oxide. The flux has to be able to disrupt this layer and facilitate wetting by solder. Therefore, fluoride flux in soldering process is used to prevent the formation of aluminium oxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
