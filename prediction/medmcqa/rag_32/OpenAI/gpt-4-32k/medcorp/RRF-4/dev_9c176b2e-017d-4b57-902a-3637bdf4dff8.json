    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Efferent arteriole constriction has several effects on the kidney's function. According to Document [29], when the efferent arterioles constrict, the pressure in the glomerular capillaries is maintained, which would not decrease the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), so option A is incorrect. Document [12] and Document [24] also support this, stating that efferent arteriolar constriction elevates the pressure in the glomerular capillaries, which increases GFR. Therefore, option A is the correct answer because it is not an effect of efferent arteriole constriction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
