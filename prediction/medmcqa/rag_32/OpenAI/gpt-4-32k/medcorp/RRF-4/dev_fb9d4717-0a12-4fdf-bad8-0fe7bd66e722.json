    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why a rest on the lingual surface of a canine is preferred over a rest on the incisal surface. Document [1] mentions that rest seats prepared in the cingula of incisor and canine teeth offer denture support. Document [3] mentions that lingual rest seats are preferred since they are more acceptable esthetically and located closer to the centre of rotation of the tooth. Document [11] mentions that canines are best suited to accept horizontal forces due to their long roots and good crown/root ratio. Document [25] mentions that the average dimensions of canine exposure to the lip were within 1 mm for both men and women in all age groups. Document [31] mentions that 30% of the preparations were overextended into dentinal tissue, and 85% had depths that were insufficient to receive rests. Based on these documents, it seems that the lingual surface of a canine is preferred for a rest because it is more esthetically acceptable, located closer to the centre of rotation of the tooth, and canines are best suited to accept horizontal forces due to their long roots and good crown/root ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Less Leverage is exerted against the tooth by Lingual rest\"}"
