    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most common organism responsible for acute apical abscess. From the documents, it is clear that multiple organisms can be involved in the development of an acute apical abscess. However, the most commonly mentioned organisms in the documents are Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Porphyromonas endodontalis. None of these organisms are listed in the answer choices. Therefore, I need to look at the organisms listed in the answer choices and see if any of them are mentioned in the documents as being commonly involved in acute apical abscesses. Treponema denticola is mentioned in several documents as being involved in acute apical abscesses, but it is not always listed as the most common organism. Dialister invisus is also mentioned in several documents, but again, it is not always listed as the most common organism. E. faecalis is not mentioned in any of the documents as being involved in acute apical abscesses. Therefore, based on the information in the documents, the most common organism listed in the answer choices that is responsible for acute apical abscesses is Treponema denticola.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
