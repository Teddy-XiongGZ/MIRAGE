    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein that is produced by the fetal liver during fetal development. According to Document [26], AFP is the major protein of fetal serum and most resembles albumin, which replaces it shortly after birth. It is produced by fetal liver and passes into the amniotic fluid (AF) via fetal urine. A small amount crosses the membranes into the maternal circulation. This suggests that the maximum level of AFP would be seen in the fetal serum, where it is primarily produced.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Fetal serum\"}"
