    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to identify which cysts are associated with vital teeth. From Document [10], I know that lateral periodontal cysts are associated with vital teeth. Document [0] and Document [11] indicate that dentigerous cysts are associated with unerupted teeth, but it doesn't specify whether these teeth are vital or not. Document [20] and Document [26] state that periapical cysts, also known as radicular cysts, are associated with non-vital teeth. Document [22] mentions that globulomaxillary cysts are associated with vital teeth. Document [13] and Document [23] do not provide clear information about the association of OKC (odontogenic keratocyst) with vital teeth. Therefore, based on the information from the documents, the cysts associated with vital teeth are dentigerous cyst, globulomaxillary cyst, and lateral periodontal cyst.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
