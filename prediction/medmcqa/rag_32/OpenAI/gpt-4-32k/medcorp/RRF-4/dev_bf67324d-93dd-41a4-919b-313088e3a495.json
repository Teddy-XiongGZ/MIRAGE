    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lidocaine is the most commonly used local anesthetic in dentistry, as mentioned in Document [0], Document [1], Document [16], and Document [17]. However, the documents do not provide information that it causes less depression of the CNS or less cardiovascular collapse. Document [4] and Document [7] mention that lidocaine has a low incidence of adverse reactions, which could include allergic reactions.

There is no information in the documents that lidocaine is 50 times more potent than procaine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
