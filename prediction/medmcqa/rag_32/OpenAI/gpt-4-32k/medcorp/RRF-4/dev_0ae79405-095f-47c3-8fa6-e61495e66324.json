    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the TCA intermediate used in haem synthesis. Document [13] states that during late stages of erythropoiesis, cellular metabolism is remodeled so that glutamine is the precursor for ALA following deamination to \u03b1-ketoglutarate and conversion to succinyl-CoA by \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH) without equilibration or passage through the TCA cycle. This suggests that succinyl-CoA is used in haem synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
