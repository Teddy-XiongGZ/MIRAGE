    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by the complex interaction between the plaque microorganisms and the host immune system. The innate immune response is activated when pathogens invade the periodontium. An excessive innate immune response leads to inflammation and the destruction of periodontal tissues, which then activates the adaptive immune response. Cell-mediated immune reactions, also known as delayed hypersensitivity, are a type of immune response that involves the activation of T lymphocytes. These T cells are sensitized to specific antigens, in this case, bacterial plaque antigens. Therefore, the presence of sensitized T lymphocytes in subjects with periodontitis would suggest that cell-mediated immune reactions are occurring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
