    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the given parasites does not infect hepatocytes. From the documents, we can see that P. falciparium (Document 10) and Toxoplasma (Document 12) do infect hepatocytes. However, there is no mention of Leishmania or Babesia infecting hepatocytes in any of the documents. Therefore, we need to rely on external knowledge. Leishmania is known to infect macrophages, not hepatocytes. Babesia, on the other hand, is known to infect red blood cells, not hepatocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Leishmania, D. Babesia\"}"
