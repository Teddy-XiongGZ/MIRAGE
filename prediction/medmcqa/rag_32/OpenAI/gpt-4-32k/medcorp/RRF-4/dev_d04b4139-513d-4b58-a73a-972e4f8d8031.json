    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention various factors that can contribute to the failure of partial dentures, including poor clasp design. However, none of the documents specifically mention the use of stress breakers, bar type clasps, altering tooth contours, or clasping only those teeth with fairly long crowns and normal bone support as solutions to avoid failure due to poor clasp design. However, Document [26] mentions a systematic approach to RPD design, starting with analysis of support, followed by stability and only then, deciding upon the necessary retentive elements. This suggests that a comprehensive approach to denture design, rather than a specific type of clasp or alteration to tooth contours, may be the best way to avoid failure. Therefore, none of the provided options seem to be the best answer based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
