    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars. Document [26] states that the root canal configuration of mandibular first molars varies strongly. Both the mesial and distal roots showed a high number of morphologic diversifications, including accessory canals. Document [16] also mentions that the complex anatomy of these teeth deserves attention during non-surgical or surgical endodontic treatment. Around the apex, isthmuses might be more prevalent in younger and female individuals. However, none of the documents provide a clear pattern that matches the options given in the question. Therefore, the answer should be the one that indicates variability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
