    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best formula to calculate the amount of fluid to be replenished in a burn patient. According to the documents, the most commonly used formula for estimating the amount of fluid resuscitation needed for a patient is the Parkland formula. The Parkland formula estimates the amount of fluid to be administered over the first 24 hours, with half of the calculated volume recommended to be administered over the first 8 hours. The formula is 4 mL x kg x percentage of TBSA burned. Therefore, the best formula to calculate the amount of fluid to be replenished in this case would be 4 mL/kg x %TBSA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
