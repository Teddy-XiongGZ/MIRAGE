    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the number of standard deviations that account for 99.73% of the variation in a normally distributed data set. According to the empirical rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule for a normal distribution, 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations, and 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. Therefore, 99.73% variation involves three standard deviations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
