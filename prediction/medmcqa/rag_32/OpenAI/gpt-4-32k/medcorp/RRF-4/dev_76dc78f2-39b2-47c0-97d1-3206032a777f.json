    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a type of transfusion reaction that occurs more than 24 hours after a transfusion. It is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells due to the presence of antibodies against the transfused blood. According to the documents, a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is a common feature of DHTR, indicating the presence of antibodies on the red blood cells. Haemoglobinuria, the presence of haemoglobin in the urine, is also a common symptom of DHTR, as the destruction of red blood cells releases haemoglobin into the bloodstream, which is then filtered out by the kidneys. Reduced haemoglobin is also a feature of DHTR, as the destruction of red blood cells leads to a decrease in the overall haemoglobin level. However, the presence of spherocytes, which are abnormally shaped red blood cells, is not mentioned in the context of DHTR in any of the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
