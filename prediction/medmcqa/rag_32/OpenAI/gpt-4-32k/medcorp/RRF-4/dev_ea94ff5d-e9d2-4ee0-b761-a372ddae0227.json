    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The interocclusal distance is the space between the upper and lower teeth when the jaw is at rest. If this distance is increased beyond physiologic limits, it could lead to a muscular imbalance. This is because the muscles that control the jaw may have to work harder or in a different way to bring the teeth together, which could lead to discomfort or pain. An occlusal disharmony in centric could also be a possible result, as the teeth may not align properly when the jaw is closed. However, a displacement of the mandibular or maxillary denture while yawning seems less likely to be the chief complaint, as this seems more related to the fit and stability of the denture rather than the interocclusal distance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
