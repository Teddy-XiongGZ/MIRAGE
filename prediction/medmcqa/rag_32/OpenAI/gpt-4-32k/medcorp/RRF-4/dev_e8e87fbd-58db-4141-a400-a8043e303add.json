    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about the relationship between pulp obliteration and the different types of dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentin dysplasia. Document [22] mentions dentinogenesis imperfecta but does not specify the type. It does mention that there is complete obliteration of the pulp chamber. Document [18] talks about dentin dysplasia and mentions that in primary teeth, the pulp chamber is usually completely obliterated but in permanent teeth, the pulp may become partially obliterated after eruption. There is no specific information about Type I, II, or III dentinogenesis imperfecta. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems that dentin dysplasia is the condition where complete pulp obliteration is not always seen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
