    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the duration of submerging NiTi files in NaOCl at 122-degree F to prevent damage to file corrosion. Document [1] mentions that instruments were immersed in 5% NaOCl at 50 degrees C (which is approximately 122 degrees F) for 5 minutes. Document [8] mentions that files were immersed in 4% NaOCl for 5, 10, and 20 minutes, and 1, 6 and 24 hours. However, it does not provide a specific time that prevents damage to file corrosion. Document [21] mentions that instruments were immersed in 5.25% NaOCl for 1 or 5 minutes. Document [23] mentions that files were immersed in 5.25% NaOCl for 1 or 2 hours at temperatures of 21 degrees C and 60 degrees C. Document [29] mentions that files were immersed in 5% NaOCl at 37\u00b0C for 5 min. Based on these documents, it seems that the immersion time in NaOCl varies, but none of the documents suggest an immersion time of 45 minutes or 2 hours at 122-degree F. The closest option based on the documents is 5 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
