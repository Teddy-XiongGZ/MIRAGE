    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of nerve fiber that is least susceptible to local anesthetic (LA) blockade. From Document [0], it is stated that C fibers are the least sensitive to blockade by local anesthetic agents. This is also supported by Document [3] which states that type C fibers (pain) are blocked after type B fibers (sympathetic tone). Document [25] also supports this by stating that C fibers are the least sensitive to local anesthetic blockade.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. C fibers\"}"
