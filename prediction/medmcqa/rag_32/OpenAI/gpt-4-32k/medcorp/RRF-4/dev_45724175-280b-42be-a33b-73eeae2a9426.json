    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the histological landmark that signifies the end of cleaning, shaping, and obturation in endodontic treatment. The cementodentinal junction (CDJ) is the interface between the cementum and dentin in a tooth, but it is not typically used as a landmark for the termination of these procedures. The apical foramen is the natural opening in the root of a tooth, but it is not a histological structure. The apical constriction is the narrowest part of the root canal and is often used as a reference point in endodontic treatment. Therefore, the apical constriction is the most appropriate answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
