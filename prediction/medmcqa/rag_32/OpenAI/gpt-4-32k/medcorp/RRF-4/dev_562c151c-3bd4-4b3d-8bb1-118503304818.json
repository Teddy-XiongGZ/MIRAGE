    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endodontically treated teeth are more susceptible to fracture due to several reasons. According to Document [0], these fractures might occur because of the loss of tooth structure and induced stresses caused by endodontic and restorative procedures. Document [1] also mentions that the dentine of pulpless teeth is stiffer and more susceptible to fracture. Document [4] states that endodontically treated teeth undergo loss of tooth substance due to dental caries, endodontic therapy or previous restoration and changes in physical characteristics, such as a reduced modulus of elasticity, which often leads to increased fracture susceptibility. Therefore, the answer should be the option that includes all these factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
