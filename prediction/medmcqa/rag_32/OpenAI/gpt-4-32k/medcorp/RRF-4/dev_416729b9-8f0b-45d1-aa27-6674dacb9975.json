    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [1], Document [3], Document [4], and Document [17], low infusion rates of dopamine (0.5 to 2 micrograms/kg per minute) act on the visceral vasculature to produce vasodilation, including the kidneys, resulting in increased urinary flow. Intermediate infusion rates (from 2 to 10 micrograms/kg/min) stimulate myocardial contractility and increase electrical conductivity in the heart leading to increased cardiac output. Therefore, at low infusion rates of 3-5 mcg/kg/min, dopamine increases cardiac contractility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
