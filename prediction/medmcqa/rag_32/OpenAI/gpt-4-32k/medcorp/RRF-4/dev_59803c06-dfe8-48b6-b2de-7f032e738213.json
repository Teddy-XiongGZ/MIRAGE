    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle spindles are composed of intrafusal muscle fibers, which include nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. The central zone of the muscle spindle, where the sensory nerve endings are located, does not contain actin and myosin, which are contractile proteins. This makes option A correct. The peripheral zone of the muscle spindle, which is the area outside the central zone, does contain actin and myosin, making option C incorrect. Regarding the myosin ATPase activity in nuclear bag fibers, the documents do not provide specific information. However, it is known that myosin ATPase activity is related to the speed of muscle contraction, with higher activity associated with faster contraction. Therefore, without specific information, it is not possible to determine whether options B and D are correct or incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
