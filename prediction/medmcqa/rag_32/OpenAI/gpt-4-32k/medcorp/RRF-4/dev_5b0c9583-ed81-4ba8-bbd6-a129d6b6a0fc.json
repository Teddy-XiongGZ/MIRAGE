    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the replacement of Bismuth Oxide in MTA to prevent grey discoloration of the crown. Document [24] mentions that a filler loading of 30% zirconium oxide to Portland cement resulted in a material with comparable properties to mineral trioxide aggregate. However, the options do not include zirconium oxide. Document [16] mentions that silver/tin alloy and gold powder imparted the necessary radiopacity to a calcium silicate-based cement. But these options are also not included. Document [23] mentions that the bismuth oxide can be replaced by other radiopacifiers that do not affect the hydration mechanism of the resultant material. Among the given options, Titanium Oxide is a known radiopacifier used in dental materials.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Titanium Oxide\"}"
