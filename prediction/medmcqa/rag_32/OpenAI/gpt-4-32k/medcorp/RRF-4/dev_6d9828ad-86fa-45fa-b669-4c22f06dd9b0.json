    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lingual extension of a lower denture is limited by several factors. The modiolus, a point located near the corner of the mouth where several facial muscles converge, can limit the extension of a lower denture as it affects the movement and flexibility of the mouth. The mylohyoid muscle, which forms the floor of the mouth, can also limit the extension of a lower denture as it affects the shape and space available in the oral cavity. The sublingual salivary glands, located beneath the tongue, can limit the extension of a lower denture as they occupy space in the oral cavity and their function could be affected by the denture. However, the origin of the genioglossus, a muscle of the tongue, does not directly limit the lingual extension of a lower denture. The genioglossus primarily affects the movement of the tongue rather than the space or shape of the oral cavity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Origin of genioglossus\"}"
