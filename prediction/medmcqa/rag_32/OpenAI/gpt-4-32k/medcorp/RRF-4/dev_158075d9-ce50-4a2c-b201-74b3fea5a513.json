    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biliary atresia is a condition that affects the bile ducts in infants, leading to liver damage. It's crucial to diagnose it early for better outcomes. From the documents, it's clear that there are several methods to diagnose biliary atresia, including Hepatic scintigraphy, ERCP, USG, and CT scan. However, the choice of investigation depends on the accuracy, safety, and availability of the method. Hepatic scintigraphy (Document 30) has high sensitivity but lower specificity, meaning it can give false positives. ERCP (Document 24, 26, 21) is safe and accurate but not widely available. USG (Document 20) is noninvasive, inexpensive, and very useful, but a normal USG exam does not rule out biliary atresia. CT scan is not mentioned as a primary diagnostic tool in the documents. Considering these factors, USG seems to be the most practical and accessible choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. USG\"}"
