    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of tissue that forms after flap surgery in a previously denuded area. Document [17] provides information on this topic, stating that the complete process of healing and maturation of the peri-implant tissues takes longer than around teeth. However, the established peri-implant soft connective tissue resembles a scar tissue in composition, fibre orientation, and vasculature. This suggests that the soft tissue tooth interface that forms after flap surgery in a previously denuded area is a scar tissue attachment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
