    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Next generation sequencing is a technique that can be used to sequence DNA or RNA, so it is not primarily RNA based. PCR is a technique used to amplify DNA, so it is not primarily RNA based. Sanger's technique is a method of DNA sequencing, so it is not primarily RNA based. Western blotting is a technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample, so it is not primarily RNA based. Therefore, none of the options are primarily RNA based techniques.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
