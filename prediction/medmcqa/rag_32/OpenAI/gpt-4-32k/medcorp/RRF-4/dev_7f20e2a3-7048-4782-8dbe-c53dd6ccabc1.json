    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most effective method to reduce patient somatic exposure during radiography. Document [9] mentions that patient dose may be reduced by half by changing from D-speed film to E-speed film for intraoral radiography. Document [24] also mentions the advent of E-speed film as a way to reduce dose. Document [17] mentions the use of lead aprons, but it doesn't quantify how much this reduces exposure. Document [20] mentions the use of beam-restricting film holders, leaded aprons and thyroid collars, but again, it doesn't quantify the reduction. Document [16] mentions reducing the time of exposure, increasing distance, and shielding as ways to reduce dose, but it doesn't specifically mention an open ended, shielded cone or added filtration. Based on the information provided, it seems that using E-speed film is the most effective method mentioned for reducing patient somatic exposure during radiography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
