    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p-value is a statistical measure that helps scientists determine whether their hypotheses are correct. It is the probability that, if the study were repeated an infinite number of times, one would expect the findings to be as, or more extreme, than the one calculated in this test. A p-value of 0.10 means that there is a 10% chance that the results could have occurred by chance. It does not mean that the test is 90% reproducible, nor does it mean that 90% of patients will benefit from the drug. It also does not mean that 90% of test results could have occurred by chance, as the p-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results of a statistical hypothesis test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
