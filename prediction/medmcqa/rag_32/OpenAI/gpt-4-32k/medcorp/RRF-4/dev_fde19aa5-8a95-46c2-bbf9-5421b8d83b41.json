    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The gingival sulcus is the space between the tooth and the surrounding gingival tissue. The depth of the sulcus is bounded by two entities: apically by the gingival fibers of the connective tissue attachment and coronally by the free gingival margin. Therefore, the depth of the clinical gingival sulcus is the distance from the gingival margin to the apical extension of the junctional epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Apical extension of junctional epithelium\"}"
