    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Trismus is defined as a painful restriction in opening the mouth due to a muscle spasm. It can be caused by a variety of reasons, including inflammation of the muscles of mastication. The muscles of mastication include the masseter, temporalis, and the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles. The buccinator is not a muscle of mastication, but rather a muscle of facial expression. The facial nerve is responsible for facial expressions, not mastication. The superior constrictor is a muscle of the pharynx involved in swallowing, not mastication. Therefore, the medial pterygoid, being a muscle of mastication, is the most likely to be involved in trismus due to inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
