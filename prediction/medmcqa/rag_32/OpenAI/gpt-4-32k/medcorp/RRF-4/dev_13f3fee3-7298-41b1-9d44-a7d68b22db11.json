    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several methods for removing submandibular calculus. Document [0] mentions excision of the submandibular gland as a method, which corresponds to choice C. Document [1] describes a technique where the submandibular duct is ligated and the calculus is removed, which is similar to choice D. Document [3] talks about minimally invasive techniques, which could include dilatation of the duct (choice A), but it doesn't explicitly mention this method. Document [5] describes a case where a calculus was removed by sialolithotomy, which involves making an incision in the duct (choice D). Document [6] also mentions transoral removal of calculi, which involves making an incision in the duct (choice D). Document [20] describes a method where the stone is removed via an extraoral incision with preservation of the SMG, which is similar to choice D. Document [30] also mentions transoral removal of stones, which involves making an incision in the duct (choice D). Based on these documents, it seems that the most commonly mentioned method for removing submandibular calculus is making an incision in the duct and removing the calculus (choice D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
