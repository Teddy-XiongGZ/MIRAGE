    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about the composition of gutta-percha. Document [5] states that a good commercial gutta-percha would have around 80% gutta and 15% or less of resin. This contradicts with choice A which states that it contains 60-70% gutta-percha and 20% ZnO. Next, I need to find information about the sterilization of gutta-percha. Document [29] suggests that gutta-percha does not need to be chemically decontaminated before use, but it does not mention anything about sterilization by heating. Then, I need to find information about the brittleness of gutta-percha over time. Document [19] mentions that the physical property of gutta-percha becomes unstable when it is heated at over 300\u00b0C or subjected to cyclic heating, which could imply that it becomes brittle over time. Lastly, I need to find information about the forms of gutta-percha. Document [6] mentions alpha- and beta-gutta-percha, confirming that gutta-percha has two forms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
