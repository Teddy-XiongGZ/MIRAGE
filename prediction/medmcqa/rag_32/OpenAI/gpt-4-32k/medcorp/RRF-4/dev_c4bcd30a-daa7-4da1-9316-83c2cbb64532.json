    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The contractile element in a skeletal muscle is the part that is responsible for the contraction and relaxation of the muscle. According to Document [1], the contractile process involves the sliding of actin and myosin filaments alongside each other. These filaments are present in the myofibrils, which are part of the muscle fibers. Therefore, the contractile element in a skeletal muscle is present in the myofibril.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Myofibril\"}"
