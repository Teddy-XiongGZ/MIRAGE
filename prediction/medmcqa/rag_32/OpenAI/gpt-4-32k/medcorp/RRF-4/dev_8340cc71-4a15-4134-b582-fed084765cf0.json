    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ergometrine is a medication used to cause contractions of the uterus to treat heavy vaginal bleeding after childbirth, as stated in Document [0]. This means it is not contraindicated in postpartum hemorrhage, so option D is incorrect. Document [1] mentions that ergometrine has abortifacient effects, but it doesn't state that it's contraindicated in abortion, so option B is not necessarily correct. Document [3] states that ergometrine should not be used in the first and second stages of labor, which implies it's not contraindicated in the induction of labor, so option C is incorrect. Document [3] and Document [12] both mention that ergometrine is contraindicated in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, so option A is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
