    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucocorticoids are known to have anti-inflammatory effects. According to the documents, they achieve this by suppressing the immune response, inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and reducing the synthesis of arachidonic acid. They also inhibit the functions of tissue macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells. However, there is no specific mention of them reducing the activity of histamine, the release of histamine, fibroblastic activity, or neutrophils. But, Document [10] mentions that glucocorticoids decrease capillary permeability by reducing the amount of histamine released by basophils and mast cells. This suggests that glucocorticoids may indirectly reduce the activity of histamine by reducing its release.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Release of histamine\"}"
