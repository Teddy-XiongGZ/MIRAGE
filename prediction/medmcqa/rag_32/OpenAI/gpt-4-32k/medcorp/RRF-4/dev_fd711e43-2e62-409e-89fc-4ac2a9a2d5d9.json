    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for an important marker of male infertility in semen analysis. According to Document [0], several parameters are evaluated in a semen analysis, including semen volume, total sperm number, sperm concentration, vitality, progressive motility, total motility, and morphologically normal forms. Document [1] also mentions sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and vitality as standard procedures of semen analysis. Document [2] mentions that semen analysis provides information on the functional status of the seminiferous tubules, epididymis, and accessory sex glands. Document [3] mentions that infection of the male genital tract can lead to leukocytospermia which may affect semen quality. Document [4] mentions that inflammation may affect reproduction through anatomical alteration of the male accessory gland, functional alteration of the male accessory gland, and/or direct negative effects on the spermatozoa. Document [5] mentions that semen can be assessed by various attributes: the total number of spermatozoa, the fluid volume, sperm concentration, and the nature of the spermatozoa; their viability, motility, and shape as well as the composition of the secretions. Document [7] mentions that the characteristics measured by semen analysis are only some of the factors in semen quality. Document [8] mentions that a routine semen analysis should include: physical characteristics of semen (color, odor, pH, viscosity and liquefaction), volume, concentration, morphology and sperm motility and progression. Document [9] mentions that the levels of 15 out of 21 markers, assayed from the seminal plasma of infertile males, were significantly altered in comparison to fertile controls. Document [10] mentions that semen analysis is not a sensible nor a specific tool for detecting infertility in the male. Document [11] mentions that the semen analysis is the main diagnostic tool for evaluating the male fertility potential. Document [12] mentions that oxidative stress is the causative factor in 25% of infertile males. Document [13] mentions that a semen analysis typically measures the number of sperm per millilitre of ejaculate, and analyzes the morphology (shape) and motility (ability to swim forward) of the sperm. Document [14] mentions that semen analyses are performed as part of the assessment of male factor infertility. Document [15] mentions that the semen analysis is the cornerstone of laboratory evaluation of male infertility. Document [16] mentions that the capability to analyze semen is not new but until recently was a clinical art practiced well by only a few experts. Document [17] mentions that male infertility has emerged as an important cause of infertility worldwide. Document [18] mentions that semen analysis initiates the evaluation of the male partner of an infertile couple. Document [19] mentions that the WHO has provided normal limits of reference for semen analysis. Document [20] mentions that previous studies have given conflicting results about the effect of generally infection and Chlamydia trachomatis on seminal ILs and semen parameters. Document [21] mentions that the incidence of male reproductive failure leading to infertility, whether due to delayed parenthood, environmental issues, genetic factors, drugs, etc., is increasing throughout the world. Document [22] mentions that semen analysis is a basic step in the investigation of several disturbances affecting the male genital tract. Document [23] mentions that semen analysis is a laboratory test that is performed to assess male fertility. Document [24] mentions that rapid developments have occurred in the management of couple infertility due to a male factor. Document [25] mentions that previous studies have given conflicting results about the effect of generally infection and Chlamydia trachomatis on seminal ILs and semen parameters. Document [26] mentions that semen analysis is a basic step in the investigation of several disturbances affecting the male genital tract. Document [27] mentions that semen analysis is a laboratory test that is performed to assess male fertility. Document [28] mentions that the ejaculate specimen represents an output derived from the efficiency of three essential biological events: testicular production of sperm, progression and maturation of testicular sperm through epididymides, neurophysiological integrity of the mechanisms leading to the final process of ejaculation. Document [29] mentions that semen analysis is a basic step in the investigation of several disturbances affecting the male genital tract. Document [30] mentions that semen analysis is a laboratory test that is performed to assess male fertility. Document [31] mentions that semen analysis is a basic step in the investigation of several disturbances affecting the male genital tract. All of these documents mention different parameters that are evaluated in a semen analysis, but none of them specifically mention one as the most important. However, sperm motility and concentration are frequently mentioned as important parameters in semen analysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Motility\"}"
