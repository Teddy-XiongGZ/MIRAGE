    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Smoke inhalation can cause hypoxemia, which is a condition in which there is a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. This is mentioned in Document [5]. Anemic hypoxia occurs when there is a decrease in the total amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in the blood. This can occur due to carbon monoxide poisoning, which is a common systemic toxicity after smoke inhalation as mentioned in Document [10]. Ischemic hypoxia occurs when there is inadequate blood flow to a tissue or organ. Smoke inhalation can cause systemic ischemia as mentioned in Document [31]. Therefore, all of the above are potential causes of death due to smoke inhalation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above\"}"
