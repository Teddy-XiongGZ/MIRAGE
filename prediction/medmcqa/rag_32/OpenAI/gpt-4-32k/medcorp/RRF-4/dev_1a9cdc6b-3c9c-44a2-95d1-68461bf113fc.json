    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the factor that does not contribute to the inability of the spinal cord to regenerate after injury. From the documents, we know that spinal cord injury can result in permanent damage due to several factors. Document [6] mentions that in a 'complete' spinal injury, all functions below the injured area are lost, indicating the difficulty of regeneration. Document [9] talks about the potential for nerve regeneration after injury to the spinal cord being limited because of the absence of major neurogenesis. This could be linked to a lack of growth factors (Choice B). Document [20] mentions that the peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for regeneration, which could be due to the presence of endoneural tubes (Choice A). Document [19] talks about the severe neurologic deficit following gunshot wounds even without violation of the spinal canal, which could be due to the presence of a glial scar (Choice C). However, none of the documents mention a lack of myelin inhibiting substance (Choice D) as a factor preventing spinal cord regeneration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
