    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, we know that mitochondria are involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids (Document [30]), DNA synthesis (Document [2]), and protein synthesis (Document [9]). However, there is no mention of fatty acid synthesis occurring in mitochondria. In fact, Document [30] suggests that cells in the central nervous system have to manufacture their own fatty acids from carbohydrates, implying that this process does not occur in mitochondria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
