    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about the location of bronchial cysts. Document [26] mentions that there were 14 mediastinal, 2 hilar, and 6 intrapulmonary bronchogenic cysts in a study of 22 patients. This suggests that bronchial cysts are not mostly mediastinal, which contradicts choice A. Step 2: Look for information about the percentage of bronchial cysts that occur in the lungs. Document [15] states that the location was intrapulmonary in 25 cases and mediastinal in 8 cases out of 33 cases. This suggests that a significant percentage of bronchial cysts occur in the lungs, which aligns with choice B. Step 3: Search for information about whether bronchial cysts are usually multiloculated. Document [5] describes bronchogenic cysts as frequently unilocular, which contradicts choice C. Step 4: Look for information about how often bronchial cysts are infected. Document [22] mentions that 10 patients (45%) presented with complications, including infected cysts. This suggests that bronchial cysts are not infected quite often, which contradicts choice D. Based on this analysis, the statement that bronchial cysts are usually multiloculated (choice C) is not true according to the provided documents.
