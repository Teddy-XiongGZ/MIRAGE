    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Atropine is a medication used to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings as well as some types of slow heart rate and to decrease saliva production during surgery. It is an anticholinergic drug, which means it blocks the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the body.

Therefore, bradycardia (slow heart rate) is not a typical effect of atropine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
