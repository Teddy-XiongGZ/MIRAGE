    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the onset of action for proparacaine. Document [0] states that the onset of action for bupivacaine was not significantly different from that of topical 0.5% proparacaine. However, it does not provide a specific time frame. Document [1] mentions proparacaine but does not provide information about its onset of action. Document [3] mentions that proparacaine lasts 1.3 minutes longer than tetracaine, but it does not provide the onset time. Document [4] mentions that the maximum anesthetic effect with proparacaine treatment occurred at 10 minutes, but this is referring to the peak effect, not the onset. Document [17] mentions that proparacaine has a single irreversible anodic peak at around + 900 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in pH 6.0 Britton-Robinson buffer solution, but this does not provide information about the onset of action. Document [23] mentions that the mean duration of maximal anesthesia was 34.2 min with tetracaine compared to 21.5 min and 19 min with proparacaine and lidocaine respectively, but this is referring to the duration of maximal effect, not the onset. Document [27] mentions that prior instillation of topical proparacaine produced a statistically significant difference in pupil diameter for subjects with light-colored irides, but this does not provide information about the onset of action. Document [30] mentions that the use of a topical anesthetic before the instillation of a mydriatic is recommended in order to enhance both the rate and magnitude of pupillary dilation, but this does not provide information about the onset of action for proparacaine. None of the documents provide a clear answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
