    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the starting point of a chewing stroke. Document [0] provides information about the chewing stroke, stating that the closing strokes are more stable than opening strokes, but it does not specify the starting point of a chewing stroke. Document [4] mentions that the most important portion of the chewing cycle is the area entering and leaving the intercuspal position where gliding contacts occur. This suggests that the chewing stroke might start from the intercuspal position. However, the terms CO and CR are not mentioned in the documents, so it's unclear what they refer to. Based on the information available, the most likely answer is that the chewing stroke starts from the intercuspal position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
