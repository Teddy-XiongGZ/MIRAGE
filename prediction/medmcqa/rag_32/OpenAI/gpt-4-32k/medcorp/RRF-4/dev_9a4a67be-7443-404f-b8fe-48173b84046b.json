    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Centric interference and working interference are types of occlusal interferences that can affect the normal function of the teeth. Document [1] mentions that occlusal interference can be managed by removing the premature contact point or through restorative materials. However, Document [0] suggests that the prophylactic grinding of teeth, which would include reducing supporting cusps, lacks a rational basis and could have different consequences than functional wear. Therefore, while it might be technically possible to remove these interferences by reducing supporting cusps, it is not necessarily advisable or the best approach.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Yes but we should avoid it\"}"
