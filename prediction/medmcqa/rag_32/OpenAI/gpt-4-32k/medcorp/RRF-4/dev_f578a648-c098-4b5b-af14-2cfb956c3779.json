    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the causes of numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue. From the documents, it is clear that these symptoms can be due to nerve damage or injury, particularly to the lingual nerve or the trigeminal nerve, which supply sensation to the tongue.
