    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the ionic exchange between the enamel surface and the environment. Document [0] mentions that the internal medium of a tooth is connected with the electrolyte solutions surrounding it due to the porous structure of the medium, which suggests that ionic exchange can occur. Document [1] discusses the labile pools of ions in enamel at various developmental stages, indicating that ionic exchange can occur during enamel development. Document [3] talks about the rates of ion exchange in enamel under different conditions. Document [25] discusses the ionic composition of solutions and the time of treatment, which can affect the interaction of fluoride on superficial dental enamel. This suggests that ionic exchange can occur under certain conditions and at certain times. None of the documents suggest that ionic exchange stops at a certain age or stage of enamel maturation. Therefore, the most likely answer is that ionic exchange continues throughout life.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
