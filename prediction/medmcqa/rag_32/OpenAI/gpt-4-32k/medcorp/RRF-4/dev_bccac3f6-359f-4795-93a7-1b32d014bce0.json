    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [3] states that antinuclear antibody testing is a useful way to confirm the diagnosis of lupus when the clinical suspicion is high, or to exclude it in cases when SLE is in the differential diagnosis but the likelihood of it is low to moderate. Document [2] mentions that ANA-specific antibodies are specific for systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID) and are useful in making a diagnosis in ANA-negative patients as well with clinical suspicion. Document [28] states that ANA positivity is common in patients with RA, but the presence or development of ANA did not increase the likelihood of withdrawing from treatment. No case of drug induced SLE was seen over five years in this study. Therefore, it seems that all the diseases mentioned in the options can be diagnosed with positive ANA, but they can also be diagnosed without positive ANA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
