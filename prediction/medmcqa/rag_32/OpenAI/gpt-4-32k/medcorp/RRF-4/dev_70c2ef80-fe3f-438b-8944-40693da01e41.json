    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several techniques to improve the marginal adaptation of composite restorations. Document [2] mentions an incremental technique for placing composite restorations to reduce the volume of the resin that is polymerized, which improves the marginal adaptation. Document [3] talks about the use of biofillers to improve microleakage and marginal adaptability. Document [11] suggests that a modified incremental placement technique with a transparent glass pin reduces marginal leakage. Document [14] suggests that the use of a flowable composite as an intermediate layer can improve the marginal adaptation of composite restorations. However, none of the documents suggest that a moisture-free environment, application of pressure, acid etching, or continued packing can improve the marginal adaptation of composite restorations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
