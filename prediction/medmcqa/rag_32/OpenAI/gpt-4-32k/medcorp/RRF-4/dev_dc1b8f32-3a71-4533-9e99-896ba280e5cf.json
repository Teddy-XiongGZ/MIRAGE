    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes, meaning it is caused by mutations in a single gene. According to Document [19], the most common forms of MODY are MODY2 and MODY3, caused by mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A) genes, respectively. However, Document [17] states that the most common causes of MODY are mutations in the GCK and HNF1B genes. To resolve this discrepancy, I will look for more documents that mention the most common type of MODY. Document [15] confirms that mutations in the GCK and HNF1A genes account for up to 80% of all MODY cases. Therefore, the most common genetic mutations seen in MODY are in the GCK and HNF1A genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Glucokinase\"}"
