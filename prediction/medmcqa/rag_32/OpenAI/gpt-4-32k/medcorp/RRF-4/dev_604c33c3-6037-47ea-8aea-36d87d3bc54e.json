    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the source of plasma replacement during hemorrhage. Plasma is a component of blood, not produced by organs like the kidney, spleen, or muscle. Bone marrow is responsible for producing blood cells, not plasma.

In the case of hemorrhage, lost plasma is typically replaced by intravenous fluids or blood transfusions as indicated in the documents, not by any of the organs listed in the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the options\"}"
