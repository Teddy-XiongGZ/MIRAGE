    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Molybdenum is a common component in many alloys, including those used in medical and dental applications. According to Document [0], molybdenum-based alloys exhibit higher creep resistance and strength at high temperatures. Document [7] also mentions that molybdenum contributes to the corrosion resistance of certain types of stainless steels. Document [16] further supports this, stating that molybdenum is used in alloys for its strength at high temperatures, resistance to wear, and low coefficient of friction. Therefore, the function of molybdenum in base metal alloys is to increase strength and corrosion resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
