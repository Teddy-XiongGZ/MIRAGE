    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the deepest among the given blistering disorders. From the documents, we can gather that IgA pemphigus and Bullous pemphigoid are subepidermal blistering disorders, meaning they occur below the epidermis. PV, or Pemphigus Vulgaris, is an intraepidermal blistering disorder, meaning it occurs within the epidermis. EBD, or Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica, is a blistering disorder that affects the dermal-epidermal junction, which is deeper than both the intraepidermal and subepidermal layers. Therefore, EBD is the deepest among these.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. EBD\"}"
