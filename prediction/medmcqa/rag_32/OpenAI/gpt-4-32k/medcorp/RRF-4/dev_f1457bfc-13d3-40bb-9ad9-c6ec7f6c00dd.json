    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The otic ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion that provides innervation to the parotid gland. The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the otic ganglion are carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve, specifically its tympanic branch. These fibers then form the tympanic plexus in the middle ear and leave it to form the lesser petrosal nerve, which synapses at the otic ganglion. Therefore, the lesser petrosal nerve carries the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the otic ganglion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lesser petrosal nerve\"}"
