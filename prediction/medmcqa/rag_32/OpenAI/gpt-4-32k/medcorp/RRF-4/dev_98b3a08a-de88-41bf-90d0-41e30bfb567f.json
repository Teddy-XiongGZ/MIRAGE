    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not mention anything about the plane of orientation being used to establish occlusal plane, measure height and length of posterior teeth, establish an arbitrary plane on the articulator, or divide the distance between upper and lower cast equally. However, from the documents, it is clear that the plane of orientation or plane of rotation is used to describe the orientation or rotation of an object in space. It is a concept used in geometry and physics to describe the position and movement of objects in three-dimensional space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
