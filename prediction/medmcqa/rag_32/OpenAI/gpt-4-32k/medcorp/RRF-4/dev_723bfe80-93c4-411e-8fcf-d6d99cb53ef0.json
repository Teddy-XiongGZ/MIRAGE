    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the minimum width required in the ridge for placing two 4 mm implants. According to the general rule of thumb in implantology, there should be at least 1 mm of bone surrounding the implant on all sides. Therefore, for two 4 mm implants, we would need 2 mm of bone on either side of the implants and 2 mm between the implants. This adds up to 4 mm for the implants themselves, 4 mm for the surrounding bone, and 2 mm for the space between the implants, totaling 10 mm. However, none of the options provided match this calculation. It's possible that the question assumes a larger space between the implants for safety, which is often recommended to be around 3 mm. In that case, the total width required would be 11 mm, but this option is also not provided. Therefore, it seems there might be a mistake in the question or the provided options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
