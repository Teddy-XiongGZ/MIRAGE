    "First, I will review the documents that mention the adverse effects of Escitalopram. These are documents [5], [11], [15], [18], [26], [27], [29], [31]. After reviewing these documents, I can see that nausea and anorgasmia are mentioned as adverse effects of Escitalopram. However, there is no mention of vivid dreams or sialorrhoea as adverse effects. Therefore, the answer should be either vivid dreams or sialorrhoea. To confirm, I will review the documents again to see if there is any mention of these two options. After a second review, I still do not see any mention of vivid dreams or sialorrhoea as adverse effects of Escitalopram. Therefore, the answer should be either vivid dreams or sialorrhoea. Since the question asks for only one answer, I will choose the one that seems less likely to be an adverse effect of an SSRI like Escitalopram. SSRIs can cause various neurological and psychological effects, so vivid dreams could potentially be an adverse effect. On the other hand, sialorrhoea, which is excessive salivation, seems less likely to be caused by an SSRI. Therefore, I will choose sialorrhoea as the answer. The final answer is: D. Sialorrhoea The final output in json format is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I reviewed the documents that mention the adverse effects of Escitalopram.
