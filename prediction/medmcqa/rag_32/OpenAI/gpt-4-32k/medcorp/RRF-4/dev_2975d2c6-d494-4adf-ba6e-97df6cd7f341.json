    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Inversion of the foot is the movement of the sole towards the median plane. To answer this question, I need to find out which muscles are responsible for the inversion of the foot. From Document [12], I can see that the tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and extensor hallucis longus are involved in foot inversion. However, the peroneus longus is responsible for foot eversion, not inversion, as stated in Document [4]. Therefore, the peroneus longus does not work for inversion of the foot.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Peroneus longus\"}"
