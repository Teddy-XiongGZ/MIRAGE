    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fourth generation of apex locators is mentioned in several documents. Document [4] states that the third generation of apex locators solved the problem of detecting the apex in the presence of conducting fluids by using two alternating frequencies and calculating the impedance between them. The fourth generation of apex locators is described as a diverse group, with some using multifrequency currents. This suggests that the fourth generation of apex locators is based on multiple frequency ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Multiple frequency ratio\"}"
