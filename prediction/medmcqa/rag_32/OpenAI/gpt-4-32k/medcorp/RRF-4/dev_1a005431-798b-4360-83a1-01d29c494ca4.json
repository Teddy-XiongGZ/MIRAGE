    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiographs are commonly used in dental practice to obtain information that is not available by other means. They can help in the diagnosis of various dental conditions. Cementoma can be identified on radiographs as a radiopaque mass, usually attached to the roots of a tooth. Subluxation of teeth can be identified on radiographs as a displacement of the tooth from its socket. Impacted canines can be identified on radiographs as teeth that have not erupted into their expected position. However, an acute alveolar abscess, which is an infection in the mouth, may not be visible on radiographs, especially in the early stages. The presence of an abscess is usually determined by clinical signs and symptoms such as pain, swelling, and fever.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
