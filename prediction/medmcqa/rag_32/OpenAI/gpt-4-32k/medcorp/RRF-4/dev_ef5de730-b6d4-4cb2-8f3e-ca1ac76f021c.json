    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the method of intubation used in long surgical procedures. Document [13] mentions that tracheal intubation is the placement of a flexible plastic or rubber tube into the trachea to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs. The most widely used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal apparatus into the trachea. This suggests that an endotracheal tube is commonly used in surgical procedures. None of the documents provide information that suggests a nasotracheal tube with or without a cuff, or LIMA would be used in long surgical procedures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Endotracheal tube\"}"
