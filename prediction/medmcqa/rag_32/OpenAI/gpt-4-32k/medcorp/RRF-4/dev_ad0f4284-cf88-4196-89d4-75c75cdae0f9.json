    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ethmoid bone is a complex structure that contributes to the formation of the nasal cavity, the orbit of the eye, and the anterior cranial fossa. It consists of several parts including the cribriform plate, the ethmoidal labyrinth, and the perpendicular plate. The ethmoid bone also contains ethmoidal air cells or sinuses. The uncinate process and the crista galli are parts of the ethmoid bone. Agger nasi cells are the most anterior ethmoidal air cells, so they are also part of the ethmoid bone. The inferior turbinate, however, is not a part of the ethmoid bone. It is a separate structure found in the nasal cavity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
