    "Step 1: Identify the key points in the question. The question is asking about the incorrect statement regarding rapid sequence induction (RSI) in a cardiac patient in an emergency setting. Step 2: Review each choice in light of the documents provided. Choice A: Document [12] and [25] confirm that the induction drug and neuromuscular blocking agent are administered in rapid succession with no time allowed for manual ventilation. So, this statement is true. Choice B: Document [9] and [25] mention pre-oxygenation as a part of the RSI process. So, this statement is true. Choice C: Document [0] and [9] mention the application of cricoid pressure (also known as the Sellick manoeuvre) until the airway is secured. So, this statement is true. Choice D: Document [27] and [31] mention that etomidate, fentanyl, ketamine and rocuronium are preferred over thiopentone and succinylcholine for induction and muscle relaxation in modern RSI, especially in trauma patients. So, this statement seems to be false. Step 3: Choose the answer. The incorrect statement is D. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first identified the key points in the question. Then I reviewed each choice in light of the documents provided. I found that choices A, B, and C are true according to the documents. However, choice D is false because modern RSI prefers other drugs over thiopentone and succinylcholine for induction and muscle relaxation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
