    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a type of cry that involves no tears or sobs, but a constant whining noise. Looking at the documents, Document [1] mentions different types of crying and their acoustic features. However, it does not provide a clear match to the description in the question. Document [17] describes three types of cries in infants: a basic cry, an anger cry, and a pain cry. None of these match the description in the question either. Document [28] also talks about infant crying but does not provide a match. The answer does not seem to be present in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
