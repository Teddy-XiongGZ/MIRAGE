    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rooting reflex is a primitive motor reflex that is present at birth and helps infants find the mother's nipple for breastfeeding. According to Document [0] and Document [1], the rooting reflex lasts about 4 to 6 months until it is replaced by voluntary motor functions as the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex develops. Therefore, the reflex disappears around the 4th to 6th month. However, the options provided only include specific months, not a range. Since the reflex could potentially disappear as early as the 4th month, the closest answer would be 4 months.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
