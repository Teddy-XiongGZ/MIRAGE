    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the absolute indication for open reduction in condylar fractures. Document [8] states that the absolute indication for open reduction of mandibular condylar fractures is the inability to achieve satisfactory occlusion by closed method. Document [16] suggests that open reduction may produce functional benefits to patients with severely displaced condylar process fractures. Document [23] states that more consistent occlusal results can be expected when fractures of the mandibular condylar process are treated by open reduction. However, none of the documents directly match the provided answer choices. The closest match is choice D, which refers to a situation where the condyle is separated from the stump, which could be interpreted as a severe displacement of the condylar process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
