    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a form of cell death, as mentioned in multiple documents. It is not related to liquefaction degeneration, which is a type of tissue necrosis. Coagulative necrosis is a type of cell death, but it is different from apoptosis. Neo angiogenesis refers to the formation of new blood vessels, which is not related to cell death. Epithelial dysplasia refers to abnormal growth or development of cells, which is also not related to cell death. Therefore, none of the options perfectly describe apoptosis, but coagulative necrosis is the closest as it is a form of cell death, albeit different from apoptosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
