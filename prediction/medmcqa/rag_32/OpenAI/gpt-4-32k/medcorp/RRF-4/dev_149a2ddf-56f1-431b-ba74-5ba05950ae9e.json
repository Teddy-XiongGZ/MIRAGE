    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Embrasures are the spaces between the proximal surfaces of adjacent teeth. They are formed by the interdental papilla of the gingiva, the adjacent teeth, and the contact point where the two teeth meet. There are four embrasures for every contact area: facial (also called labial or buccal), lingual (or palatal), occlusal or incisal, and cervical or interproximal space. Therefore, any divergence from the contact area in proximal surfaces would cause embrasures in all these directions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Facially, lingually, cervically & occlusally\"}"
