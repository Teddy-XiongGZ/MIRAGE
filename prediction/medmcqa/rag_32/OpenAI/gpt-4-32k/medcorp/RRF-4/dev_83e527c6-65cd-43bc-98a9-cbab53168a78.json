    "First, I need to understand what noncompetitive antagonism is. From Document [0], I learned that noncompetitive antagonism is exerted by a reversible agonist that combines primarily with the active agonist-receptor complex. This means that the antagonist does not compete with the agonist for the same binding site on the receptor. Instead, it binds to a different site, which changes the receptor's shape and reduces its affinity for the agonist. Next, I need to understand what Km and Vmax are. Km is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax. Vmax is the maximum rate of the reaction, which occurs when all enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate. In noncompetitive antagonism, the antagonist binds to a different site on the receptor, which changes the receptor's shape and reduces its affinity for the agonist. This means that more agonist is needed to achieve the same reaction rate, which would increase the Km value. Because the antagonist can bind even when the agonist is bound, it can reduce the maximum possible reaction rate, which would decrease the Vmax value. Therefore, the correct answer is C. V max decreased; Km value normal. Let's put this into the required format."
