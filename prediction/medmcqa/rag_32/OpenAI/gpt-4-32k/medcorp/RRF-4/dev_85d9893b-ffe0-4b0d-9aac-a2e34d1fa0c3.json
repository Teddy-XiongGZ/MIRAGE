    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of blistering and denudation involving >30% BSA along with erosions of the lips with hemorrhagic crusting and other mucosa are indicative of a severe skin condition. From the documents, it seems that these symptoms could be associated with conditions like erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Document [1] mentions that erythema multiforme can be triggered by infections and drugs, but no specific treatment is available except corticosteroids. Document [4] and [11] mention that bullous pemphigoid can be caused by genetic factors, environmental exposures to infections and drugs. Document [16] mentions that erosions on the mucous membranes and blisters on the skin usually indicate a serious adverse drug reaction, specifically referring to Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic epidermal necrolysis. Considering these documents, it seems that drug-induced reactions are a common triggering factor for these severe skin conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Drug induced\"}"
