    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thyroid storm is a severe, life-threatening condition characterized by extreme hyperthyroidism. The documents suggest that it can be triggered by several factors, including stress, infection, trauma, and certain medical treatments. Document [29] specifically mentions that abrupt discontinuation of antithyroid medicine, thyroid surgery, non-thyroid surgery, and trauma can precipitate a thyroid storm. Therefore, ineffective pre-operative hormonal control and manhandling of the thyroid gland during surgery could potentially lead to a thyroid storm. However, there is no mention of a parathyroid tail left after surgery or poor preoperative preparation of the patient being direct causes of a thyroid storm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. ineffective pre-operative hormonal control, B. manhandling of the thyroid gland during surgery\"}"
