    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The face-bow transfer is a procedure used in dentistry to record the spatial relationship between the maxillary arch and some anatomic reference point or points and then transfer this relationship to an articulator. It helps in the orientation and relation of casts in dental procedures. The question asks what must be determined before an arbitrary face bow transfer record. The arbitrary face-bow is used to record the relationship of the maxilla to some reference point(s) in the TMJ and transfer this relationship to an articulator. It does not require the determination of the physiologic rest position, inclination of each condyle, axial centre of rotation of condyle, or kinematic axis of movement of condyle. Therefore, none of the options provided are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
