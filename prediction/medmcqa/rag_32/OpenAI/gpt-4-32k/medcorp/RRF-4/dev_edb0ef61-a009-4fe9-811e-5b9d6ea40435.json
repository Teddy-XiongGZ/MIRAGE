    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ankylosis is a condition where a tooth becomes fused to the bone, preventing it from erupting. According to the documents, ankylosis can occur after autotransplantation of a tooth. However, the documents do not provide any information that directly links the chances of ankylosis to the splinting of the mandibular molar, surgical extraction of the molar, or keeping the root moist in cotton. Document [16] does mention that root configuration, occlusal form, and root canal treatment can significantly change the stress distribution on teeth and bone, which may influence the risk of ankylosis. Document [27] suggests that the success of autotransplantation and the risk of ankylosis may be related to the recipient site conditions and the surgical techniques used. Therefore, the socket preparation of the molar for autotransplantation seems to be the most relevant factor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
