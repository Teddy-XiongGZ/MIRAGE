    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The proximal segment of a mandibular angle fracture refers to the part of the mandible that is closer to the midline of the body. According to Document [17], posterior displacement of the proximal segment after IVRO showed tendency to regress its original position. This suggests that the proximal segment of a mandibular angle fracture usually displaces in a posterior direction. Document [27] also supports this, stating that preoperative evaluation of mandible fracture angulation degree is useful for determining postoperative complication rates, MMF need, and operative challenge. This finding is helpful for effective performance to reposition the fractured mandible. Therefore, the proximal segment of a mandibular angle fracture usually displaces in a posterior direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Posterior and superior\"}"
