    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several drugs used for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the question specifically asks for the drug commonly used in an outpatient department (OPD). Document [1] mentions that cefuroxime, a second-generation cephalosporin, can be used for empirical treatment of common bacterial infections seen in community especially respiratory tract infections, which includes CAP. This suggests that cefuroxime might be a common choice in an OPD setting. However, the option of cefuroxime is not provided in the choices. Among the given choices, Document [1] also mentions that ceftriaxone is recommended for the management of community-acquired pneumonia. Therefore, ceftriaxone (Choice B) seems to be the most appropriate answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
