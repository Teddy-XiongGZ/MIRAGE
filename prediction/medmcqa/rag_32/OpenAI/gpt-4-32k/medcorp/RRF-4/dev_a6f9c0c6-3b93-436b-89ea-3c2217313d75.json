    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sandy stage refers to the stage of the dough-like mixture of the acrylic resin during denture fabrication. If the resin is packed at this stage, it may not have achieved the optimal consistency for packing, which could lead to issues in the final denture. Document [8] mentions that a significantly stronger bond was obtained when the resin was packed late in the dough stage. This implies that packing the resin in the sandy stage could lead to a weaker bond, which could potentially cause distortion or porosity in the final denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Porosity\"}"
