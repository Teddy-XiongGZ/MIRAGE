    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a classification system that uses the 'canine law' malocclusion in a sagittal direction. From the documents, it is clear that the sagittal direction is often considered in malocclusion classifications. However, none of the documents mention a 'canine law'. Therefore, I need to look for a classification system that specifically considers the position of the canines in a sagittal direction. From the documents, it seems that the Simon classification was the first three-dimensional classification system, which would likely consider the sagittal direction. However, there is no specific mention of the 'canine law' in relation to the Simon classification. The Dewey classification is mentioned in relation to Class I malocclusion and the position of the canines, but again there is no mention of the 'canine law'. The Lischer's classification is not mentioned in relation to the sagittal direction or the 'canine law'. The Bonnet's classification is not mentioned in the documents at all. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, it is not possible to definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the documents\"}"
