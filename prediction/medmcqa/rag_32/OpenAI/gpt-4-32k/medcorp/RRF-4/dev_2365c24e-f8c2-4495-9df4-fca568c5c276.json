    "Step 1: Review the question and the answer choices. The question is asking for the statement that is not true about giant cell tumors. Step 2: Review each answer choice in relation to the provided documents. A. Commonly presents in the 20-40 year age group - Document [26] confirms that giant cell tumor (GCT) commonly occurs in young adults 20-40 years old. B. Matrix consists of proliferating mononuclear cells - Document [21] mentions that the lesions of GCT have a background network of mononuclear stromal cells, which suggests that the matrix does consist of proliferating mononuclear cells. C. Osteoclast giant cells constitute the proliferative component of the tumor - Document [17] states that the giant-cell tumour stromal cells (GCTSC) constitute the neoplastic cells, which are from an osteoblastic origin. The multinucleated giant cell (MNGC) fractions are secondarily recruited and comprise the non-neoplastic cell population. This suggests that the osteoclast giant cells do not constitute the proliferative component of the tumor. D. It is a benign tumor which may have lung metastasis - Document [1] mentions that about 5% of giant-cell tumors metastasize, usually to a lung. Document [19] also confirms that GCTOB has been observed to metastasize to the lungs in up to 5% of cases. Step 3: Based on the review, the statement that is not true about giant cell tumors is C. Osteoclast giant cells constitute the proliferative component of the tumor. Output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each answer choice in relation to the provided documents. I found that the statements in choices A, B, and D are confirmed by the documents. However, the statement in choice C is contradicted by the information in the documents, which state that the giant-cell tumour stromal cells constitute the neoplastic cells, not the osteoclast giant cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
