    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the percentage of mandibular incisors that have 2 root canals. Looking at the documents, Document [0] states that the prevalence of the second canal in incisors is 36.62%. Document [1] does not provide a specific percentage for incisors. Document [2] states that roots with two canals were more frequent in the incisors (14.9%, 17.2%, and 6.1% of the central incisors, lateral incisors, and canines, respectively). Document [3] states that the prevalence of 2 root canals in the lateral incisors (27.36%) was higher than that in the central incisors (15.71%). Document [8] states that the presence of a second canal in mandibular lateral teeth (35%) is more common than in mandibular central teeth (23.9 %). Document [21] states that two canals appeared in 26.3% of mandibular central incisors, 30.8% of lateral incisors, and 28.6% of all the 822 mandibular incisors. Document [23] states that the mandibular central incisors (CI) exhibited, significant difference between Type-I, II, III and IV canal configurations and Type-I, II, III and V canal configurations (p < 0.05). For the mandibular lateral incisor (LI), significant difference was found between Type-I, II, III, IV and VII canal configurations (p < 0.05). The cumulative prevalence of oval canals in mandibular incisors was found to be 46.6%. For both mandibular CI and LI, the prevalence of Type-I canals was significantly higher in males as compared to females (p < 0.05). Conversely, significantly higher prevalence of Type-III canals was noted for females as compared to males (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the prevalence of different canal configurations on the left and the right side of the mouth. Document [28] states that the mandibular central incisors exhibited, significant difference between Type-I, II, III and IV canal configurations and Type-I, II, III and V canal configurations (p < 0.05). For the mandibular lateral incisor (LI), significant difference was found between Type-I, II, III, IV and VII canal configurations (p < 0.05). The cumulative prevalence of oval canals in mandibular incisors was found to be 46.6%. For both mandibular CI and LI, the prevalence of Type-I canals was significantly higher in males as compared to females (p < 0.05). Conversely, significantly higher prevalence of Type-III canals was noted for females as compared to males (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the prevalence of different canal configurations on the left and the right side of the mouth. Based on these documents, the percentage of mandibular incisors with 2 root canals ranges from around 15% to 36%, which falls within the range of 22-40%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
