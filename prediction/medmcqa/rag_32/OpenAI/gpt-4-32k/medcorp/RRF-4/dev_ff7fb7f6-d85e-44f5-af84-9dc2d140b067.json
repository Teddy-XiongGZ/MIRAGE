    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Addison's disease is a disorder that occurs when the body produces insufficient amounts of certain hormones produced by the adrenal glands. In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands produce too little cortisol and often insufficient levels of aldosterone as well. Document [12] mentions that symptoms of Addison's disease may include fatigue, muscle weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, lightheadedness upon standing, irritability, depression, and diarrhea. Some people have cravings for salty foods due to the loss of sodium through their urine. Document [26] mentions that hyponatremia with or without hyperkalemia and/or hypotension can often be seen in Addison's disease. Document [29] mentions that in many cases, the diagnosis is made only after the patient presents with an acute adrenal crisis (hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia). However, none of the documents mention hypocalcaemia as a symptom of Addison's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
