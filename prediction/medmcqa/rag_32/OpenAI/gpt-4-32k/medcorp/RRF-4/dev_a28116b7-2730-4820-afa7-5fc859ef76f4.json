    "The middle cranial fossa and the posterior cranial fossa are two of the three distinct cranial fossae mentioned in the documents. The middle cranial fossa houses the temporal lobes of the brain and the pituitary gland (Document 2), while the posterior cranial fossa contains the brainstem and cerebellum (Document 0). The middle cranial fossa is separated from the posterior fossa by the clivus and the petrous crest (Document 0). The petrous part of the temporal bone is a critical structure in this separation (Document 15). The petrous part of the temporal bone forms the anterior surface of the posterior cranial fossa (Document 15) and the posterior boundary of the middle cranial fossa (Document 23). Therefore, the petrous part of the temporal bone is the structure that divides the lateral part of the middle cranial fossa and the posterior cranial fossa. { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The middle cranial fossa and the posterior cranial fossa are two of the three distinct cranial fossae.
