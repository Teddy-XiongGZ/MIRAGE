    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anodontia is a condition characterized by the absence of teeth. According to Document [11], the absence of teeth significantly affects the development of the maxillary and alveolar bone. Document [13] also supports this, stating that the growth of the maxilla was slightly reduced in a patient with anodontia. However, there was no detectable effect on the mandible. Document [14] also mentions that the growth of the maxilla can be affected by anodontia. Therefore, the answer should be either the maxilla or the alveolar bone. However, since the alveolar bone is part of the maxilla and mandible where the teeth are housed, and the documents specifically mention the maxilla, I will choose the maxilla as the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
