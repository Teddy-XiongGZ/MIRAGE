    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child is 10 months old and the mother is concerned about non-eruption of teeth. Normally, the first tooth erupts around 6 months of age, but it can vary widely from child to child. Some children may not have their first tooth until 12 or 14 months, which is still considered within normal limits. Therefore, at this stage, it might be too early to be concerned about non-eruption of teeth. However, to reassure the mother and to check the development of the child's teeth, an orthopantomogram (OPG) can be done. This is a panoramic scanning dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw that shows a two-dimensional view of a half-circle from ear to ear. It shows the position of the fully emerged, emerging, and impacted teeth. A PA skull view is not typically used for this purpose. A paediatric consultation might not be necessary at this stage unless there are other concerns about the child's overall development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. You will do OPG which shows developing tooth buds\"}"
