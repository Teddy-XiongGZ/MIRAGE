    "The question is asking about the number of base pairs in DNA. From Document [19], it is stated that \"The haploid human genome (23 chromosomes) is estimated to be about 3.2 billion bases long\". This means that the number of base pairs in DNA is approximately 3.2 billion. So, the answer is C. 3.2 billion. { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the number of base pairs in DNA.
