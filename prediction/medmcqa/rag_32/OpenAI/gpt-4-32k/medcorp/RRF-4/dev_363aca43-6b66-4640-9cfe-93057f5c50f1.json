    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrates are used in the treatment of angina pectoris. They work by causing vasodilation of the blood vessels, which increases the blood supply to the heart muscle. This is particularly beneficial in an acute attack of angina, where the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen due to narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. However, nitrates also have other effects such as decreasing preload, afterload, and heart rate. Preload refers to the volume of blood in the heart at the end of diastole, just before it contracts. By decreasing preload, nitrates can reduce the workload of the heart. Afterload refers to the resistance that the heart must overcome to eject blood during systole. By decreasing afterload, nitrates can make it easier for the heart to pump blood. Finally, by decreasing heart rate, nitrates can reduce the oxygen demand of the heart. However, the major mechanism of action of nitrates in an acute attack of angina is coronary vasodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
