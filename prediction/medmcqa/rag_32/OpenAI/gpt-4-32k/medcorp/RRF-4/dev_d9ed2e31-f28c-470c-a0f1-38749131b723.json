    "Step 1: Review the question and the answer choices. The question is asking for the feature of a newborn's skull that is not true. Step 2: Review the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that at birth, many regions of the newborn's skull have not yet been converted to bone, leaving \"soft spots\" known as fontanels. This indicates that the anterior fontanelle is open in a newborn, so choice C is true and can be eliminated. Step 3: Document [16] mentions that the postnatal growth from different structures would be investigated at 61 skulls of children and 87 skulls of adults. The mean distance between the Foramen caecum and the Protuberantia occipitalis interna (internal length of the skull) increases from 9.7 cm to 14.0 cm. This suggests that the skull of a newborn is not fully developed and continues to grow postnatally. This could imply that the mastoid process is not of adult size in a newborn, so choice D is likely false and could be the correct answer. Step 4: Document [27] mentions that the skull will harden and fuse through development to protect its inner contents. This could suggest that the diploe (the spongy bone in the skull) is not formed in a newborn (choice A) and the styloid process has not fused with the rest of the temporal bone (choice B). However, without specific information on these features in the documents, it's difficult to definitively eliminate these choices. Step 5: Based on the information available in the documents, the most likely answer is D. The mastoid process is not of adult size in a newborn.
