    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the statement that is not true for light cure composite. Looking at the documents, Document [28] mentions that the light curing method, including variations of time, the depth of cure, and the composite shade influence the composite microhardness. Clinicians should avoid thicker increments when working with composite restorations. This suggests that adding increments of 1-2 mm (Choice D) is a common practice and is true. Document [20] mentions that the light intensity output of LCUs has a significant influence on the cure characteristics of dental composites with both DOC and surface micro-hardness increasing with increase in light intensity up to 1500mWcm\u207b\u00b2. This suggests that the distance of the light source from the tooth (Choice A) can affect the curing process, making this statement true. Document [30] mentions that Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill produced significantly greater DOCs than TPH and Z250 (P &lt; 0.05) for all three power mode settings. This suggests that the polymerization reaction continues for a period (Choice C) which is also true. However, none of the documents mention the use of an orange glass shield for eye protection (Choice B), making this statement likely to be false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
