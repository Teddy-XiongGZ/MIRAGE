    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary survey in trauma patients is designed to quickly identify and address life-threatening injuries. It includes assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure/environment. Imaging plays a crucial role in this process. Cervical spine X-ray is usually performed to rule out cervical spine injuries. Chest and pelvic X-rays are also part of the primary survey. Hemodynamically unstable patients should not be sent for a CT scan as it may delay necessary interventions. However, the statement that all patients should have a chest X-ray-PA view only is not accurate. Both PA and lateral views are typically obtained to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the chest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
