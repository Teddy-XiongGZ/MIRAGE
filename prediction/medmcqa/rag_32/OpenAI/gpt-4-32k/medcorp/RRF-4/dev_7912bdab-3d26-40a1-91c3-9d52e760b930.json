    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the person who first proposed the concept of evidence-based medicine. From the documents, Document [5] mentions that the term 'evidence-based medicine' was introduced by Dr. Gordon Guyatt. However, he is not one of the options. Document [11] mentions that evidence-based medicine is a method that uses well-designed and well-conducted randomized controlled trials, but it does not mention who first proposed it. Document [22] also talks about evidence-based medicine but does not mention who proposed it. Document [24] mentions that evidence-based medicine is a shift in medical paradigms and about solving clinical problems, but it does not mention who first proposed it. None of the documents mention Tolstoy, Hippocrates, or da Vinci in relation to evidence-based medicine. However, Document [16] mentions that evidence-based medicine is based on the best results from clinical and epidemiological research, which is combined with clinical experience and patient preferences. This is the closest description to the concept of evidence-based medicine as we know it today, and the person associated with this description in the document is Sackett.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Sackett\"}"
