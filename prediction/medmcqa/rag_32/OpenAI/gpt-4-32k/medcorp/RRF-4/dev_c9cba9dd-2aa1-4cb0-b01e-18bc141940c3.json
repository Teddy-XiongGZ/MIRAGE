    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stiffness is a term used to describe the force needed to achieve a certain deformation of a structure. It is the extent to which an object resists deformation in response to an applied force. This is clearly stated in Document [0] and Document [2]. Therefore, stiffness is not the degree of deformation, but the resistance to it. Also, the term 'elastic deformation' is used, which means the object can return to its original shape after the force is removed, unlike 'plastic deformation' where the object cannot return to its original shape.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
