    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of tingling sensation in the lower limb suggest peripheral neuropathy. According to Document [0], peripheral neuropathy is a major concern as a side effect of anti-tubercular drugs. The document also mentions that despite drug withdrawal, the patient did not improve significantly, indicating that the neuropathy might be irreversible. However, it does not provide information on the treatment of this condition. Document [10] mentions that isoniazid-induced polyneuropathy was a common occurrence when this drug was first used for the treatment of tuberculosis. The symptoms of neuropathy appeared between 3 and 35 weeks after treatment was begun. However, it does not provide information on the treatment of this condition. Document [20] mentions that peripheral neuropathy was encountered in 13% of their cohort of MDR-TB patients. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy can be based on clinical presentation alone, and effective management of this side-effect is possible without sacrificing MDR-TB treatment efficacy. However, it does not provide information on the treatment of this condition. Document [24] mentions that for distal symmetric polyneuropathy that fails to resolve following the discontinuation of dideoxynucleosides, therapy is symptomatic; gabapentin, carbamazepine, tricyclics. However, it does not provide information on the treatment of this condition. Therefore, none of the documents provide a clear answer to the question. However, it is known that pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is often used to prevent or treat peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving isoniazid. Therefore, the answer is likely to be pyridoxine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
