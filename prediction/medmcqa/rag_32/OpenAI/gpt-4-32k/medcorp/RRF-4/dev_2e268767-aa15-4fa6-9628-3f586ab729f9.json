    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, the Couinaud classification of liver anatomy divides the liver into eight functionally independent segments. Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. In the centre of each segment there is a branch of the portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct. Therefore, all three structures (portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct) are involved in differentiating the segments anatomically. However, the question asks for one structure, so I need to choose the most significant one. The portal vein is particularly emphasized in the documents as a key structure in defining the segments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Portal vein\"}"
