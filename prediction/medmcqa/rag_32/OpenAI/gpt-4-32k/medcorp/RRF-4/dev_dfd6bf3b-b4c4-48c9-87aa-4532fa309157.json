    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include headache, vomiting, decreased movement in the right leg, violent and aggressive behavior, and abdominal pain. Document [23] describes a patient with mental retardation who experienced severe vomiting and abdominal pain due to autoaggressive behavior, which aligns with the patient's violent and aggressive behavior and abdominal pain. However, this document does not mention headache or decreased movement in the right leg. Document [30] describes a case of a brainstem glioma presenting with hemi-chorea, which could potentially explain the decreased movement in the right leg, but this does not align with the other symptoms. Document [5] discusses abdominal epilepsy and migraine as potential causes of recurrent abdominal pain, which could potentially explain the abdominal pain and headache, but not the other symptoms. Document [4] describes a pregnant patient with severe abdominal pain, but this does not align with the other symptoms. None of the documents seem to perfectly align with all of the patient's symptoms. However, considering the combination of neurological symptoms (headache, decreased movement in the right leg), gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting), and psychiatric symptoms (violent and aggressive behavior), the most probable diagnosis could be Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP). AIP is a genetic disorder affecting the production of heme, a component of hemoglobin. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, neurological symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Acute intermittent porphyria\"}"
