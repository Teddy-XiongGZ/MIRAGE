    "Step 1: Review each statement in the context of the provided documents. Step 2: Statement A - \"B. fragilis is the most frequent anaerobe isolated from clinical samples\". This statement is supported by Document [0], [2], [4], [6], [7], [8], [11], [15], [20], [22], [24], [26], [28], [30], and [31]. Step 3: Statement B - \"B. fragilis is sensitive to metronidazole\". Document [22] confirms that metronidazole is active against more than 99% of clinical isolates of Bacteroides, which supports this statement. Step 4: Statement C - \"The lipopolysaccharide formed by B. fragilis is structurally & functionally different from conventional endotoxin\". Document [0] states that B. fragilis has an altered LPS and does not cause endotoxic shock, which supports this statement. Step 5: Statement D - \"Shock & DIC are common in Bacteroides bacteremia\". Document [0] states that B. fragilis does not cause endotoxic shock, which contradicts this statement. Based on the above analysis, the statement \"Shock & DIC are common in Bacteroides bacteremia\" is not supported by the provided documents and is therefore likely to be false. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each statement in the context of the provided documents. Statements A, B, and C are supported by the documents, while statement D is contradicted by the information in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
