    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) is calculated as the number of live births in a year per 1000 people. In this case, the CBR is 20, which means there are 20 live births per 1000 people in a year. However, the question asks for the number of pregnant women registered in a sub-center, which is not directly provided by the CBR. The documents provided do not give information on the relationship between the CBR and the number of pregnant women registered in a sub-center. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center based on the given CBR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
