    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that most medicines specify storage at 25 degrees C or less. This means that the temperature should not exceed 25 degrees C. Therefore, the options that exceed this temperature can be eliminated. The remaining options are 2-8 degrees C and 0 degrees C. However, 0 degrees C might be too cold for some medicines, as freezing could potentially harm them. Therefore, the range of 2-8 degrees C seems to be the most appropriate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
