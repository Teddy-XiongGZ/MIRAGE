    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the incidence of extra canals in mandibular first molars. Document [2] states that the incidence of middle mesial (MM) canals in mandibular first and second molars was 20%. Document [4] states that the incidence of middle mesial canals (MMCs) of mandibular first permanent molars was 5.67%. Document [8] states that the overall prevalence of MMCs in the mandibular first molars was 8.1%. Document [25] states that the occurrence of four root canals in the mandibular first molar of a Saudi Arabian subpopulation was high, but it does not provide a specific percentage. Document [27] states that 25.26% of PMSMs had three canals and 73.31% had four canals. However, this is not specific to extra canals. Considering these documents, the closest answer would be 20%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
