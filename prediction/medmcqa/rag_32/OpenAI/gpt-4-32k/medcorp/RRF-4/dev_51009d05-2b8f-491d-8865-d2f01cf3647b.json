    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reverse bevel incision is a surgical technique used in various medical procedures. According to Document [3], a reverse bevel incision is made using a scalpel and is guided by pre-operative planning. This incision is based on the amount of tooth structure to be exposed. The beveling incision also should follow a scalloped outline, to ensure maximal interproximal coverage of the alveolar bone when the flap subsequently is repositioned. This suggests that the reverse bevel incision provides access to the alveolar crest. However, the document does not mention anything about removing infected tissue in the sulcus or allowing atraumatic reflection of the gingival margin. Therefore, the answer is C. Provide access to the alveolar crest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
