    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a known case of thalassemia major and is on repeated blood transfusions. She has a history of iron overload and cardiac arrhythmia. During the blood transfusion, she complained of backache and appears extremely anxious. These symptoms could indicate a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is a known complication in thalassemia patients receiving blood transfusions. This reaction can cause symptoms like fever, pain at the infusion site, and anxiety. Therefore, the blood transfusion should be stopped immediately to prevent further complications. An ECG should be done to assess the patient's cardiac status given her history of arrhythmia. A clerical check, which involves rechecking the patient's blood group and the blood bag details, should also be done to rule out any errors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
