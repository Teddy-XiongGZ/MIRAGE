    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the appearance of a maxillary premolar root in a radiograph. If the facial root appears distal to the palatal root, it means that the x-ray beam was directed from the mesial side of the tooth. This is because the x-ray beam would have passed through the facial root before the palatal root, making the facial root appear distal (or behind) the palatal root in the radiograph.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. From mesial side of the tooth\"}"
