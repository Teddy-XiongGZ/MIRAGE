    "First, I will review the documents to find information about the WHO 2016 classification of Acute leukemia and the provisional entities it includes. Document [1] mentions that the WHO classification was updated in 2016 to include new biomarkers and suggests new entities, but it does not specify what these entities are. Document [2] refers to Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) as a group of diseases in the 2016 WHO classification, but it does not mention if it is a provisional entity. Document [15] mentions that the WHO 2017 classification of precursor lymphoid neoplasm includes B-ALL/LBL not otherwise specified (NOS); B-ALL/LBL with recurrent genetic abnormalities; T-ALL/LBL; and NK-ALL/LBL, but it does not specify if these are provisional entities. Document [22] mentions the International Consensus Classification (ICC) of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) includes revisions to subtypes previously outlined in the 2016 WHO classification and several newly described entities, but it does not specify if these are provisional entities. Document [29] mentions that the 2016 WHO Classification of AML will continually be revised and updated in future versions based on advances, but it does not specify the provisional entities. After reviewing all the documents, I found that none of them provide specific information about the provisional entities in the WHO 2016 classification of Acute leukemia. Therefore, I am unable to determine which of the provided options is not a provisional entity as per the WHO 2016 classification of Acute leukemia. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed all the documents to find information about the WHO 2016 classification of Acute leukemia and the provisional entities it includes.
