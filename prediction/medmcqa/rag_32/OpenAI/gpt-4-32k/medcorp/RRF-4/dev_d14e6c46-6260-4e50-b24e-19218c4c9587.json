    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of tingling sensation in the limbs suggest peripheral neuropathy. Document [3] mentions that peripheral neuropathy is a major concern in patients undergoing anti-tubercular therapy and that it tends to be severe and usually irreversible. The document also lists several anti-tubercular drugs that may contribute to peripheral neuropathy, including INH, ethambutol, linezolid, cycloserine, and para-amino salicylic acid. Document [6] specifically mentions that isoniazid (INH)-induced polyneuropathy was a common occurrence when this drug was first used for the treatment of tuberculosis. The initial symptoms of this neuropathy are symmetrical numbness and tingling of the toes and feet. This suggests that the patient's symptoms may be a side effect of the anti-tubercular therapy. Among the options provided, Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is known to be used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, substituting Pyridoxine might result in improvement of symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pyridoxine\"}"
