    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each type of cyst is and how it relates to vital teeth. A dentigerous cyst is associated with the crown of an unerupted or impacted tooth, but it doesn't specify if it's associated with vital teeth. A periapical cyst occurs through an inflammatory process from non-vital teeth, so it's not associated with vital teeth. A lateral periodontal cyst is asymptomatic and usually exposed in patients' routine radiography. Adjacent teeth vitality is of great importance when contemplating a pre-surgical working diagnosis of lateral periodontal cyst. Therefore, the lateral periodontal cyst is the most common cyst associated with adjoining vital teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lateral periodontal cyst\"}"
