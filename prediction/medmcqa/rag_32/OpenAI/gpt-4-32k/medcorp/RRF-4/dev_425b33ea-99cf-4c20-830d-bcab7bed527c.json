    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [2] mentions that the markers most widely used in detection of MI are MB subtype of the enzyme creatine kinase and cardiac troponins T and I. This means that CPK-MB is elevated in MI. Document [20] mentions that aspartate aminotransferase (AST), also known as SGOT, is highly sensitive and specific for acute injury to the heart, particularly acute myocardial infarction. This means that SGOT (AST) is elevated in MI. Document [6] also mentions that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme 1 in serum is highly sensitive and specific for acute injury to the heart, particularly acute myocardial infarction. This means that LDH is elevated in MI. Therefore, all of the enzymes mentioned in the options are elevated in MI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
