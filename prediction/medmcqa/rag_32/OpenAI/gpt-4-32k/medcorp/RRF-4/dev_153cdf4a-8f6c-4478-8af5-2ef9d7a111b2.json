    "Based on the documents, periodontal surgery is typically performed after non-surgical therapy and on patients who show excellent plaque control (Document [5]). This suggests that the surgery should be performed after the completion of the hygienic phase, which involves non-surgical periodontal therapy such as plaque removal and control, scaling, and root surface debridement (Document [14]). However, the documents do not specify the exact time frame after the completion of the hygienic phase. Therefore, the answer choice should be the one that suggests performing the surgery after the completion of the hygienic phase. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontal surgery is typically performed after non-surgical therapy and on patients who show excellent plaque control.
