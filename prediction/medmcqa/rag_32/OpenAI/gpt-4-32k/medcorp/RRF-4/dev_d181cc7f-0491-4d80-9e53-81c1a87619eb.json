    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microalbuminuria is defined as a urinary albumin excretion rate of 20-200 micrograms/min, equal to 30-300 mg/24 h, which is below the proteinuric range (Document 1). This is not exactly the same as the range provided in option A, which states 20 mg/d to 200 mg/d. Therefore, option A is not entirely accurate. Microalbuminuria is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity in diabetic patients (Document 4), so option B is correct. Microalbuminuria is also the earliest marker of diabetic nephropathy (Document 4), so option C is correct. Lastly, microalbuminuria is not detected by routine dipstick method (Document 16), so option D is also correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B, C, D\"}"
