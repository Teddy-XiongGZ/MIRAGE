    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the joints, including the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). According to the documents, RA often results in cartilage and bone erosion, leading to the erosion of two opposing bones. This can lead to severe deformity if not treated. The documents also mention that TMJ involvement in RA often occurs within 2 years following general symptom onset. Pain-related dysfunction and structural changes develop with time. This makes early (clinical) recognition of pain and inflammation important, enabling early treatment to minimize later irreversible damage. Among the options provided, osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that can occur as a result of wear and tear, including the wear and tear caused by RA. Ankylosis, synovial chondromatosis, and subluxation are not mentioned as common complications of RA in the TMJ in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Osteoarthritis\"}"
