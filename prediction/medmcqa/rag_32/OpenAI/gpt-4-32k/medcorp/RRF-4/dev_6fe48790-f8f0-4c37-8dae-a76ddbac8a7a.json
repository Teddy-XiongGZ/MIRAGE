    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, also known as hyperchloremic acidosis, is characterized by a decrease in bicarbonate (HCO3-) and an increase in chloride (Cl-), which maintains the anion gap within the normal range. This type of acidosis is typically caused by either increased production of chloride or increased excretion of bicarbonate. Common causes include severe diarrhea, renal tubular acidosis, and long-term use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Salicylate poisoning, on the other hand, is a common cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, not normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. This is because salicylates can lead to the production of organic acids, which are unmeasured anions that increase the anion gap.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
