    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is a hormone that rapidly counters the metabolic effects of insulin in the liver, causing glycogenolysis and release of glucose into the blood. It is used to treat hypoglycemia caused by insulin excess. However, in the case of Nesidioblastosis, which is a condition characterized by hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia due to the presence of too many insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, glucagon might not be effective. This is because the excess insulin in the body could counteract the effects of glucagon, making it less effective in raising blood glucose levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Nesidioblastosis\"}"
