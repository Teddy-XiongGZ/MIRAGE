    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what twinning is. From the documents, I understand that twinning is a type of deformation in the crystal lattice of a metal. Now, I need to find out which of the given metals show this property. Document 16 mentions that twinning is a property of a metal that refers to a movement that divides lattice into two symmetric parts and that deformation in certain structures occurs by twinning. It also mentions that the nickel-titanium alloys are characterized by multiple, rather than single, twinning. Therefore, nickel-titanium alloy shows the property of twinning. However, none of the documents mention that stainless steel or cobalt chromium show the property of twinning. Therefore, the answer is B. Nickel-titanium alloy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
