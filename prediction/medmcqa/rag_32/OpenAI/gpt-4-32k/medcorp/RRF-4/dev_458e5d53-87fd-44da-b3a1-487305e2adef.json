    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a child with a large stone in the renal pelvis, presenting with abdominal colic and hematuria. The stone is too large for conservative management or to pass spontaneously. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive treatment for urinary stones, but it may not be effective for larger stones, and it's not usually the first choice for pediatric patients due to the need for anesthesia and potential for multiple treatments. Pyelolithotomy is a surgical procedure to remove stones from the renal pelvis and is often used for larger stones. Nephroureterostomy is a procedure to drain the kidney and is not typically used for stone removal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Pyelolithotomy\"}"
