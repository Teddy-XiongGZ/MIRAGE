    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The earliest diagnosis of pregnancy can be established by detecting the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood or urine, as mentioned in Document [2]. This hormone is produced by the placenta after implantation. The levels of hCG can be detected as early as ten days after nidation. Ultrasound and MRI are imaging techniques that can be used later in pregnancy to monitor fetal development and detect any complications. However, they are not the first-line methods for diagnosing pregnancy. Fetal cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound, but this is usually not until six to eight weeks of gestation, as stated in Document [14]. Doppler studies are typically not used in early pregnancy due to theoretical risks to the fetus, as mentioned in Document [0]. MRI is not typically used in early pregnancy due to concerns about radiation exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
