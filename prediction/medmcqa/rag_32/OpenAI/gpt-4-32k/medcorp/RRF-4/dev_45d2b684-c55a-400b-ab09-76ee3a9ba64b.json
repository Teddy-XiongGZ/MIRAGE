    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what disto-angular impaction of the mandibular 3rd molar is. From the documents, I learned that it's a type of tooth impaction where the tooth is angled backwards, towards the rear of the mouth. Now, I need to find out what complications can arise from the extraction of such a tooth. Document [0] mentions that trismus, or limited mouth opening, can occur postoperatively, especially when the procedure exceeds 30 minutes. However, this is not one of the answer choices. Document [4] mentions that mandibular fractures can occur postoperatively, especially in cases of deeply impacted lower third molars. This seems to align with choice B, '# of ramus of mandible', assuming that '#' stands for 'fracture'. The other documents do not provide information relevant to the answer choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
