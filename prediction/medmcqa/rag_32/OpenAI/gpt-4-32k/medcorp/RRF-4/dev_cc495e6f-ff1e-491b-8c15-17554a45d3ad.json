    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a rotator cuff muscle that has been less studied or 'forgotten'. Looking at the documents, there is no specific mention of a 'forgotten' muscle. However, the documents do provide information about the roles of each of the four rotator cuff muscles. The supraspinatus is mentioned frequently in the context of abduction of the humerus and is the most frequently torn rotator cuff muscle. The infraspinatus is also mentioned frequently, particularly in the context of lateral or external rotation of the shoulder. The subscapularis is mentioned in the context of medial or internal rotation of the shoulder. The teres minor is mentioned less frequently than the other three muscles, and its role is described as aiding in lateral or external rotation of the arm at the shoulder. Given this information, it seems that the teres minor might be the 'forgotten' muscle, as it is mentioned less frequently and its role seems to be less emphasized than the other muscles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Teres minor\"}"
