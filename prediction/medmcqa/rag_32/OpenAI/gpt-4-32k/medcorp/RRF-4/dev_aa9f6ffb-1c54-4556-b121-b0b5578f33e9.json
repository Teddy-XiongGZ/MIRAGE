    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several times that chest X-rays are used to determine the position of pacemaker leads and to identify any malposition or displacement. For example, Document 2 mentions the radiographic aspects of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, including electrode malposition and migration. Document 5 also mentions that chest X-ray is the imaging technique of choice for an initial study of pacemakers and implantable cardio-defibrillators. Document 6 also mentions that the radiographic appearances of pacemakers can be used to identify complications such as lead malpositioning, displacement, or fracture. Therefore, the answer is X-ray.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
