    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by certain criteria. According to Document [5], the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diagnosing the accelerated phase of CML include: persistent or increasing high white blood cell count, persistent or increasing splenomegaly unresponsive to therapy, persistent thrombocytosis unresponsive to therapy, and 10-19% blasts in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow.
