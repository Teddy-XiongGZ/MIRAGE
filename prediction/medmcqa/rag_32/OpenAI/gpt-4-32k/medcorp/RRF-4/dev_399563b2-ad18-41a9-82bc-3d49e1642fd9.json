    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cyanide poisoning occurs when it binds to the ferric ion of cytochrome oxidase, an enzyme involved in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. This effectively halts cellular respiration by blocking the reduction of oxygen to water, as mentioned in Document 30. The citric acid cycle is a part of this cellular respiration process. However, cyanide does not directly block aconitase, acetyl-CoA production, citrate, or NAO in the citric acid cycle. It acts on the cytochrome oxidase in the electron transport chain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. NAO\"}"
