    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetylcholine release from the presynaptic membrane is a process that is triggered by the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal. This happens when an action potential travels down the axon, causing voltage-gated calcium channels to open. Therefore, blocking these channels would actually decrease the release of acetylcholine, not increase it. Sodium, potassium, and chloride channels are also involved in the propagation of action potentials, but they do not directly trigger the release of acetylcholine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Blocking voltage gated Ca+ channels on presynaptic membrane\"}"
