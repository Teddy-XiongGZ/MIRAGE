    "Based on Document [0], erythroblastosis fetalis is a severe hemolytic disease in the newborn that originates in utero because of a maternal-fetal blood incompatibility. The document mentions dental findings but does not specify what these are. Document [19] discusses a patient with erythroblastosis fetalis presenting with hypoplasia of enamel, which refers to underdeveloped or incomplete enamel. Document [21] discusses a case of intrinsically pigmented green teeth due to erythroblastosis fetalis. However, none of the documents mention dentinal dysplasia in relation to erythroblastosis fetalis. Therefore, the answer should be B. Hypoplastic teeth and C. Pigmented teeth.
