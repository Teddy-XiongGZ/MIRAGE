    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adrenaline and insulin are peptide hormones, which usually bind to cell surface receptors, not intracellular receptors. FSH is a glycoprotein hormone, which also binds to cell surface receptors. Thyroxine, on the other hand, is a thyroid hormone, which is known to bind to intracellular receptors, specifically nuclear receptors. Therefore, if the receptor of hormone X is found in the nucleus, it is likely that X is thyroxine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
