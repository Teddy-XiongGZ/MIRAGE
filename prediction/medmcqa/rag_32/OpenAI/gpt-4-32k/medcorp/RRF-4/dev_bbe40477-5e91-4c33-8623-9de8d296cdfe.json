    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 4th generation apex locators are mentioned in several documents. Document [12] mentions that the fourth generation of apex locators is a diverse group: some use multifrequency currents, others use a 'lookup matrix' rather than calculate the readings. Document [22] also mentions that the fourth generation of apex locators use alternating current of two frequencies and measure and compare two electrical impedances that change as the file moves apically. This suggests that they are based on multiple frequency ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Multiple frequency ratio based\"}"
