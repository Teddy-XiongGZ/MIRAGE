    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several tooth numbering systems, including the Universal system, the Palmer/Zsigmondy system, and the FDI system. The FDI system is mentioned as the most commonly used system worldwide, except in the United States where the Universal system is widely used, and in the United Kingdom where the Palmer notation is used. However, the question asks about the most commonly used system in books, not in practice. The documents do not provide specific information about which system is most commonly used in books. However, given that the FDI system is the most widely used system worldwide and is used by the World Health Organization, it is reasonable to assume that it is also the most commonly used system in books.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. FDI\"}"
