    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nasal antrostomy is a surgical procedure performed to treat sinusitis. The procedure involves creating an opening in the nasal cavity to allow for drainage and ventilation of the sinuses. The location of this opening can vary, but it is typically done through the middle meatus or the inferior meatus. The middle meatus is the space between the middle and inferior nasal conchae, while the inferior meatus is the space below the inferior nasal concha. According to the documents, both the middle meatus and the inferior meatus are common sites for nasal antrostomy. However, the middle meatus is often preferred due to its more physiological location, as it includes the natural ostium of the maxillary sinus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Middle meatus\"}"
