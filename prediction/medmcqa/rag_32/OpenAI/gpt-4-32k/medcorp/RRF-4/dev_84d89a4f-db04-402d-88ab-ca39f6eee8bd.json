    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The respiratory rhythm generation center is responsible for the automatic generation of the breathing rhythm. According to Document [0], the respiratory rate is set in the respiratory center by the dorsal respiratory group, in the medulla. However, Document [1] and Document [3] mention that the pre-Botzinger complex is widely accepted as the site necessary and sufficient for generation of the inspiratory phase of the respiratory rhythm. Document [23] also supports this by stating that the pre-Botzinger complex is responsible for generating the wide variety of components that make up the respiratory rhythm. Therefore, the pre-Botzinger complex seems to be the most accurate answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
