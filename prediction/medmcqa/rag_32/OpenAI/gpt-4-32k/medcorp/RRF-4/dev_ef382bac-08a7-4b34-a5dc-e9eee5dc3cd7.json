    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] mentions that the effect of isosorbide 5-mononitrate lasts longer than isosorbide dinitrate. Document [3] also mentions that there was no significant difference in treadmill walking time during acute and sustained therapy with isosorbide-5-mononitrate indicating a lack of tolerance. Document [10] also mentions that isosorbide mononitrate has a rapid onset of action and has been shown to be clinically efficient and, in addition, to be more so than conventional ISMN / ISDN. Nitrate tolerance with continued use of the formulation has not yet been reported. Therefore, both options A and C seem to be correct. However, the question asks for the 'preferred' reason, which would likely be the one that provides the most significant benefit to patients. In this case, a longer duration of action would likely be more beneficial to patients as it would require less frequent dosing and provide more consistent relief from symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
