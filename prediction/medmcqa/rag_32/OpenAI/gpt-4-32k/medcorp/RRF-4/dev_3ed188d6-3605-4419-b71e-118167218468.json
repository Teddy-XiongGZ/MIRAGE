    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop as a complication of inadequately treated strep throat or scarlet fever, which are caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus bacteria. It can cause long-term damage to the heart, including damaged heart valves and heart failure. The documents mention that mitral regurgitation is the most common valvular lesion in acute rheumatic fever. Mitral regurgitation is a condition in which the heart's mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in the heart. This commonly occurs before other types of valvular lesions such as aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, or aortic stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
