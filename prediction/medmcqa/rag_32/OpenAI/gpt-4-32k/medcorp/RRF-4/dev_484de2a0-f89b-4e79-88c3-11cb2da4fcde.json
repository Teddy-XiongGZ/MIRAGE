    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of the times. This is a statistics question and it is related to the concept of a confidence interval. In a normal distribution, 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, to find the lower limit of the average IOP, we subtract 2 standard deviations from the mean. The mean is given as 30 mmHg and the standard deviation is 1.0 mmHg. Therefore, the lower limit of the average IOP is 30 - 2*1 = 28 mmHg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
