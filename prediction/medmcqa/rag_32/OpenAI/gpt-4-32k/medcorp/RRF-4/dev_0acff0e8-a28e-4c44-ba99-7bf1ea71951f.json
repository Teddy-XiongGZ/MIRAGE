    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"From the documents, it is clear that chicken pox infection in the mother can have different impacts on the baby depending on the timing of the infection during pregnancy. Document [24] mentions that the dangers to the fetus associated with a primary VZV infection are greater in the first six months. However, Document [7] and Document [19] highlight that life-threatening disseminated neonatal varicella must be expected if the mother develops chicken pox between 5 days before and 2 days after delivery. This suggests that the most dangerous period for the baby is when the mother contracts chicken pox very close to the time of delivery, which typically occurs around 37-40 weeks of gestation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 28-37weeks\"}"
