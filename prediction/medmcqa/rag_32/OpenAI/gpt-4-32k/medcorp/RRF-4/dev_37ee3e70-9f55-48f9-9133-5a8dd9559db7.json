    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha thalassemia is a form of thalassemia involving the genes HBA1 and HBA2. In alpha-thalassemia, there is a decrease in the amount of alpha chains, resulting in fewer normal hemoglobin molecules. This leads to the production of unstable beta globin molecules which cause increased red blood cell destruction. Therefore, in alpha thalassemia, there is not an excess of alpha chains, but rather a deficiency. This deficiency in alpha chains leads to an excess of beta chains.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Excess beta chain\"}"
