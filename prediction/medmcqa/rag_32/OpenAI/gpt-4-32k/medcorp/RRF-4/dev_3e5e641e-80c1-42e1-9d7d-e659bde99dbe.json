    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the rapid source of energy for exercising muscles. Document [1] mentions that the most rapid source of energy is the Phosphocreatine (PCr) system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen is required for the resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phosphocreatine\"}"
