    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The submandibular gland is divided into a superficial and deep part. To find out which muscle is responsible for this division, I need to look at the documents that mention the submandibular gland and its structure. Document [0] and Document [1] both mention that the submandibular gland is divided into superficial and deep lobes by the mylohyoid muscle. Therefore, the mylohyoid muscle is the one that divides the submandibular gland into a superficial and deep part.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mylohyoid\"}"
