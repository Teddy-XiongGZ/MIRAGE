    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Staghorn calculi are large kidney stones that occupy a significant portion of the renal pelvis and calices. The treatment of choice for staghorn calculi is typically percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), as it allows for the removal of the entire stone and has a high success rate. However, the presence of hydronephrosis can complicate the treatment decision. Mild hydronephrosis may not significantly impact the choice of treatment. Document [3] suggests that the absence of staghorn calculi and a no or mild hydronephrosis were related to an increased risk of post-percutaneous nephrolithotomy severe bleeding complications. However, this risk is associated with severe bleeding complications, not the overall success of the procedure. Therefore, PCNL could still be considered the treatment of choice in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. PCNL\"}"
