    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity is a measure of the stiffness or rigidity of a material. According to Document [0], stainless steel wires have a higher modulus of elasticity compared to wires of nickel-titanium and beta titanium alloys. Document [8] also states that among all the wires compared, Nitinol (NiTi) showed the lowest elastic modulus. Therefore, the orthodontic wire with the least modulus of elasticity is NiTi.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
