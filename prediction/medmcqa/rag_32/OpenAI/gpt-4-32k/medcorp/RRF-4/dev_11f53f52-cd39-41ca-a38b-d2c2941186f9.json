    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cephalometric analysis involves the study of relationships between bony and soft tissue landmarks. Superimposition is a method used in cephalometric analysis to visualize growth changes. According to the documents, superimposition is traditionally done on cranial landmarks. The Structural Method, a common method of superimposition, divides superimposition into three categories: Cranial base superimposition, maxillary superimposition, and mandibular superimposition. The Sella-Nasion plane is a part of the cranial base, which is a common area for superimposition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
