    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The forces acting on the abutment tooth through a fixed partial denture should ideally be directed along the long axis of the teeth. This is because the teeth and their supporting structures are designed to withstand forces that are directed along their long axis. Forces that are directed at right angles or obliquely to the long axis of the teeth can lead to harmful stresses and potential damage to the teeth and their supporting structures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
