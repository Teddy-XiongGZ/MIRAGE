    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FNAC is a diagnostic tool used for various types of lesions, including thyroid nodules. However, it has limitations in diagnosing certain types of thyroid carcinomas. According to Document [0], FNAC can be challenging in diagnosing thyroid follicular adenoma and carcinoma due to overlapping cytomorphologic features. Document [7] also mentions that FNAC has a lower efficacy in predicting invasion when only in situ carcinoma is detected. Document [23] states that FNAC cannot reliably predict invasion in a malignant aspirate. Document [29] also mentions that FNAC is not able to detect certain tumors. Based on these documents, it seems that FNAC might have limitations in diagnosing follicular carcinoma of the thyroid, which often requires the detection of invasion to differentiate it from a benign follicular adenoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
