    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adrenaline is commonly used in surgeries to control bleeding. However, it can have side effects. According to Document [16], local infiltration of low-dosage adrenaline can cause temporary significant hemodynamic changes, particularly a marked decrease in blood pressure. Document [17] also mentions that systemic absorption of locally injected vasoconstrictors like adrenaline occurs, causing temporary hypotension and other hemodynamic changes. Document [18] reports a case where a young male died because of intraventricular bleeding caused by adrenaline infiltration during rhinoplasty. Therefore, a drastic fall in blood pressure is a possible side effect of using adrenaline to control bleeding during surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
