    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [0] states that cGMP mediates smooth muscle relaxation. Document [1] also mentions that NO primarily uses cGMP for cellular effects. Document [3] further supports this by stating that NO activates guanylate cyclase, which induces smooth muscle relaxation by increasing intracellular cGMP. Therefore, the second messenger for smooth muscle relaxation mediated by NO is cGMP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
