    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heparin is an anticoagulant drug that works by binding to the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin III, causing a conformational change that results in its activation. The activated antithrombin III then inactivates thrombin, factor Xa and other proteases. By inactivating thrombin, it blocks the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which prevents the formation of clots and prolongs the clotting time of blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
