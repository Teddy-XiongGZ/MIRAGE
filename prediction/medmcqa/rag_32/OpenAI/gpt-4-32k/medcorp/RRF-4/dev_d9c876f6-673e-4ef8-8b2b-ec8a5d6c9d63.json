    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a stable, non-pulsatile retroperitoneal hematoma on the right side, which suggests a possible kidney injury. The one-shot IVU shows a barely discernible nephrogram on the right side, which further supports the suspicion of a kidney injury. However, the patient is stable and the hematoma is contained, which means there is no active bleeding. Therefore, an immediate nephrectomy (option A) or exploration of the kidney (option B) may not be necessary and could potentially cause more harm. On-table retrograde pyelography (option C) could help to further evaluate the extent of the kidney injury, but it may not provide information about possible vascular injuries. On-table angiography (option D), on the other hand, could provide information about both the renal parenchyma and the renal vessels, which would be useful for determining the appropriate treatment plan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
