    "Step 1: Review the documents for information about the Carey Coombs murmur. Step 2: Document [0] provides a detailed description of the Carey Coombs murmur. It states that it is a mid-diastolic murmur seen in patients with mitral valvulitis due to acute rheumatic fever. It is also mentioned that it is associated with an S3 gallop rhythm and is caused by increased blood flow across a thickened mitral valve. Step 3: Compare the information from the documents with the answer choices. Step 4: Choice A, \"Delayed diastole murmur,\" is incorrect because the Carey Coombs murmur is described as a mid-diastolic murmur, not a delayed diastolic murmur. Step 5: Choice B, \"Seen in rheumatic fever,\" is correct as per the information in Document [0]. Step 6: Choice C, \"Can be associated with AR,\" is not mentioned in the documents. AR typically refers to aortic regurgitation, which is not mentioned in relation to the Carey Coombs murmur. Step 7: Choice D, \"Low pitched murmur,\" is not directly mentioned in the documents. However, the murmur is described as a \"rumble,\" which could be interpreted as a low-pitched sound. Based on the above analysis, the false statement about the Carey Coombs murmur is Choice A, \"Delayed diastole murmur.\" Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first reviewed the documents for information about the Carey Coombs murmur. Document [0] provided a detailed description of the murmur, stating that it is a mid-diastolic murmur seen in patients with mitral valvulitis due to acute rheumatic fever.
