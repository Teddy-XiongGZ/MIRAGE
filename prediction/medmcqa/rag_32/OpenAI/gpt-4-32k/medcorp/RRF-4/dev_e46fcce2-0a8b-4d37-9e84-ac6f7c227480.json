    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chromium is mentioned in several documents as a component of stainless steel. Document [0] mentions that chromium in stainless steel hardens it and makes it resistant to corrosion. Document [3] also mentions that the presence of chromium in the alloy forms a passive film that protects the underlying material from corrosion attack. Document [4] mentions that chromium is valued for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. Document [19] mentions that stainless steel is considered stainless because it has at least 11% chromium by mass, which makes it relatively inert and does not rust or react as easily as plain carbon steel. Therefore, it seems that chromium is used in stainless steel primarily for its corrosion resistance and to increase the hardness of the steel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Corrosion resistance\"}"
