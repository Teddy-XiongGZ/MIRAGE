    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the preferred IV cannula for a young patient who needs to be transfused with large amounts of fluids due to massive hemorrhage. From the documents, it is clear that the size of the cannula matters when it comes to the rate of fluid transfusion. Document [4] mentions that an 18 gauge or larger IV access is preferred for blood transfusion. Document [5] mentions that in adults, sizes 18G to 22G are normally used. Document [13] mentions that a large cannula may require a fast initial infusion rate to ensure that the drug begins to act quickly. However, none of the documents directly link the color of the cannula to its size or the rate of fluid transfusion. Therefore, additional information about the color coding of cannula sizes is needed to answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not provided in the documents\"}"
