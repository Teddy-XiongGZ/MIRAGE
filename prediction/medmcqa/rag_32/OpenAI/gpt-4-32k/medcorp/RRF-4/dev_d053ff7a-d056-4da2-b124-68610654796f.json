    "The relevant document for this question is Document [12] which states: \"Movements of the mandible include depression, elevation, protrusion, and retraction (Fig. 8.140): Depression is generated by the digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles on both sides, is normally assisted by gravity, and, because it involves forward movement of the head of the mandible onto the articular tubercle, the lateral pterygoid muscles are also involved.\" From this information, it is clear that the depression of the mandible is achieved by the digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles, as well as the lateral pterygoid muscles. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document clearly states that the depression of the mandible is achieved by the digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles, as well as the lateral pterygoid muscles. Therefore, all the options listed are involved in the depression of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
