    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Evasive and dawdling behavior in a child could be a response to various types of maternal behavior. However, considering the options provided, an overprotective mother might lead to a child developing evasive behavior as a way to seek independence or avoid excessive control. An authoritarian mother might also lead to such behavior as the child might try to resist or avoid the strict rules and high expectations. A rejecting mother might lead to a child being evasive as a way to avoid rejection or negative feedback. An underaffectionate mother might not necessarily lead to evasive and dawdling behavior, as these behaviors are more commonly associated with avoidance or resistance, which is not typically a response to lack of affection. Therefore, the most likely options are either an overprotective or authoritarian mother.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Authoritarian mother.\"}"
