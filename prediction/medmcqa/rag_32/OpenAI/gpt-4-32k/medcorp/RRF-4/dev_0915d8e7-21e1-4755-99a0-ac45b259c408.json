    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a type of bias that arises from evaluating data on patients and hospital records only, which increases the probability of exposure to a particular factor. From the documents, Berksonian bias or admission bias is described as a subtype of selection bias that occurs when the selected study population is derived from patients within hospitals or certain specialty clinics.

Therefore, the answer is Berksonian bias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
