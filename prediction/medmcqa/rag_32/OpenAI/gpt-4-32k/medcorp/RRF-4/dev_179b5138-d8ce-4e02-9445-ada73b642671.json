    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PCR is a technique that amplifies DNA, not RNA, so option A is incorrect. Sanger's technique is a method of DNA sequencing, so option B is incorrect. Western blot is a method used to detect specific protein molecules from among a mixture of proteins, so option D is incorrect. Next generation sequencing, however, can be used to sequence RNA as well as DNA, as mentioned in Document [0], [3], [15], and [19]. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
