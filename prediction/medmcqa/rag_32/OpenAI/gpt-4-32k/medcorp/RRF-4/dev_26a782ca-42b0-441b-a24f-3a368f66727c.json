    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a situation where a pediatrician in a district hospital with a neonatal care unit would call an ophthalmologist for a consultation. Ophthalmologists are eye specialists, so the situation would likely involve an eye-related issue. Looking at the options, A, C, and D do not directly relate to eye issues. However, option B mentions a baby born at 28 weeks of gestation. Premature babies, like the one mentioned in option B, are at risk for a condition called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which can lead to blindness if not treated. This is mentioned in documents 16, 30, and 31. Therefore, a pediatrician would likely call an ophthalmologist for a consultation for a baby born at 28 weeks of gestation due to the risk of ROP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
