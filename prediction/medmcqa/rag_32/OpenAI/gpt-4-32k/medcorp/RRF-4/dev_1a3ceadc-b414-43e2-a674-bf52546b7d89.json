    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metronidazole is mentioned in Document 1 as a DNA inhibitor that acts upon anaerobic bacteria by generating metabolites that are incorporated into DNA strands, which then are more prone to breakage. This indicates that Metronidazole interferes with DNA function. Nystatin is not mentioned in any of the documents, so it can't be confirmed that it interferes with DNA function. Tetracycline is mentioned in Document 23 as an inhibitor of mitochondrial biogenesis, but it's not specifically stated that it interferes with DNA function. Sulphonamides are not mentioned in any of the documents, so it can't be confirmed that they interfere with DNA function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
