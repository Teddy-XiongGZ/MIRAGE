    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a type of anchorage that is not being applied. To answer this question, I need to understand what each type of anchorage means. Reciprocal anchorage is when two units of teeth move towards each other with equal distance. Stationary anchorage is when the teeth move in a translation manner, not tipping. Intramaxillary anchorage is not mentioned in any of the documents, so it seems like it's not being applied. Intraoral anchorage is when the anchorage is applied within the oral cavity, which is a common practice in orthodontics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
