    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The duration of action of proparacaine is not explicitly stated in any of the documents. However, Document [1] mentions that the maximum anesthetic duration was 20 minutes with aqueous proparacaine. Document [2] also mentions that the maximal anesthetic effect lasted for 15 minutes for the 1-drop treatment and 25 minutes for the 2-drop treatment. Document [3] states that the total duration of effect was 20 minutes for females and 25 minutes for males for both anesthetics. Document [4] mentions that corneal sensitivity was significantly reduced from baseline for 25 minutes following topical administration of ophthalmic proparacaine. Document [17] mentions that duration of corneal anesthesia achieved by use of proparacaine was 25 minutes. Document [25] mentions that after instillation of tetracaine, the IOP decreased gradually, such that after 15 min, the IOP was significantly lower than the baseline and control values. Proparacaine also reduced IOP after 10 min compared to baseline values. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that the duration of action of proparacaine is around 20 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 20min\"}"
