    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most sensitive test for nitrous oxide detection. Looking at the documents, Document [27] mentions the use of a highly sensitive photoacoustic infrared spectrometry analyser for measuring nitrous oxide levels. Document [28] also mentions the use of an infra-red analyzer for measuring nitrous oxide levels. None of the other options (Laminar flow, Dosimeter, High suction speed) are mentioned in the documents as methods for detecting nitrous oxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Infrared spectrophotometer\"}"
