    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the treatment options for a T2N0 stage SCC on the lateral margin of the tongue. According to Document [26], supraomohyoid neck dissection (SOHND) is an effective treatment for oral tongue SCC. However, the document also mentions that the location of the tumor can affect the treatment decision. Since the tumor in the question is located on the lateral margin of the tongue, it's important to consider if SOHND is still the best option. Document [23] also supports the use of SOHND for oral tongue SCC, but it doesn't specify the location of the tumor. Document [29] suggests that the treatment of neck nodes in early SCC of the oral tongue can be expectant in cases where tumor thickness is less than 4 mm, but where it is more than 4 mm elective treatment of the neck is recommended. However, the question does not provide information about the thickness of the tumor. Therefore, based on the available information, SOHND seems to be the most recommended treatment for T2N0 stage SCC on the lateral margin of the tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
