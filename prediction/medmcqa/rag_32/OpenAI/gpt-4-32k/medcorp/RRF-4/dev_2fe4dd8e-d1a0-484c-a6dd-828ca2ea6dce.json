    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a complex structure that involves various nerves for its function. According to Document [0], the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular portion (V3) of the trigeminal nerve, innervates the lateral capsule of the TMJ. The masseteric nerve, a branch of the maxillary portion (V2) of the trigeminal nerve, innervates the anteromedial capsule of the TMJ. The facial nerve and auricular nerve are not mentioned in the context of TMJ innervation. Therefore, both the auriculotemporal nerve and masseteric nerve are involved in the sensory nerve supply of the TMJ capsule. However, since the question asks for the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of the TMJ and the masseteric nerve is not one of the options, the answer should be the auriculotemporal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
