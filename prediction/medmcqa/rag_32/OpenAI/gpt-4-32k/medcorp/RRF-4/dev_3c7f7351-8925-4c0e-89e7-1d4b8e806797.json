    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several types of space maintainers used in pediatric dentistry, including band and loop space maintainers, acrylic partial dentures, and restored deciduous teeth. However, the documents do not mention the use of a distal shoe space maintainer. Document [1] mentions that space maintainers are integral to preventive and interceptive orthodontics, maintaining function, preserving arch length, and allowing the permanent tooth to erupt unhindered into proper alignment. Document [4] mentions that the use of a space maintainer appliance, or restoration of a carious primary tooth that can then act as a natural space maintainer, may potentially obviate the consequences of loss of arch length. Document [15] mentions that conventional tube and loop space maintainers were found to be most efficacious in terms of survival time, gingival health, and patients' satisfaction. However, the question asks for the 'best' space maintainer, and based on the documents, it seems that the band and loop space maintainer is most commonly used and has been found to be effective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Band and loop space maintainer\"}"
