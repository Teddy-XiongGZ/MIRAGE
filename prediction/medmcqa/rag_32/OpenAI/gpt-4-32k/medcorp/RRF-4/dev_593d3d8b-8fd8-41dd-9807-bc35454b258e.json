    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most recent oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) for acute stroke prevention. From the documents, it is clear that Ximelagatran was discontinued due to safety concerns (Document 29). Idraparinux is not mentioned as a DTI, but as a factor Xa inhibitor (Document 20). Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist, not a DTI (Document 24). Dabigatran is mentioned as an oral DTI in multiple documents (Document 0, Document 1, Document 10, Document 17, Document 24) and is indicated for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (Document 10, Document 17). Therefore, Dabigatran is the most recent oral DTI for acute stroke prevention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
