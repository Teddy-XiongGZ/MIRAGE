    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bite cells are abnormally shaped mature red blood cells with one or more semicircular portions removed from the cell margin, known as 'bites'. These 'bites' result from the mechanical removal of denatured hemoglobin during splenic filtration. Bite cells are known to be a result from processes of oxidative hemolysis, such as Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, in which uncontrolled oxidative stress causes hemoglobin to denature and form Heinz bodies. Therefore, bite cells are seen in G6PD deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
