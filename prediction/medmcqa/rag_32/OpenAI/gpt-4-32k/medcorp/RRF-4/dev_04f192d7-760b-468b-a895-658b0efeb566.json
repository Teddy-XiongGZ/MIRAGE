    "Based on the information provided in the documents, the sequence of the auditory pathway from peripheral to central is as follows: 1. Cochlear nucleus: The cochlear nucleus is the first relay center in the central auditory system where the auditory nerve enters the brainstem (Document [0], [1], [2], [3], [6], [10], [16], [18], [22], [25], [30]). 2. Inferior colliculus: The signal then travels to the inferior colliculus, which is a part of the midbrain (Document [0], [1], [2], [3], [6], [10], [15], [16], [17], [22], [25], [30]). 3. Medial geniculate body: From the inferior colliculus, the signal is transmitted to the medial geniculate body, which is a part of the thalamus (Document [0], [1], [2], [3], [6], [10], [15], [16], [17], [22], [25], [30]). 4. Auditory cortex: Finally, the signal reaches the auditory cortex, which is the part of the brain responsible for processing auditory information (Document [0], [1], [2], [3], [6], [10], [15], [16], [17], [22], [25], [30]). Therefore, the correct sequence is Cochlear nucleus > Inferior colliculus > Medial geniculate body > Auditory cortex, which corresponds to option B. The JSON output is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, the signal enters the cochlear nucleus, which is the first relay center in the central auditory system.
