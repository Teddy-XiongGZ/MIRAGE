    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness and fatigue of various muscle groups. Ptosis, or drooping of the eyelids, is a common symptom of myasthenia gravis, as mentioned in Document [11]. Muscle fatigability, or the tendency for muscles to become easily fatigued, is also a characteristic symptom of myasthenia gravis, as mentioned in Document [15]. Normal pupillary reflex is not affected by myasthenia gravis, as the disease primarily affects skeletal muscles, not the muscles controlling the pupils. However, deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are typically normal in myasthenia gravis, as the disease affects the neuromuscular junction, not the nerves or muscles involved in deep tendon reflexes. Therefore, the statement 'Absent DTRs' is not typically seen in myasthenia gravis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
