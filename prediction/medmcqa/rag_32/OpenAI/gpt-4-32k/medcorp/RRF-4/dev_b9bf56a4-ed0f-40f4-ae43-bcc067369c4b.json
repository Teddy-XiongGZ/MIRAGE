    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Work hardening, also known as strain hardening, is the process of strengthening a metal through plastic deformation. This occurs due to the dislocation movements and dislocation generation within the crystal structure of a material. When an orthodontic wire is permanently bent during its clinical application, it undergoes work hardening. This process results in an increase in the strength of the wire as the dislocations create a harder, stronger metal. However, this also leads to a decrease in ductility, or the ability of the metal to be stretched into a wire without breaking, because the hardened metal becomes more brittle. Additionally, the process of work hardening develops internal stresses within the metal due to the movement and generation of dislocations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
