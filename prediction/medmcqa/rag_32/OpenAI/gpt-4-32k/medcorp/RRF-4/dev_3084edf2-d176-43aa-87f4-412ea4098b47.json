    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha-thalassemia is a condition where there is a decrease in the production of alpha globin chains, leading to an excess of beta chains in adults. This condition does not affect the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) or HbA2, which are made up of different globin chains. Therefore, in alpha-thalassemia trait, both HbF and HbA2 levels should be normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Normal HbF and normal HbA2\"}"
