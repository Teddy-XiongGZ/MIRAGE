    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelinated nerve fibres are known for their fast conduction speed due to the myelin sheath that insulates the nerve fibre and allows for saltatory conduction, where the nerve impulse jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next. This is mentioned in Document [0], Document [2], Document [12], Document [27], and Document [24]. Therefore, the statement that conduction is slower in myelinated than in non-myelinated fibres is incorrect. The other options are correct. The current does discharge at nodes of Ranvier (Document [27]), the outer layer of myelinated fibres is made of lipids (Document [11]), and depolarisation occurs only at nodes of Ranvier (Document [24]).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
