    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the average diameter of the apical foramen in an 18-25 years old adult. Document [6] states that the average size of the orifice is 0.3 to 0.4 mm in diameter. Document [28] states that the canal diameter decreased very significantly in the apical third. Document [16] states that the average distance from the major foramen was -0.13 mm with a range of -1.28 mm and +0.46 mm. Document [24] states that the average distance in 26 detectable CDJ samples was +0.18 mm with a range of -0.98 mm and +0.65 mm. Document [0] states that the mean maximum and minimum diameter of the minor apical foramina ranged from 0.158 to 0.323 mm. Considering all these documents, the closest answer to the average diameter of the apical foramen in an 18-25 years old adult would be 400 micrometers (or 0.4 mm).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
