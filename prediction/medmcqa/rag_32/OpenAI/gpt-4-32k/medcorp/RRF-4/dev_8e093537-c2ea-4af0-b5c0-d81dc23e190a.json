    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Km value is a term often used in enzyme kinetics. According to Document [14], the Km value is the concentration of substrate that allows the reaction to proceed at one-half its maximum rate (0.5 Vmax). This means that the Km value indicates the substrate concentration at half maximal velocity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
