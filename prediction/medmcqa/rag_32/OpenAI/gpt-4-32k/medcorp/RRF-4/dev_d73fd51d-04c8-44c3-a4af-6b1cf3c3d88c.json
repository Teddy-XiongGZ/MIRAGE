    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chelation is a process in which a molecule forms more than one bond with a metal ion. In the context of antibiotics, some of them can chelate with metal ions, including calcium. According to Document [2], antibiotic drugs of the tetracycline family are chelators of Ca2+ ions. Document [12] also mentions that most tetracyclines bind with food and also easily with magnesium, aluminium, iron and calcium, which reduces their ability to be completely absorbed by the body. Document [30] also mentions that tetracycline is able to chelate calcium ions. Therefore, the antibiotic that chelates with calcium is Tetracycline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
