    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resolving power of a microscope is the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects. According to the documents, this ability depends on several factors. The size of the aperture, or the opening that allows light to reach the lens, affects the amount of light that can enter the microscope, which in turn affects the resolution (Document [5]). The wavelength of the light source used also affects the resolution, as different wavelengths of light can reveal different levels of detail (Document [0]). The thickness of the specimen being observed can also affect the resolution, as it can affect the amount of light that can pass through and be detected by the microscope (Document [0]). However, the focal length of the eyepiece, which is the distance between the lens and the image it forms, does not directly affect the resolving power of the microscope. Instead, it affects the magnification of the image, which is a separate aspect of the microscope's performance (Document [6]).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Focal length of the eyepiece\"}"
