    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) supplies blood to the anterior and inferior parts of the cerebellum, and parts of the pons. An infarction in the AICA can lead to a lateral pontine syndrome, also known as AICA syndrome. The symptoms of AICA syndrome include sudden onset of vertigo and vomiting, nystagmus, dysarthria, falling to the side of the lesion (due to damage to vestibular nuclei), and a variety of ipsilateral features including hemiataxia, loss of all modalities of sensation of the face (due to damage to the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus), facial paralysis (due to damage to the facial nucleus), and hearing loss and tinnitus (due to damage to the cochlear nuclei). Therefore, the vestibular nuclei can be affected by an infarction of the AICA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
