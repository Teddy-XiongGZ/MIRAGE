    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Bishop score is calculated based on five parameters: cervical dilation, effacement, station, consistency, and position. Each parameter is given a score and the total Bishop score is the sum of these scores. According to the information given, the cervix is 1 cm dilated (which gives a score of 1), 30% effaced (which gives a score of 1), the vertex is at -1 station (which gives a score of 1), the cervix is soft (which gives a score of 2), and the cervix is posterior (which gives a score of 0). Adding these scores together gives a total Bishop score of 5.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
