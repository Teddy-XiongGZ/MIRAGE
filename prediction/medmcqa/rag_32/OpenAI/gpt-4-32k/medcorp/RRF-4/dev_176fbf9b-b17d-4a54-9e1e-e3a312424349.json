    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question does not provide any specific details about the lesions, making it difficult to determine the causative organism based solely on the question. However, by looking at the relevant documents, we can make some educated guesses. Document [3] describes a case of an infant with a papular eruption that started on the face and was caused by Coxsackie virus A6. Document [9] describes a case of a lesion on the hand caused by a parapoxvirus, which is not one of the options. Document [13] describes a case of a bullous skin lesion, but it does not specify the causative organism. Document [16] describes a case of non-tuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis, which is also not one of the options. Document [25] describes a case of an epidermal nevus, which is a skin condition, not an infection. Based on the available documents, the most likely causative organism seems to be Coxsackie virus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
