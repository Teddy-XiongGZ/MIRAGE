    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the ATP production from anaerobic glycolysis of a certain molecule. From the documents, it is clear that anaerobic glycolysis of glucose produces 2 ATPs per unit glucose consumed. However, none of the documents provide information about the ATP production from anaerobic glycolysis of amino acid, fructose, galactose, or glycogen. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it is not possible to determine which of these produces 3 ATPs per unit glucose consumed during anaerobic glycolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to answer the question.\"}"
