    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the space between the apical constriction and the apical foramen. The apical constriction is the narrowest part of the root canal, while the apical foramen is the opening at the tip of the root of a tooth. From the documents, it is not explicitly mentioned that the space between these two points is funnel-shaped, hyperbolic, or morning glory. However, based on the general understanding of the anatomy of a tooth, the space between the apical constriction and the apical foramen would likely be funnel-shaped, as the canal narrows towards the apical constriction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
