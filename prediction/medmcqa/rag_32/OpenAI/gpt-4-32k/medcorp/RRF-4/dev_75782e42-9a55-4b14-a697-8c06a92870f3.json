    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A conventional gingivectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of gum tissue. According to the documents, it is primarily used to eliminate suprabony pockets (Document 2) and false pockets (Document 1). It is also used to treat gingival overgrowth (Document 1, Document 9). However, it does not preserve the width of attached gingiva (Document 29) and it does not facilitate healing by primary intention, as it involves the removal of tissue and thus requires time for healing and tissue regeneration (Document 12). Therefore, the correct answer is that a conventional gingivectomy eliminates false pockets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
