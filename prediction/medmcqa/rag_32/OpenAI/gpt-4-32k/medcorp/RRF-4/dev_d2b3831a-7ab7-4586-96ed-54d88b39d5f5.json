    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chlortetracycline is a type of antibiotic, and antibiotics typically work by either inhibiting cell wall formation, interfering with metabolism, inhibiting protein synthesis, or interfering with DNA function. To find the specific mechanism of action for chlortetracycline, I need to look for information in the documents that directly states or implies how it works. Document [30] mentions that during the inhibition of Escherichia coli by chlortetracycline, protein synthesis was sharply reduced. This suggests that chlortetracycline works by inhibiting protein synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
