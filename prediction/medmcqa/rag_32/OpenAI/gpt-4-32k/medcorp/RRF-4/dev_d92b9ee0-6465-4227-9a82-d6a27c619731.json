    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about the buffering capacity of saliva in caries-free individuals. Document [22] mentions that the buffer capacity of saliva in caries-free individuals is not significantly different from that in caries-active individuals. However, Document [14] states that caries-free individuals have a higher salivary flow rate, pH, and buffering capacity compared to caries-active individuals. Document [11] also supports this, stating that caries-free children have a higher salivary flow rate, pH, and buffering capacity. Therefore, it can be concluded that caries-free individuals have a high buffering capacity for acids in their saliva.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
