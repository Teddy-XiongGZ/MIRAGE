    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transient diabetes insipidus during pregnancy is often caused by the increased activity of an enzyme called vasopressinase, which is produced in the placenta. Vasopressinase breaks down the hormone vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to the symptoms of diabetes insipidus. This is mentioned in multiple documents, such as Document [0], Document [1], Document [3], Document [6], Document [8], Document [9], Document [11], Document [16], Document [18], Document [21], Document [23], and Document [31]. None of the options provided in the question (severe preeclampsia, hydramnios, multiple pregnancy, IUGR) are directly linked to the cause of transient diabetes insipidus during pregnancy in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
