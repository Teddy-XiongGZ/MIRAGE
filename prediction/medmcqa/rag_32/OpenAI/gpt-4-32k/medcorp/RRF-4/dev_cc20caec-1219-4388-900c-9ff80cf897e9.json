    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thyroid storm is a severe manifestation of thyrotoxicosis and can present with multiorgan failure. It is primarily a clinical diagnosis, further aided by abnormal thyroid function tests. It is usually precipitated by a stressor such as trauma to the thyroid, infections, acute iodine load, withdrawal from the antithyroid medication, or surgical procedures (including thyroid surgery). In this case, the patient underwent thyroidectomy and then presented with features of thyroid storm. This suggests that the surgery could have been a stressor that precipitated the thyroid storm. However, the specific cause would depend on the details of the case. Poor antibiotic coverage could potentially lead to an infection, which could precipitate a thyroid storm. Rough handling during surgery could potentially cause trauma to the thyroid, which could also precipitate a thyroid storm. Removal of the parathyroid glands could potentially cause hypocalcemia, which could contribute to the symptoms of a thyroid storm. However, inadequate preoperative preparation, such as not adequately controlling the hyperthyroidism before surgery, is a common cause of postoperative thyroid storm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Inadequate preoperative preparation\"}"
