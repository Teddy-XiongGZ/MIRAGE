    "First, we need to determine how many milligrams of ceftriaxone are in each milliliter of the solution. According to the information provided, there are 500 mg in 5 ml, which means there are 100 mg in each milliliter. Next, we need to determine how many milliliters are needed to provide the required 180 mg dose. Since there are 100 mg in each milliliter, we need 1.8 ml to provide 180 mg. Finally, we need to determine how many divisions of the 2 ml syringe this corresponds to. Since there are 10 divisions per milliliter, this means there are 20 divisions in the 2 ml syringe. Therefore, 1.8 ml corresponds to 18 divisions of the syringe. So, the answer is B. 18. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I determined how many milligrams of ceftriaxone are in each milliliter of the solution.
