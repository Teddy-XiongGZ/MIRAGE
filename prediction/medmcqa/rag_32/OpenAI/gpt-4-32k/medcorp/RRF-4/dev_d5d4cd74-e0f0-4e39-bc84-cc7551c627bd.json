    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the necessary investigations for a patient with tubercular meningitis who has experienced a deterioration in sensorium after one month of regular anti-tubercular treatment (ATT). The deterioration in sensorium could be due to several reasons, including progression of the disease, drug toxicity, or a paradoxical reaction to the treatment. An MRI or NCCT would be useful to assess any changes in the brain that could be causing the altered sensorium. A CSF examination would be necessary to evaluate the ongoing infection and inflammation in the meninges. Liver function tests would be important to assess for any hepatotoxicity from the ATT, which could potentially contribute to the altered sensorium. Therefore, all of these investigations seem necessary in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
