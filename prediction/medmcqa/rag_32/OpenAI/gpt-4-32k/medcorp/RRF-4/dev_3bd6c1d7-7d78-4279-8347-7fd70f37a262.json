    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The myosin head detaches from actin during the muscle contraction cycle. This happens after the power stroke, where the myosin head moves and the actin filament slides. According to Document [18], the myosin head remains attached to actin in a rigor state until another ATP binds to myosin. Once another ATP binds to myosin, the myosin head will again detach from actin. This suggests that the binding of ATP to the myosin head triggers its detachment from actin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
