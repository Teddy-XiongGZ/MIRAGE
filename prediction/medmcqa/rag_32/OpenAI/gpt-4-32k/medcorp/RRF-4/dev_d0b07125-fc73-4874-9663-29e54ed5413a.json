Step 2: Review each choice in light of the provided documents. Choice A: ASO can be increased in school children. Document [30] mentions that ASO titers were studied in school children and the upper limit of normal ASO titer was found to be higher in some years. This suggests that ASO can indeed be increased in school children. Choice B: May be negative in post streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Document [19] mentions that in a patient with suspected post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, ASO titres can be negative even after strep pharyngitis. This suggests that ASO may indeed be negative in post streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Choice C: ASO titre included in major criteria in jones criteria. Jones criteria are used for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever. None of the provided documents mention that ASO titre is included in the major criteria of Jones criteria. Choice D: May not be elevated in 20% cases of carditis. Document [26] mentions that in 77% of the patients with rheumatic carditis, the ASO titers were elevated. This suggests that in about 23% of cases, the ASO titers may not be elevated, which is close to the 20% mentioned in the choice. Step 3: Based on the review, Choice C is the only one that is not supported by the provided documents. So, the answer is Choice C: ASO titre included in major criteria in jones criteria. Output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each choice in light of the provided documents.
