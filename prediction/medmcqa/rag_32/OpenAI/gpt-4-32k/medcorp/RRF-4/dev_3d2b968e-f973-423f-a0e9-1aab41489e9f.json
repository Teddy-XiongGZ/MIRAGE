    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lingual ridge is a feature of the teeth. According to Document [0], the lingual ridge extends from the cingulum to the cusp tip on the lingual surface of most canines. Document [3] also mentions that maxillary canines have a well-developed lingual ridge. Therefore, the lingual ridge is most prominent in canines. Now, we need to determine whether it is more prominent in upper or lower canines. Document [11] mentions that the cingulum of mandibular canines is smoother and rounded, which might suggest that the lingual ridge is less prominent in lower canines. Therefore, the lingual ridge is most likely most prominent in upper canines.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
