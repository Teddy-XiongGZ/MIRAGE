    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-year-old with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) and recurrent gingival swelling and pain in teeth 61 and 62. S-ECC is a form of tooth decay that affects young children and can lead to pain, infection, and tooth loss if not treated. Given the patient's age and the severity of the condition, endodontic treatment or restoration might not be the best options. These procedures can be complex and may not be suitable for a young child. Fluoride application is typically used as a preventive measure, not a treatment for existing caries. Therefore, extraction might be the most suitable treatment option in this case, as it would remove the source of the infection and pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
