    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I will look for each of the options in the documents. Trichloroacetic acid is not mentioned in any of the documents, but it is a known method for protein precipitation, so it's not the correct answer. Heat precipitation is also not mentioned in the documents, but it is a known method for protein precipitation, so it's not the correct answer either. The isoelectric point method is mentioned in Document [5] as a method for protein precipitation, so it's not the correct answer. Finally, titration with reducing sugar is not mentioned in any of the documents and it is not a known method for protein precipitation, so it is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
