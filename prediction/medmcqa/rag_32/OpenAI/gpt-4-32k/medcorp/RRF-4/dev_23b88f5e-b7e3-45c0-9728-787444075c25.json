    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], brush stiffness is predominantly affected by bristle modulus, bristle and tuft diameter, the number of tufts, the number of bristles per unit area packed into a tuft hole, and the trim length of bristles. Bristle composition and shape had no measurable effect. Therefore, the stiffness of the bristles of a nylon toothbrush is dependent on the diameter and length of the filament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
