    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the management of a pregnant woman with late, variable deceleration and cervical dilation of 6 cm who is being prepared for surgery. The options provided are all interventions that could be used in this scenario. A supine position is usually avoided in pregnant women due to the risk of supine hypotensive syndrome, where the enlarged uterus compresses the inferior vena cava, reducing venous return to the heart and potentially causing hypotension. Oxygen inhalation is commonly used to increase oxygen supply to the fetus, especially in cases of fetal distress indicated by abnormal heart rate patterns. Intravenous fluids are also commonly administered to maintain hydration and support blood pressure. Subcutaneous terbutaline is a tocolytic agent used to inhibit uterine contractions, which would not typically be administered if the woman is already in active labor with significant cervical dilation and being prepared for surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
