    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the statement that is not true about enamel rods. Step 2: Review each answer choice against the information in the documents. A. Length of enamel rods is same as the thickness of enamel - Document [24] states that \"Each enamel rod spans the full thickness of the enamel layer from the dentin showing dentinal tubules interglobular spaces odontoblasts gingival sulcus epithelium of gingiva pulp chamber granular layer of Tomes fibers of periodontal membrane alveolar bone with marrow pulp canal cellular cementum apical foramen\". This suggests that the length of enamel rods is the same as the thickness of enamel. B. Enamel rods are narrow at DEJ and wide at tooth surface - Document [2] describes the enamel rod as having a \"keyhole\" shape, with the top, or head, oriented toward the crown of the tooth and the bottom, or tail, oriented toward the root of the tooth. This suggests that enamel rods are wider at the tooth surface and narrower at the DEJ. C. Under light microscope seen as Fish scale - Document [4] mentions that the rod sheath is attributed with giving tooth enamel a \"fish-scale\" appearance under a microscope when the enamel has been demineralized or acid-etched. This suggests that enamel rods can appear as fish scales under a light microscope. D. Tail is more resistant to caries than the core - None of the documents provided information to support this statement. Step 3: Choose the answer that is not supported by the documents. Based on the information in the documents, the statement \"Tail is more resistant to caries than the core\" is not supported and is therefore likely to be the correct answer. The final output in json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each answer choice against the information in the documents. All the statements except 'Tail is more resistant to caries than the core' are supported by the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
