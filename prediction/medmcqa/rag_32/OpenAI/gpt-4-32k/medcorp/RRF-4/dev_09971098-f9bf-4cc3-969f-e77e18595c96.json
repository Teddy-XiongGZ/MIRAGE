    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of primary infertility and a hysterosalpingogram has shown bilateral tubal block at the cornu. This means that the fallopian tubes are blocked, preventing the egg from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus. This is a common cause of infertility. The next step in management would depend on the severity of the blockage and the patient's overall health and desire for pregnancy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) could be an option as it bypasses the fallopian tubes entirely. However, a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy could be performed to further evaluate the extent of the blockage and possibly clear it. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is a type of IVF and would also bypass the fallopian tubes. Tuboplasty is a surgical procedure to repair or remove blockages in the fallopian tubes. Given that the blockage has been identified, the next logical step would be to further investigate the blockage with a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
