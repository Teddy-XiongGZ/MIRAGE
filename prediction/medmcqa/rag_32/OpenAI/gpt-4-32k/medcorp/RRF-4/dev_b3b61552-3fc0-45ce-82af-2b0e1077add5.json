    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mandibular fractures are often treated with mini plates. These plates are used to stabilize the fracture and allow for healing. This type of treatment is considered a form of osteosynthesis, which is a surgical procedure that stabilizes and joins the ends of fractured bones by mechanical devices such as metal plates, pins, rods, wires or screws. In the case of mini plates, they are not designed to bear the full load of the mandible, but rather to share the load with the healing bone. Therefore, this type of treatment is considered load sharing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
