    "First, I will look for information about where Purkinje fibers project to in the provided documents. Document [28] mentions that the output of the Purkinje cell circuit gets routed via the deep cerebellar nuclei to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. This suggests that Purkinje fibers project to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Therefore, the answer is D. Ventero lateral nucleus of thalamus. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I looked for information about where Purkinje fibers project to in the provided documents.
