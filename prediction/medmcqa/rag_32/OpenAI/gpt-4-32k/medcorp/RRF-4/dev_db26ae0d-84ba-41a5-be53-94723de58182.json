    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where there is significant bleeding in the space of Retzius during a Burch operation, and the source of the bleeding cannot be visualized. The Burch operation is a surgical procedure performed to treat stress urinary incontinence, and it involves the space of Retzius, which is an anatomical space in the pelvic region. From the documents, it is clear that bleeding in this area can be a complication of the procedure. Document [8] mentions the use of a drain in the space of Retzius during a similar operation, which could help control bleeding. Document [19] also mentions a method of evacuating severe organized clot retention using a catheter connected with wall suction, which could be applicable in this situation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management would be to place a surgical drain in the space of Retzius to control the bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
