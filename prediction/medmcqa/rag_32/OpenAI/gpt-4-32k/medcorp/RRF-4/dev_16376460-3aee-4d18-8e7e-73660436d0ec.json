    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The connective tissue width around an implant is referred to as the biological width. According to Document [0], the biological width dimension ranged between 2.55 \u00b1 0.16 and 3.26 \u00b1 0.15 for one- and two-piece implants, respectively. Document [3] mentions that the biological width around an implant is a 3-4mm distance from the top of the peri-implant mucosa to the first bone-to-implant contact. Document [4] also mentions that the overall height of the soft tissue, that is, the biologic width, was around 4 to 4.5 mm. Therefore, the connective tissue width around an implant can range from 2.55 mm to 4.5 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 4-4.5 mm\"}"
