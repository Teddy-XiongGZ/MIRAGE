    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Basophils are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the immune response, particularly in allergic reactions and inflammation. According to Document [1], basophils are activated when they bind to certain substances, including IgE, an immunoglobulin involved in allergic reactions. This is further supported by Document [7] and Document [8], which state that basophils have receptors for IgE and are activated when IgE binds to these receptors. Therefore, the correct answer is that basophils are activated by cell fixed IgE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
