    "First, I will look for information about the cusps of the mandibular first molar in the provided documents. Document [9] provides the information I need. It states that the mandibular first molar has five cusps: the mesiobuccal (MB, toward midline and cheek), mesiolingual (ML, toward midline and tongue), distolingual (DL, away from midline and towards tongue), distobuccal (DB, away from midline and toward cheek), and distal (D, away from midline), listed in order of decreasing size. Therefore, the smallest cusp of the mandibular first molar is the distal cusp. So, the answer is B. Distal. The output in json will be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I found the information about the cusps of the mandibular first molar in Document [9]. It states that the mandibular first molar has five cusps, listed in order of decreasing size. Therefore, the smallest cusp is the distal cusp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
