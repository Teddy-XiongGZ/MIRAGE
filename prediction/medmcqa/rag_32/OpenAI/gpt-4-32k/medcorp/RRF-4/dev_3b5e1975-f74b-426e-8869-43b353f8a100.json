    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand the properties of high copper silver alloy. From Document [7], I learned that high copper amalgams show superior physical properties and clinical performance to low copper amalgams. This suggests that high copper silver alloy likely has increased tensile and compressive strength, which aligns with option A. Document [27] also supports this, stating that copper alloys have high resistance against corrosion, which contradicts option B. Document [4] suggests that high copper silver alloy develops resistance to creep, which could be interpreted as greater edge strength, aligning with option C. However, none of the documents provided information about the mercury content in the final restoration of high copper silver alloy, making it difficult to confirm or refute option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
