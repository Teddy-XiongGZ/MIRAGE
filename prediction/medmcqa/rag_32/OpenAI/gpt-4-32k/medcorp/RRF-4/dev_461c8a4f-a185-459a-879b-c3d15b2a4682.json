    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The growth of the maxilla is a complex process that involves various mechanisms. According to Document [0], the growth of the maxilla is enhanced by the participation of the intramembranous bone formation along the periphery. This suggests that the maxilla grows by adding new bone tissue, which is a process known as apposition. Document [1] also supports this by stating that the maxilla grows vertically and in width, which would require the addition of new bone tissue. Document [4] further supports this by stating that growth of the maxilla is due to special movements of translation, rotation, and elongation as well as to growth of its skeletal units and skeletal structures. Therefore, the answer is C. Apposition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
