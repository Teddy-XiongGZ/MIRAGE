    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking which statement about Garre's osteomyelitis is not true. Step 2: Review each answer choice in relation to the documents provided. A. Common in children and young - This is true. According to documents 1, 4, 5, 6, 14, 17, and 23, Garre's osteomyelitis mainly affects children and young adults. B. Occurs due to staphylococcus aureus - This is not explicitly stated in the documents. However, document 26 mentions that osteomyelitis sclerosans Garr\u00e9 is caused by bacterial infection, but in most cases, no bacterial growth can be discovered in culture. It does not specify staphylococcus aureus as the cause. C. Moth eaten appearance in radiography - This is not mentioned in the documents. The documents mention \"onion skin\" appearance in radiography (documents 3, 5, 16, 17, 22), but not \"moth eaten\" appearance. D. Prevalent in immune-competent patients - This is not explicitly stated in the documents. However, it is mentioned in several documents (1, 4, 5, 6, 14, 17, 23) that Garre's osteomyelitis is associated with mild irritation or infections, suggesting that it can occur in immune-competent patients. Step 3: Choose the answer that is not supported by the documents. The statement \"Occurs due to staphylococcus aureus\" (B) is not supported by the documents. Therefore, this is the correct answer. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement about Garre's osteomyelitis is not true. After reviewing each answer choice in relation to the documents provided, it is clear that the statement 'Occurs due to staphylococcus aureus' is not supported by the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
