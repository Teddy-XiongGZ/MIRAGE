    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the potential long-term effects of a congenital HCMV infection. Document [0] mentions that congenital HCMV infection can have long-term sequelae, but it does not specify what these are. Document [1] mentions that neonates with HCMV infection can develop sequelae later on, but again, it does not specify what these are. Document [3] mentions that neonates with asymptomatic HCMV infection can develop various sequelae during infancy, but it does not specify what these are. Document [4] mentions a fatal case of congenital CMV infection, but it does not specify the long-term effects. Document [12] mentions that HCMV infection is a significant disease both in congenital and perinatal period and that diagnosed patients need to be monitored for a long time with special attention to their neurodevelopmental follow-ups. Document [28] mentions that moderate or severe outcomes were reported in 11% of children with congenital CMV identified through population screening, all by 1 year; all impairment detected after this age was mild. Document [29] mentions that most infants with congenital Toxoplasma gondii infection have no symptoms at birth, but many will have retinal disease or neurologic abnormalities later in life. This suggests that congenital infections can have long-term neurological effects. Given these documents, the most likely answer is that the child is at risk of mental retardation or sensorineural hearing loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mental retardation\"}"
