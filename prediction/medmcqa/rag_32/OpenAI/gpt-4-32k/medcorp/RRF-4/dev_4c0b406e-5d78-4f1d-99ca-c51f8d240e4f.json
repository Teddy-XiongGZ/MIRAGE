    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Inhalation burns are usually associated with signs of respiratory distress and damage to the respiratory tract. This can include symptoms such as hoarseness and stridor of voice, which indicate damage to the vocal cords and upper airway (Choice C). Blackish soot deposit on the posterior part of the tongue (Choice B) can also be a sign of inhalation burns, as it suggests that the patient has inhaled smoke or other burning materials. Yellow colored sputum (Choice A) can also be a sign of inhalation injury as it may indicate an infection or inflammation in the lungs caused by inhalation of hot gases or smoke. However, singeing of eyebrows and facial hair (Choice D) is not a direct proof of inhalation burns. While it may suggest exposure to a flame or heat source, it does not necessarily indicate that the patient has inhaled hot gases or smoke, which would cause inhalation burns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
