    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific technique for palpating the thyroid gland. The technique involves placing a thumb on the lateral side of the trachea while the patient swallows. Looking through the documents, none of them mention a specific name for this technique. However, Document [1] and Document [17] describe a similar technique but do not provide a name. None of the documents mention Lahey's method, Kocher's test, Pizzilo method, or Crile method in relation to thyroid palpation. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it is not possible to definitively choose an answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"The documents do not provide enough information to choose an answer.\"}"
