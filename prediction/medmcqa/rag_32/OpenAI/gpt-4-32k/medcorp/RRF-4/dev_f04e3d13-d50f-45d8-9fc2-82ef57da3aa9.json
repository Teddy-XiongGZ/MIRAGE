    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Penicillinase is an enzyme that inactivates penicillin, rendering it ineffective. Therefore, we need an antibiotic that is resistant to penicillinase. According to Document [0], infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci should be treated with a penicillinase-resistant penicillin. Document [13] states that ampicillin is contraindicated in the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase-producing organisms, so option A is not correct. Document [14] does not mention dicloxacillin, so we cannot confirm if it is effective against penicillinase-producing organisms. Document [28] states that erythromycin was curative in a case of B melaninogenicus infection secondary to a fractured mandible, where the organisms were both clinically resistant and insensitive on culture to penicillin and were shown to produce beta-lactamase. Therefore, erythromycin (option C) seems to be a suitable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
