    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Group II sensory fibers are mentioned in several documents. Document [0] states that proprioceptors are innervated by type II sensory fibers. Document [3] mentions that Group II or A-beta fibers transmit proprioceptive input from secondary endings of muscle spindles and touch and pressure input from specialized receptors in the skin and deep tissues. Document [14] also mentions that proprioceptors receive innervation via type II sensory fibers. However, none of these documents specify the exact type of ending these fibers are attached to. Document [15] mentions that Type II sensory fibers are slowly-adapting and belong to pseudounipolar neurons, with examples including neurons with Merkel cell-neurite complexes and Ruffini endings. However, these are not among the answer choices. Therefore, we need to look at the answer choices and see which one fits best with the information we have. Annulospiral endings are associated with muscle spindles, which are mentioned in relation to Group II fibers in Document [3]. Golgi tendon organs are mentioned in Document [0], but they are associated with type Ib fibers, not type II. Flower spray endings are not mentioned in any of the documents. Pacinian corpuscles are mentioned in Document [3], but they are associated with Group III fibers, not type II. Therefore, based on the information available, the most likely answer is Annulospiral ending.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
