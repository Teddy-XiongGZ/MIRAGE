    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, which often presents with symptoms such as optic neuritis and transverse myelitis, as mentioned in Document [31]. This suggests that bilateral visual loss (Choice B) could be a symptom of multiple sclerosis. Document [0] mentions that in all cases but one, oligoclonal bands were detected on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) electrophoresis in patients with demyelinating myelopathy. This suggests that the absence of oligoclonal bands (Choice C) could be less likely to suggest progression to multiple sclerosis. Document [24] mentions that a poor prognosis is often associated with multiple sclerosis, suggesting that a poor prognosis (Choice D) could indicate progression to multiple sclerosis. Complete cord transection (Choice A) is not mentioned in any of the documents as a feature of multiple sclerosis, making it the least likely to suggest progression to the disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
