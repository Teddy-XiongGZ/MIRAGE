    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Golgi tendon organs are proprioceptors that sense changes in muscle tension. They are located at the interface between a muscle and its tendon, known as the musculotendinous junction. When the muscle generates force, the sensory terminals of the Golgi tendon organs are compressed, which leads to the firing of nerve impulses that signal the force being developed by the muscle. Therefore, the Golgi tendon organs detect muscle tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
