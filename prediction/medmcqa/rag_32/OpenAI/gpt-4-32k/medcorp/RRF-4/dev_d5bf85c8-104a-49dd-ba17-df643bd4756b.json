    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best emergency treatment to prevent the tongue from falling back in case of facial injuries where voluntary control over the tongue is lost. Document [0] mentions that in cases of massive lower jaw injuries, the management challenges begin with lifesaving which is possibly complicated by airway compromise, severe hemorrhage, massive lower jaw loss, and a prolapsed tongue. Document [3] and [4] talk about prevention techniques focusing on preventing the tongue from falling back and obstructing the airways, such as head-tilt/chin-lift and jaw-thrust maneuvers. However, these techniques require the patient to be conscious and able to follow instructions, which may not be the case in severe facial injuries. Document [10] also mentions that bilateral mandible fractures that are unstable can cause the tongue to fall back and block the airway. However, none of these documents provide a clear answer to the question. Document [17] talks about a procedure for tongue stabilization in severe war injuries to the mandible, which prevents the serious complications of tongue prolapse. This procedure involves the insertion of a horseshoe-shaped Kirschner wire, the ends of which are fixed to the posterior mandibular segments, thus acting as a scaffolding for the lacerated soft tissues of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, floor of the mouth and the submandibular region. However, this seems to be a surgical procedure rather than an emergency treatment. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the best emergency treatment to prevent the tongue from falling back in case of facial injuries where voluntary control over the tongue is lost would be the use of an oropharyngeal airway (Choice C). This device is designed to keep the airway open and prevent the tongue from falling back and obstructing the airway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
