    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noise-induced hearing loss is caused by exposure to loud sounds that damage the delicate hearing cells in the ear. These cells are located in the inner ear, specifically in the cochlea. The cochlea contains two types of hair cells: inner hair cells and outer hair cells. Both types of cells play a role in hearing, but they have different functions. Inner hair cells are primarily responsible for sending sound information to the brain, while outer hair cells help amplify the sound. Therefore, damage to either type of cell can result in hearing loss. However, the documents do not specify whether noise-induced hearing loss affects the inner hair cells, the outer hair cells, or both.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Inner hair cell\"}"
