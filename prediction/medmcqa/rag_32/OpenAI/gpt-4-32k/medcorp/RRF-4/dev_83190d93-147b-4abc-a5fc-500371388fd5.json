    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypoxia is a condition in which there is not enough oxygen available to the body's tissues and organs. It is a common sign of respiratory insufficiency as the respiratory system is responsible for oxygenating the blood. Inability to speak can also be a sign of respiratory insufficiency as severe respiratory distress can make it difficult for a person to speak. Stridor during inspiration is a high-pitched, wheezing sound caused by disrupted airflow. Stridor may also indicate a serious condition affecting the throat or larynx (voice box), but it's not typically associated with respiratory insufficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
