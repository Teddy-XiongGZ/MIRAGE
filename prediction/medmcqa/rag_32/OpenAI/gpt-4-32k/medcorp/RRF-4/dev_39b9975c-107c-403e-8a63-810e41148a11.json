    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The free way space is the space between the upper and lower jaws when the muscles are at a relaxed position. If this space is less than normal, it can cause issues with the fit and function of complete dentures. Document [1] suggests that a faulty vertical dimension, which could include a less than normal free way space, is a frequent cause of muscular pain among wearers of full dentures. Document [4] also suggests that a decrease in free way space can affect the balance of the masticatory system. However, none of the documents directly link a less than normal free way space to mucosal irritation, irresistible alveolar ridge resorption, or nonspecific ulcerations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of the above\"}"
