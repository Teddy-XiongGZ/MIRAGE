    "The intercuspal position refers to the position when the upper and lower teeth are in maximum contact, also known as the maximum intercuspation. In this position, the cusps of the upper teeth fit into the grooves and depressions of the lower teeth and vice versa. From the documents, we know that the maxillary second premolar has two cusps (Document 17). The lingual cusp is on the side closer to the tongue. The mandibular second premolar has three cusps, one buccal and two lingual (Document 1). The mandibular first molar is located distally from the mandibular second premolar (Document 20). Given this information, in the intercuspal position, the lingual cusp of the maxillary second premolar would most likely contact the distal fossa of the mandibular second premolar or the mesial fossa of the mandibular first molar. The distal marginal ridge of the mandibular second molar would be too far distally, and the distal marginal ridge of the mandibular first premolar would be too far mesially. Therefore, the answer is either A or B. However, since the mandibular second premolar has three cusps and the mandibular first molar is located distally, it is more likely that the lingual cusp of the maxillary second premolar contacts the distal fossa of the mandibular second premolar. So, the answer is A. Distal fossa of mandibular 2nd premolar.
