    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intraoral radiography is a common dental procedure and reducing radiation exposure to the patient is crucial. From the documents, it is clear that high-speed film (Document 1, Document 30), intensifying screens (Document 1), and lead apron (Document 0) are all methods that can reduce patient radiation exposure. However, decreasing kVp is not mentioned as a method to reduce radiation exposure in any of the documents. In fact, increasing kVp while reducing exposure time can maintain image quality while reducing radiation dose (Document 29). Therefore, decreasing kVp is not a method to reduce patient radiation in intraoral radiography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
