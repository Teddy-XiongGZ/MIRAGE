    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the statement that is not true about RVG. From the documents, we can gather that RVG, or RadioVisioGraphy, is a method used in medical imaging. Document 27 mentions that the RVG system actually generated greater radiation exposure than standard radiography, which contradicts choice A that suggests RVG results in an 80% reduction of patient exposure. The other choices B, C, and D are generally true about digital imaging technologies like RVG. Instant imaging (B) is a feature of digital systems as they don't require film processing. Easy storage and retrieval (C) is also a benefit of digital systems as images can be stored electronically and easily accessed. The image being sharper than those caused by silver halide (D) could also be true as digital imaging can offer higher resolution and image enhancement features.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
