    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Urea cycle disorders are characterized by a deficiency of one of the enzymes in the urea cycle which is responsible for removing ammonia from the blood stream. High levels of ammonia in the blood can be toxic. Therefore, treatment of urea cycle disorders often involves reducing ammonia levels. According to Document [0], sodium benzoate is used to reduce high ammonia levels. Document [1] and [11] mention the use of Ammonul IV, an ammonia scavenger medication. Document [2] and [24] mention the use of ammonia-scavenging drugs, benzoate and phenylacetate (PA)/phenylbutyrate (PB). Document [7] and [15] mention the use of Sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate. Document [9] mentions the use of Arginine, sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium phenylacetate. Document [29] also mentions the use of sodium phenylbutyrate. Therefore, the correct answer is Phenyl butyrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
