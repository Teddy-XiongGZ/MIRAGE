    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proteoglycans are composed of a core protein with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain(s) as stated in Document [23]. This makes option A true. However, the documents do not provide information about GAG containing oxidized acid sugars or negative charges causing to radiate out from the protein. Therefore, I cannot confirm that options B and C are true. As a result, option D which states that all of these are true cannot be correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
