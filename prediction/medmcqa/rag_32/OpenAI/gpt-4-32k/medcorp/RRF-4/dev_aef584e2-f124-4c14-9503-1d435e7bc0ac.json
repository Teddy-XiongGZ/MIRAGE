    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of breathlessness, pruritus, urticaria, and hypotension after taking NSAIDs suggest an allergic reaction, possibly anaphylaxis. In such a case, the initial management would typically include adrenaline, which is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, providing rapid relief from severe allergic symptoms. Oxygen and respiratory support would be necessary to manage breathlessness and ensure adequate oxygenation. Crystalloids infusion would help to manage hypotension. Steroids, while often used in the management of allergic reactions, are not typically part of the initial emergency treatment for anaphylaxis. They have a slower onset of action and are usually used to prevent a late-phase allergic reaction rather than to treat the immediate symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Steroids\"}"
