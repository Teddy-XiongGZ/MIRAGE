    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the least sensitive tissue to radiation exposure. Document [7] mentions that the most radiosensitive organs are bone marrow, lung, stomach, and large bowel. This implies that bone and hematopoietic tissue (found in bone marrow) are sensitive to radiation. Document [11] and [4] suggest that the central nervous system (nerve tissue) is also sensitive to radiation. However, there is no mention of muscle tissue being particularly sensitive to radiation in any of the documents. Therefore, by process of elimination, muscle tissue is likely the least sensitive to radiation exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Muscle\"}"
