    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chromic gut suture is a variant of catgut suture that is treated with chromic acid salts. This treatment extends the full tensile strength and stitch-holding time of the suture to 18\u201321 days, which is roughly twice that of plain gut suture. However, it also causes greater tissue inflammation. Therefore, the advantage of chromic gut over plain gut suture in deep wounds is its delayed resorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
