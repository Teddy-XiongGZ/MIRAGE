    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fetal adrenal gland is known to produce a variety of hormones. However, the question asks for the predominant hormone. From the documents, it is clear that the fetal adrenal gland produces large amounts of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), an androgen and precursor of both androgens and estrogens (female sex hormones). However, none of the options provided in the question match DHEA-S. Among the given options, the closest match would be testosterone, which is an androgen. Although the fetal adrenal gland does not predominantly produce testosterone, it is a byproduct of the conversion of DHEA-S.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
