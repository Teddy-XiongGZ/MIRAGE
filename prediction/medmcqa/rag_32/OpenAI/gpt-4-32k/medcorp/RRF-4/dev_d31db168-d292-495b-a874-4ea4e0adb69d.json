    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the shape of the lower 2nd molar. None of the documents provided directly describe the shape of the lower 2nd molar. However, Document [10] describes the shape of the mandibular first molar as having five well-developed cusps and being 'M' shaped. This might suggest that the second molar could have a similar shape, but it's not definitive. Without more specific information, it's impossible to definitively answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
