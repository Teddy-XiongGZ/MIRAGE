    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactose intolerance is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. When lactose isn't properly digested, it can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and gas. All the options provided are dairy products and contain lactose.
