    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulp mummification is a treatment method used for teeth with pulpitis, as mentioned in Document [0]. However, it is not indicated for a non-vital tooth, as the pulp in such a tooth is already dead or dying. Similarly, it is not suitable for a tooth with deep caries that is symptomatic, as the pulp in such a tooth is likely already infected or inflamed beyond the point of no return, as mentioned in Document [25]. Traumatic exposure of a vital tooth could potentially be a candidate for pulp mummification, but the condition of the tooth's apex is also a crucial factor.
