    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has massive blood loss, so it's crucial to replace the lost blood volume as quickly as possible to prevent shock and organ failure. PRBCs are used to increase oxygen-carrying capacity and improve tissue oxygenation, which is critical in this situation. Platelets are used to help with clotting and prevent further bleeding, but they are not as immediately critical as restoring blood volume and oxygen-carrying capacity. Platelets can be stored at room temperature for a short period of time without significant loss of function. Therefore, it would be best to start the PRBC transfusion first and store the platelets at room temperature until they can be transfused.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
