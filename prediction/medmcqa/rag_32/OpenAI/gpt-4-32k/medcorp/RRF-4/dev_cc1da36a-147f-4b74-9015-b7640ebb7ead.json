    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lobar hemorrhage refers to bleeding in the brain that is confined to a particular lobe. In the elderly, the most common cause of lobar hemorrhage is cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). This is supported by multiple documents, such as Document [1], which states that CAA contributes to sporadic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in older patients, especially those who are more than 70 years old. Document [12] also mentions that CAA is a frequent cause of lobar hemorrhage in the elderly. Document [29] further supports this, stating that CAA is a common pathological finding in the elderly and has a significant association with pure superficial (lobar) cerebral haemorrhages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Amyloid angiopathy\"}"
