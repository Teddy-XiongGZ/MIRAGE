    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The spring back property of a material refers to its ability to return to its original shape after deformation. Superelastic NiTi wires are known for their excellent spring back properties due to their unique ability to undergo large deformations and then return to their original shape. This is a characteristic of their superelasticity. On the other hand, non-superelastic NiTi wires do not have this superelastic property, and therefore, their spring back is expected to be less than that of superelastic NiTi wires.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
