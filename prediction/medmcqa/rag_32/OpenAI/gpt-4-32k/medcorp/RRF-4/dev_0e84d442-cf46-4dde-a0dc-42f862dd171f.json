    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrates are used in the treatment of angina. According to the documents, nitrates work by causing vasodilation, which can help to relieve the symptoms of angina. This vasodilation can occur in both the coronary arteries and the systemic circulation. In the coronary arteries, this can help to increase blood flow to the heart muscle, reducing the symptoms of angina. In the systemic circulation, vasodilation can help to reduce the workload of the heart by decreasing preload, which is the amount of blood that the heart has to pump with each beat. Therefore, the major mechanism of action of nitrates in an acute attack of angina is by decreasing preload.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
