    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case of an 8-year-old child with a fractured maxillary central incisor that occurred 10 months ago. The pulp shows no response, indicating pulp necrosis, and there is no periapical lesion in the radiograph. Given the age of the child, the tooth is likely to be immature with an open apex. Therefore, the treatment of choice would be to debride the necrotic pulp tissue and promote the formation of an apical barrier, a process known as apexification. Calcium hydroxide has traditionally been used for apexification, but the question does not specify the use of this material. Pulp capping and pulpotomy are not suitable because the pulp is non-responsive, indicating it is not vital. Conventional root canal treatment is not suitable for teeth with open apices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
