    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the metal alloy that reduces the hardness of orthodontic wires. Looking at the documents, there is no direct mention of a metal alloy reducing the hardness of orthodontic wires. However, we can infer from the documents that different alloys can affect the hardness of the wires. For example, Document 1 mentions that Blue Elgiloy (BE) shows decreased forces in 1mm loading compared to stainless steel, and higher than TMA. This suggests that the addition of certain elements to the alloy can affect its hardness. However, none of the documents mention Chromium, Cobalt, Silicon, or Carbon specifically reducing the hardness of orthodontic wires. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it is not possible to definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
