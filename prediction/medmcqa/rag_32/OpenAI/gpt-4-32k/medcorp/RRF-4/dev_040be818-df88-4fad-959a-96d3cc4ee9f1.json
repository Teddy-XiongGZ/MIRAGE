    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Streptococci, specifically Streptococcus mutans, are known to contribute to dental caries. Looking at the options, penicillinase resistance is not relevant to caries development. Fermentation of carbohydrates by Streptococcus mutans does occur and results in acid production, which can lead to tooth decay. However, this is a more general characteristic of many bacteria, not just streptococci. The production of extracellular polysaccharides, specifically glucans, is a key feature of Streptococcus mutans. These glucans allow the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and form a biofilm, which is a critical step in the development of dental caries. Therefore, the production of extracellular polysaccharides is the most specific and direct way that streptococci contribute to caries development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
