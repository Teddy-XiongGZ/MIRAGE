    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the situation where complete denture teeth are in edge to edge contact in centric occlusion. Centric occlusion refers to the maximum contact between the occluding surfaces of the upper and lower teeth. In this situation, the teeth are not properly aligned and adjustments need to be made. The options provided suggest different ways of grinding the teeth to correct the issue. The goal is to adjust the teeth in a way that allows for proper occlusion and comfortable function. The correct approach would be to grind the cusp in such a way that the incline of the upper cusp slides lingually and lower cusp slides buccally. This would allow for proper alignment and occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
