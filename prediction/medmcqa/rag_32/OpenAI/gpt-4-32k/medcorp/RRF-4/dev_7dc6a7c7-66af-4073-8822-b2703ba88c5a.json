    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aortic stenosis is characterized by the narrowing of the aortic valve, which restricts blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. According to Document [23], a systolic ejection murmur can often be heard best over the right sternal border at the second intercostal space in aortic stenosis. This murmur peaks later during systole as the disease severity increases. A delayed carotid upstroke is also a physical sign of aortic stenosis as mentioned in Document [4]. A diastolic rumble is not a characteristic of aortic stenosis, but rather of mitral stenosis. An opening snap is also associated with mitral stenosis, not aortic stenosis. Therefore, the correct answer is a delayed carotid upstroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
