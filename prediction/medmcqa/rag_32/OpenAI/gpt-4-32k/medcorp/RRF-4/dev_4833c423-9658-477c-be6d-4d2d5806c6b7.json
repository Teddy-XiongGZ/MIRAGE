    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Brittle bone syndrome, also known as osteogenesis imperfecta, is mentioned in several documents. Document [0] introduces the disease but does not provide information about its cause. Document [1] suggests that osteogenesis imperfecta is a syndrome of congenital brittle bones secondary to mutations in the genes codifying for pro-collagen genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2). Document [2] also mentions that the brittle bone syndrome results from a variety of mutations in the alpha chains of type I collagen. Document [17] further explains that in most cases, there is a reduction in the production of normal type I collagen or the synthesis of abnormal collagen as a result of mutations in the type I collagen genes. Therefore, the cause of brittle bone syndrome is related to the improper synthesis of procollagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
