    "The question is asking about the clinical manifestations of severe aortic stenosis (AS). To answer this question, I need to find information in the provided documents that describes the physical signs or symptoms associated with severe AS. Looking at the documents, Document [1] titled \"Comparison between characteristics of severe and very severe aortic stenosis\" seems to be the most relevant. This document discusses the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of patients with severe and very severe AS. However, it does not mention any of the specific signs listed in the answer choices (Pulsus bisferiens, Late ejection systolic click, Heaving shifted apex, Loud S2). None of the other documents seem to contain relevant information about the physical signs of severe AS. Therefore, based on the provided documents, I cannot definitively choose an answer. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the physical signs of severe aortic stenosis.
