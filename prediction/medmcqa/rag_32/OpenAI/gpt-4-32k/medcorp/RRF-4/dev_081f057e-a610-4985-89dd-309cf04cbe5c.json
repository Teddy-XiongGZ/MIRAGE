    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nociceptive signals are transmitted from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. The documents mention that these signals are transmitted to the spinal cord and then to the brain. The limbic system is involved in emotional responses, which is not the primary destination for nociceptive signals. The superior cervical ganglion is part of the sympathetic nervous system, which is not the primary pathway for nociceptive signals. The reticular system is involved in consciousness and alertness, not primarily in pain transmission. The nucleus caudalis, also known as the spinal trigeminal nucleus, is a part of the brainstem that is involved in the transmission of pain and temperature sensations from the face, so it is the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
