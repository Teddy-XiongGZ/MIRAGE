    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it's asking. The question is asking which statement is true for rapid prototyping. Step 2: Review the answer choices. The choices are about different methods of rapid prototyping: Photopolymer resin cures with laser, Powder by fused deposition modeling, Selective laser sintering, and All of the above. Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [15] mentions various rapid prototyping methods including stereolithography, selective laser sintering, direct laser metal sintering, two-photon polymerization, laminated object manufacturing, three-dimensional printing, three-dimensional plotting, polyjet inkjet technology, fused deposition modelling, vacuum casting and milling. Step 4: Match the information from the documents to the answer choices. From Document [15], we know that stereolithography, selective laser sintering, and fused deposition modeling are all methods of rapid prototyping. Step 5: Choose the correct answer. Since all the methods mentioned in the choices are part of rapid prototyping, the correct answer is \"All of the above\". The final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which statement is true for rapid prototyping.
