    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 50-year-old smoker who presents with dyspnea and palpitations. These symptoms could be indicative of a cardiac issue. The ECG would help to identify the specific cardiac issue. Atrial fibrillation could present with these symptoms and would show an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG. Multifocal atrial tachycardia could also present with these symptoms and would show multiple P wave morphologies on ECG. AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia could present with palpitations and would show a narrow complex tachycardia on ECG. Monomorphic VT could present with these symptoms and would show a wide complex tachycardia on ECG. However, without the specific ECG findings, it is impossible to definitively choose one of these options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"E\"}"
