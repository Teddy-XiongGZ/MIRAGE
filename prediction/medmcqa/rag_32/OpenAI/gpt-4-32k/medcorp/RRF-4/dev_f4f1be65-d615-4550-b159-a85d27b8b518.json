    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Saliva is first produced in the acinar lumen of the salivary glands and then altered into a mixture of electrolytes and macromolecules as it is actively transported through the ducts. The sodium gets actively reabsorbed, potassium is actively secreted, chloride is passively absorbed, and bicarbonate secreted. The ductal epithelium has poor water permeability. The final saliva product will be hypotonic. Therefore, the saliva becomes hypotonic as compared to plasma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Hypotonic\"}"
