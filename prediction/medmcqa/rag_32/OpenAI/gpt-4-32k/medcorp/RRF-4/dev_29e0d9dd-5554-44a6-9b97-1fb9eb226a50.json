    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ectopic pregnancy is when the fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. The survival of an ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube depends on the location within the tube. According to Document [0], the majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the ampullary section of the fallopian tube. However, the document also mentions that mortality of a tubal pregnancy at the isthmus or within the uterus (interstitial pregnancy) is higher as there is increased vascularity that may result more likely in sudden major internal bleeding. This suggests that ectopic pregnancies in the isthmus or interstitium may survive longer because of the increased blood supply.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Isthmus\"}"
