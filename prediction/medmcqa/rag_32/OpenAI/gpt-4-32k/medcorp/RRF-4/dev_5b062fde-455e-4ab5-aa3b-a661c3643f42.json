    "The Doctrine of Borrowed Servant refers to a legal principle where an employer lends an employee to someone else, and during that period, the employee becomes the 'borrowed servant' of the person to whom they are lent. In the context of healthcare, this doctrine often applies when a nurse or other healthcare professional assists a doctor during a procedure. The doctor, in this case, becomes the 'borrowing employer' and may be held liable for the actions of the 'borrowed servant'. Step 1: Review the options in relation to the Doctrine of Borrowed Servant. Step 2: Option A suggests that hospital administration is responsible for the actions of interns and trainees. This is generally true as interns and trainees are under the direct supervision of the hospital administration. Step 3: Option B states that a nurse assisting a surgery is a borrowed servant of the hospital. This is also true as per the doctrine, the nurse becomes a borrowed servant of the surgeon during the procedure. Step 4: Option C suggests that a doctor assisting a surgeon for a fee in the operating theatre is a borrowed servant. This is also true as the assisting doctor becomes a borrowed servant of the surgeon during the procedure. Step 5: Option D states that a physician is responsible for the acts of the orderlies and nursing staff done by his orders. This is not necessarily true as per the Doctrine of Borrowed Servant.
