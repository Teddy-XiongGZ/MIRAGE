    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-visualization of the gallbladder in hepatic scintigraphy can be indicative of several conditions. However, according to Document [6], all patients with acute cholecystitis had non-visualization of the gallbladder on scintigraphy. Document [9] also supports this, stating that all patients in whom the gallbladder was not visualized by cholescintigraphy had cholecystitis. Document [14] also indicates that acute cholecystitis can be excluded by the findings of gallbladder visualization in hepatobiliary scintigram, implying that non-visualization suggests the presence of acute cholecystitis. Therefore, the most likely answer is acute cholecystitis due to gallstones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Acute cholecystitis due to gallstones\"}"
