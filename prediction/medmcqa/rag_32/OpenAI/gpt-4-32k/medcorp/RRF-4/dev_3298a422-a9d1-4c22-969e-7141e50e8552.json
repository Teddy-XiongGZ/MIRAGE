    "The question is asking about the muscle that limits the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression for a complete denture. Looking at the documents, Document [27] mentions that the posterior part of the alveolingual sulcus (the retromylohyoid fossa) divides into two parts: anteroinferior and posterosuperior. The lingual flange of the mandibular denture should be turned into the anteroinferior part to produce maximum stability for the denture since no muscle lies directly underneath. However, this document does not mention any specific muscle that limits the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression. Document [12] mentions that the extension of the flange in the sublingual crescent region is an important factor for mandibular denture stability and retention. Making the impression with minimal pressure on the floor of the mouth while the tongue is at rest allows greater mobility of the underlying muscles without denture dislodgment and without occlusion of the sublingual gland ducts. Again, this document does not mention any specific muscle that limits the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression. None of the documents provided mention the specific muscles listed in the answer choices (Stylohyoid, Medial pterygoid, Lateral pterygoid, Superior constrictor) as limiting the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression for a complete denture. However, based on anatomical knowledge, the Superior Constrictor muscle is a muscle of the pharynx and is responsible for the constriction of the pharynx during swallowing. It is located in the posterior part of the oral cavity, which is where the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression would be. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the Superior Constrictor muscle could limit the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression for a complete denture. Therefore, the answer is D. Superior constrictor muscle. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the muscle that limits the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression for a complete denture.
