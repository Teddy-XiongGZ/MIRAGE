    "First, let's define the terms: - Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives and the number of false negatives. - Specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate), calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives and the number of false positives. Given the data: - Diseased and Test Positive (True Positives, TP) = 27 - Diseased and Test Negative (False Negatives, FN) = 3 - Non-diseased and Test Positive (False Positives, FP) = 5 - Non-diseased and Test Negative (True Negatives, TN) = 95 We can calculate sensitivity and specificity as follows: - Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 27 / (27 + 3) = 0.90 = 90% - Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 95 / (95 + 5) = 0.95 = 95% So, the sensitivity of the test is 90% and the specificity is 95%. Therefore, the answer is: A. Sensitivity 90% Specificity 95% The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I defined the terms sensitivity and specificity. Then, I used the given data to calculate the sensitivity (the ability of the test to correctly identify those with the disease) and specificity (the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease). The calculations showed that the sensitivity of the test is 90% and the specificity is 95%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
