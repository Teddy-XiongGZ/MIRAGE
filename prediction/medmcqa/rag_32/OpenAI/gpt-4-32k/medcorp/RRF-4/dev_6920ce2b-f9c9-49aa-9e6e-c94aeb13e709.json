    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pituitary gland influences many endocrine glands through the hormones it secretes. For example, the thyroid gland is influenced by the pituitary gland through the secretion of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). The adrenal cortex is influenced by the pituitary gland through the secretion of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH). The ovaries and testes are influenced by the pituitary gland through the secretion of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH). However, the adrenal medulla, parathyroids, and the islets of Langerhans (in the pancreas) are not directly influenced by the pituitary gland. The adrenal medulla is part of the adrenal gland but it is influenced by the nervous system, not the pituitary gland. The parathyroids secrete parathyroid hormone in response to low blood calcium levels, not in response to pituitary hormones. The islets of Langerhans in the pancreas secrete insulin and glucagon in response to blood glucose levels, not in response to pituitary hormones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Adrenal medulla, parathyroids, and the islets of langerhans\"}"
