    "First, I will review the documents to understand what topical hemostatic agents are and how they work. Then, I will look for information about each of the options provided in the question to determine which one is not a topical hemostatic agent. From Document [0], I understand that topical hemostatic agents are used to accelerate the clotting process during surgery. They encompass a range of products, including pharmacotherapies, sealants, adhesives, absorbable agents, biologics, and combination products. Now, I will look for information about each of the options: A. Bone wax & patty - I did not find any specific mention of \"Bone wax & patty\" in the documents as a topical hemostatic agent. B. HemCon bandage - Again, I did not find any specific mention of \"HemCon bandage\" in the documents as a topical hemostatic agent. C. Quikclot - I did not find any specific mention of \"Quikclot\" in the documents as a topical hemostatic agent. D. Fixclot - I did not find any specific mention of \"Fixclot\" in the documents as a topical hemostatic agent. Since none of the options were specifically mentioned in the documents as topical hemostatic agents, I will need to use my medical knowledge to answer this question. Bone wax is a non-absorbable, mechanical hemostatic agent used in surgery to control bleeding from bone surfaces. It is not a topical hemostatic agent in the traditional sense as it does not actively participate in the clotting process. HemCon bandage, Quikclot, and Fixclot are all topical hemostatic agents that are used to control bleeding. HemCon bandage and Quikclot are commonly used in emergency and military medicine, while Fixclot is a fibrin sealant used in surgical procedures. Therefore, the answer is A. Bone wax & patty.
