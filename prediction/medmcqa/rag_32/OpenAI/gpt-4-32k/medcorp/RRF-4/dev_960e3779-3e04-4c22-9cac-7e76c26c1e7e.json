    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute mountain sickness is a condition that can occur when people ascend to high altitudes too quickly. According to the documents, both Acetazolamide and Dexamethasone are used for the prevention of acute mountain sickness. However, the question asks for a single drug, so I need to determine which one is more commonly used or recommended. Document [0] states that Acetazolamide at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily are all more effective than placebo for preventing acute mountain sickness. Document [1] also mentions Acetazolamide as a useful prophylactic for acute mountain sickness. Document [13] mentions that Acetazolamide is effective for the prevention of acute mountain sickness. On the other hand, Dexamethasone is mentioned in Document [12] and Document [16] as a treatment for severe cases of altitude sickness and acute cerebral edema, but it is not specifically mentioned as a preventive measure for acute mountain sickness. Therefore, based on the information provided, Acetazolamide is the drug given to prevent acute mountain sickness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
