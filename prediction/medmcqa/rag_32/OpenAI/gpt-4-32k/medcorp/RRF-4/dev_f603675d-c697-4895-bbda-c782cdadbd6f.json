    "First, I will look for information about glucocorticoid deficiency in the provided documents. Document [26] provides some information about familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), stating that it is characterized by elevated ACTH and low serum morning cortisol level. Clinical symptoms of FGD are due to glucocorticoid deficiency and include skin hyperpigmentation, failure to thrive, and hypoglycemia. Document [30] also mentions glucocorticoid deficiency, stating that the clinical manifestations of inadequate adrenal function result from inadequate secretion or action of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, or both. From these documents, we can infer that glucocorticoid deficiency can lead to symptoms such as failure to thrive (which could be interpreted as weight loss), and hypoglycemia. However, there is no mention of fever, hyperkalemia, or postural hypotension as symptoms of glucocorticoid deficiency. Therefore, I will need to look at each answer choice individually to determine which is not a feature of glucocorticoid deficiency: A. Fever - There is no mention of fever as a symptom of glucocorticoid deficiency in the provided documents. B. Hyperkalemia - There is no mention of hyperkalemia as a symptom of glucocorticoid deficiency in the provided documents. C. Postural hypotension - There is no mention of postural hypotension as a symptom of glucocorticoid deficiency in the provided documents. D. Weight loss - Failure to thrive, which could be interpreted as weight loss, is mentioned as a symptom of glucocorticoid deficiency in Document [26]. Based on this analysis, the answer is A. Fever, as it is not mentioned as a symptom of glucocorticoid deficiency in the provided documents. So, the final output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first looked for information about glucocorticoid deficiency in the provided documents.
