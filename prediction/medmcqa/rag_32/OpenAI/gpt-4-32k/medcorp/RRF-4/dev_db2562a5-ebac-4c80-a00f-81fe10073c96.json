    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most common developmental cyst. Looking at the documents, Document [1] mentions that the Nasopalatine duct cyst is the most common developmental jaw cyst. However, the question is not specific to the jaw, so we need to consider all types of developmental cysts. Document [30] mentions that the most common odontogenic cyst is a follicular (dentigerous) cyst, but this is not one of the options. None of the other documents provide information about the prevalence of the other cysts listed in the options. Therefore, based on the available information, the Nasopalatine cyst seems to be the most common among the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
