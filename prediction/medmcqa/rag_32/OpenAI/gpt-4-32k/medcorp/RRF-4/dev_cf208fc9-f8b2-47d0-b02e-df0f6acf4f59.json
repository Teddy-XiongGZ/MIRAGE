    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that the dental pulp is innervated by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, which is related to blood vessel constriction within the dental pulp. There is no evidence for a parasympathetic pulpal innervation. Therefore, the nerve fibers in the pulp are not parasympathetic post ganglionic or both autonomic parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers. The documents do not mention motor fibers in the pulp. Therefore, the nerve fibers in the pulp are sympathetic efferent post ganglionic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
