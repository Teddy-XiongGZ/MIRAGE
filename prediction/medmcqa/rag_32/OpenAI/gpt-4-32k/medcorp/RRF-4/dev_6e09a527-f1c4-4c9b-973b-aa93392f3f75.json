    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the relationship between the primary target of a drug and its secondary targets, which are usually proteins. The documents suggest that adverse events can occur when a drug binds to unexpected proteins, receptors, or enzymes that can alter different pathways other than those desired for treatment. This suggests that the secondary target does not necessarily need to be present in the same tissue as the primary target, nor does it need to have identical secondary or primary structures. However, the secondary target should have similar binding sites to the primary target, as this would allow the drug to bind and potentially cause adverse effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
