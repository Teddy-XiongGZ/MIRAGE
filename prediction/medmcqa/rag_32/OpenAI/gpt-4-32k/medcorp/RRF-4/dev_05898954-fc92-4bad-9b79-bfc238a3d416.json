    "First, I need to understand what special visceral afferent fibers are. From Document [0], I learned that special visceral afferent fibers (SVA) are a type of afferent fiber that develop in association with the gastrointestinal tract. They carry the special senses of smell (olfaction) and taste (gustation). The cranial nerves containing SVA fibers are the olfactory nerve (I), the facial nerve (VII), the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), and the vagus nerve (X). Next, I need to find out where these fibers are located in the facial nerve. From Document [1], I learned that the axons of type SVA, special visceral afferent, provide taste to the anterior two-thirds of tongue via chorda tympani. Finally, I need to find out which nucleus these fibers are located in. From Document [11], I learned that the special visceral afferent (SVA) component carries information about taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Its fibers travel with the lingual nerve and the chorda tympani. The primary neurons are in the geniculate ganglion \u2013 at the genu of the facial nerve. The fibers enter the brain via the intermediate nerve and terminate at the ipsilateral nucleus of the solitary tract in the rostral medulla. Therefore, the special visceral afferent fibers of the facial nerve are located in the nucleus of the solitary tract. So, the answer is C. Nucleus of tractus solitarius.
