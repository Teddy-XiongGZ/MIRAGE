    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanism by which a phage (a type of virus that infects bacteria) can cause changes in Corynebacterium diphtheriae. This process is known as transduction, where the phage transfers genetic material from one bacterium to another. This is different from conjugation, which is a direct transfer of DNA between two bacterial cells, and transformation, which involves the uptake of DNA from the environment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
