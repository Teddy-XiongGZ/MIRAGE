    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cushing's syndrome is characterized by an excess of cortisol in the body. This can be due to various reasons such as a pituitary tumor (Cushing's disease), ectopic ACTH production, or adrenal tumors. The earliest manifestation of Cushing's syndrome would be the primary cause of the cortisol excess. In this case, it would be an increase in ACTH, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol into the bloodstream. This would then lead to an increase in plasma cortisol and urinary metabolites of cortisol. Loss of diurnal variation is a result of the constant high levels of cortisol, which normally fluctuate throughout the day.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
