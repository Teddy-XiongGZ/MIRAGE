    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has undergone breast conservation therapy and chemotherapy for ER positive breast cancer with one positive axillary lymph node. She is currently on tamoxifen. The follow-up for such a patient would typically involve regular clinical examinations to monitor for any signs of recurrence or new developments. This is usually done more frequently in the first year after treatment, as this is the period with the highest risk of recurrence. An annual mammogram is also recommended to monitor for any changes in the breast tissue that could indicate a recurrence. Routine bone scans and liver function tests are not typically part of the standard follow-up unless there are specific symptoms or concerns. Assessment of tumor markers is also not typically done routinely as it has not been shown to improve survival or detect recurrence earlier in asymptomatic patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
