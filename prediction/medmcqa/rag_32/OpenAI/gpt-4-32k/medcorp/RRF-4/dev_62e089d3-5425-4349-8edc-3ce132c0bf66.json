    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA replication and transcription both occur in the 5' to 3' direction, as the polymerase enzymes involved in these processes synthesize new strands of DNA or RNA in this direction. DNA repair also occurs in the 5' to 3' direction, as the repair enzymes move along the DNA strand in this direction to correct errors. However, RNA editing does not necessarily occur in the 5' to 3' direction. RNA editing can occur at any position within the RNA molecule, and does not involve a processive movement along the RNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. RNA editing\"}"
