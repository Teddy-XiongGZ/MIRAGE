    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include headache, blurred vision, and diplopia (double vision) when looking to the left with the right eye. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is a disorder of conjugate lateral gaze in which the affected eye shows impairment of adduction. When an attempt is made to gaze contralaterally (relative to the affected eye), the affected eye adducts minimally, if at all. The contralateral eye abducts, however with nystagmus. INO occurs commonly due to lesions (like multiple sclerosis or stroke) in the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the brainstem. The symptoms of the patient align with this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
