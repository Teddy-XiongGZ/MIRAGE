    "Based on the information provided in the documents, we can see that both prolactin and growth hormone (GH) are under the inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. Document [0] mentions that prolactin inhibiting hormone (dopamine) inhibits PRL (prolactin) secretion. This indicates that the hypothalamus has an inhibitory control over prolactin. Document [30] also mentions that dopamine inhibits the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary, further confirming the inhibitory control of the hypothalamus over prolactin. Regarding growth hormone (GH), Document [31] mentions that the secretion of growth hormone is controlled by two neuroendocrine systems: the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) neurons and the somatostatin neurons, which stimulate and inhibit GH secretion, respectively. This indicates that the hypothalamus has an inhibitory control over GH as well. Therefore, the answer is D. Both GH and prolactin. { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I looked for information about the inhibitory control of the hypothalamus over prolactin and found it in Document [0] and Document [30]. Then, I searched for information about the inhibitory control of the hypothalamus over GH and found it in Document [31]. Therefore, the hypothalamus has inhibitory control over both prolactin and GH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
