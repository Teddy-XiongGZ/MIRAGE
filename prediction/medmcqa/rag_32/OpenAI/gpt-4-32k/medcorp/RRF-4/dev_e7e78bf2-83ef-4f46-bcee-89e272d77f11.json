    "The documents provided do not contain specific information about the role of the lateral pterygoid or medial pterygoid muscles in lateral movement of the condyle. Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer cannot be definitively determined. However, in general anatomy and physiology, the lateral pterygoid muscle is known to be involved in the lateral movement of the mandible. The lateral pterygoid has two heads - superior and inferior. The inferior head is primarily responsible for protrusion and lateral movement of the mandible. When the lateral pterygoid muscles on both sides contract together, they pull the condyle forward, causing the jaw to protrude. When the lateral pterygoid muscle on one side contracts, it pulls the condyle on that side forward and to the opposite side, causing the jaw to move laterally. Given this general knowledge, the answer would likely be \"B. Ipsilateral lateral pterygoid\". However, this answer is based on general anatomical knowledge and not on the provided documents. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide specific information about the role of the lateral or medial pterygoid muscles in lateral movement of the condyle.
