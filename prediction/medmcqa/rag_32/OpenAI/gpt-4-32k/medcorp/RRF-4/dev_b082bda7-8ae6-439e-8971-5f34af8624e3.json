    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not contain information about cerebral blood flow during exercise, so I can't confirm option A. Similarly, there is no information about body temperature changes during exercise, so option B can't be confirmed either. Option D is about lymphatic flow from muscle during exercise, but the documents do not provide any information about this. However, option C states that blood flow to muscle increases after 1\u00bd minute. While the documents do not specify the exact timing, they do mention that blood flow improves during exercise, particularly dynamic exercises like running (Document [0]). Therefore, option C seems to be the most plausible answer based on the information provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
