    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], a dose of 125 micrograms of anti-D is given in the third trimester. Document [2] also mentions prophylactic anti-D as a therapy for the suppression of anti-D immunization. Document [4] suggests that additional anti-D prophylaxis during pregnancy, starting at 28 weeks, can reduce alloimmunization to a minimum. Document [5] suggests that the preparation of anti-D immunoglobulin used in pregnancy week 28-30 is associated with detectable levels of anti-D in most women at the time of delivery. Document [21] states that anti-D immune globulin is given prophylactically to all D-negative, unsensitized women at approximately 28 weeks' gestation, and a second dose is given after delivery if the newborn is D-positive. Therefore, the best time to give anti-D to a pregnant patient is at 28 weeks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
