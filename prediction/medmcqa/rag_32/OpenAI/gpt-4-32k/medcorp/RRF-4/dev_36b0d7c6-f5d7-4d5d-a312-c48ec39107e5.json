    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation causes cell death by damaging the DNA of the cell, which can occur directly or indirectly. Direct damage occurs when the radiation interacts and transfers its energy directly to the cell's DNA, causing single-stranded or double-stranded breaks or chromosomal damage. Indirect damage occurs through the formation of free radicals produced through ionization of surrounding water. This mechanism is present in about two-thirds of all radiation-induced cell damage. Therefore, the answer is ionization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
