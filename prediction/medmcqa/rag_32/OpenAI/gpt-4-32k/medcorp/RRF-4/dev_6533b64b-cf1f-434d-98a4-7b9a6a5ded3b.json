    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The upper denture falling when the patient opens his mouth wide could be due to a number of factors. However, the options provided are specific to the structure of the denture itself. A thick labial flange or a thick disto-buccal flange could potentially cause discomfort or misalignment, but they are not likely to cause the denture to fall out when the mouth is opened wide. Over-extended borders could potentially cause the denture to be unstable and thus more likely to fall out when the mouth is opened wide. A poor peripheral seal could also cause instability and make the denture more likely to fall out. However, the seal is more related to the fit of the denture against the gums and the roof of the mouth, and a poor seal would likely cause the denture to be unstable in general, not just when the mouth is opened wide. Therefore, the most likely cause given the options is over-extended borders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
