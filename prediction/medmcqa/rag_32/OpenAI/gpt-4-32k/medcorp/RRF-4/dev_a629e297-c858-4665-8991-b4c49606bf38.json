    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the treatment of infected mandibular angle fractures. Document [26] mentions that infected mandible fractures were treated with incision and drainage, culture and sensitivity testing, extraction of nonsalvageable teeth, placement of maxillomandibular fixation when possible, fracture reduction with bone debridement and decortication, rigid internal fixation of the mandible by an extraoral approach, and antibiotic therapy. This suggests that a combination of methods is used to treat infected mandibular angle fractures. However, none of the documents specifically mention the use of mini plates, reconstruction plates, or Champy plates in the context of infected fractures. Document [26] does mention the use of rigid internal fixation, which could potentially include the use of plates, but it does not specify which type. Document [18] mentions the use of two noncompression miniplates for treatment of mandibular angle fractures, but it does not specify if this is for infected fractures. Therefore, based on the available documents, the most accurate answer seems to be IMF + ID, which stands for intermaxillary fixation and incision and drainage, as these are mentioned in the context of treating infected mandibular angle fractures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
