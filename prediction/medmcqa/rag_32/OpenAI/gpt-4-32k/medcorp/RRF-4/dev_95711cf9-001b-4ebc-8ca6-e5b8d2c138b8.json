    "The question asks about the blood supply to the dura mater. The relevant information can be found in Document [10] which states that \"The arterial blood supply to the dura mater is rich, complex and is derived from both the internal and external carotid systems.\" However, the document does not provide specific information about the arteries mentioned in the answer choices. To answer this question, we need to rely on general medical knowledge. The middle meningeal artery, meningeal branch of the internal carotid artery, and the accessory meningeal artery are known to supply the dura mater. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries primarily supply the nasal cavity and adjacent structures, not the dura mater. Therefore, the answer is C. Anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the blood supply to the dura mater.
