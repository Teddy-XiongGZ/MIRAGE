    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The posterior pituitary gland does not synthesize hormones, but it does store and release two hormones: antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin. Therefore, after resection of the posterior pituitary, there would be no need to replace these hormones. Glucagon, thyroxine, estradiol, and mineralocorticoids are not stored or released by the posterior pituitary. They are produced by other endocrine glands: glucagon by the pancreas, thyroxine by the thyroid gland, estradiol by the ovaries, and mineralocorticoids by the adrenal glands. Therefore, none of these hormones would need to be replaced after resection of the posterior pituitary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Glucagon\"}"
