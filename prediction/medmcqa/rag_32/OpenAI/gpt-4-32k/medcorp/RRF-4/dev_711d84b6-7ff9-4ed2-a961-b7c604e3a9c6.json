    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the additive that can decrease the setting time of pro-root MTA. From Document [14], it is mentioned that the addition of dentin powder can decrease the setting time of MTA. However, this option is not provided in the choices. Document [26] mentions that a 5 wt% silk fibroin solution can decrease the setting time of MTA, but this option is also not provided in the choices. Document [21] mentions that the addition of disodium hydrogen phosphate (DHP) to MTA can increase its pH and calcium ion release, but it also prevented the setting of the material, so this is not the correct answer. Document [8] mentions that the addition of 8% and 10% of nano-SiO2 to MTA can reduce the setting time, but this option is not provided in the choices. Finally, Document [0] mentions that an admix of 1% methylcellulose and 2% calcium chloride resulted in a mix of chemically modified MTA that set one third faster. Therefore, the correct answer is 5% CaCl.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
