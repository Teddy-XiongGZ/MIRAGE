    "The infant mortality rate is calculated as the number of deaths of infants under one year old in a year per 1,000 live births during the same year. Step 1: Calculate the number of live births. The number of live births is the total births minus the births that showed no signs of life. So, 456 (total births) - 56 (births with no signs of life) = 400 live births. Step 2: Calculate the number of infant deaths. Infant deaths include deaths before 28 days of life and deaths between 28 days and 1 year. So, 56 (deaths before 28 days) + 34 (deaths between 28 days and 1 year) = 90 infant deaths. Step 3: Calculate the infant mortality rate. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births. So, (90 infant deaths / 400 live births) * 1000 = 225. Therefore, the infant mortality rate is 225 per 1,000 live births. So, the answer is C. 225. Output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Calculate the number of live births.
