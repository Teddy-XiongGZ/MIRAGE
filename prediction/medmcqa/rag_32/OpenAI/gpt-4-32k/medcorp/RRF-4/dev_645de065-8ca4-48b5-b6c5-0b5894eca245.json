    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention several essential fatty acids present in breast milk, including linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. However, the question asks for the essential fatty acid that is required for the normal growth of a child. Document [0] mentions that breast milk is rich in linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. Document [1] also mentions that fatty acids are important for growth and development. Document [23] mentions that linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid are precursors of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), including arachidonic (20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic (22:6n-3) acids (AA and DHA). These LC-PUFAs serve as indispensable structural components of cellular membranes and are deposited to a considerable extent in the growing brain and the retina during perinatal development. Therefore, all these fatty acids are essential for the normal growth of a child. However, among the given options, only linoleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are mentioned in the documents. Between these two, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is specifically mentioned in several documents as being important for brain and retina development, which are crucial aspects of a child's growth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Docosahexanoic acid\"}"
