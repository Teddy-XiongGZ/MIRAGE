    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hypothalamus regulates the secretion of various hormones by releasing inhibitory or stimulatory hormones. According to Document [19], the hypothalamus uses dopamine as a prolactostatin to inhibit the secretion of prolactin. Document [27] mentions that somatostatin, a hormone released by the hypothalamus, inhibits the actions of Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone, which controls the release of Growth Hormone. Therefore, both prolactin and growth hormone are under the inhibitory control of the hypothalamus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Both prolactin and growth hormone\"}"
