    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [1], if the fracture gap is 800 \u03bcm to 1 mm, the fracture is filled by osteoblasts and then by lamellar bone oriented perpendicular to the axis of the bone. This initial process takes three to eight weeks. Perpendicular orientation of lamellar bone is weak, thus a secondary osteonal reconstruction is required to re-orient the lamellar bone longitudinally. This suggests that the healing process involves the formation of woven bone, which is then replaced by lamellar bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
