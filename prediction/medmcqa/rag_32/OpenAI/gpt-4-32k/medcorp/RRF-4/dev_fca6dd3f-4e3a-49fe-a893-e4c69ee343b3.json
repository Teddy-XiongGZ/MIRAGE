    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case of dental avulsion in an 8-year-old child. The avulsed tooth was contaminated with debris and the child was brought to the dental clinic within 20 minutes. According to the documents, immediate replantation of the avulsed tooth is the recommended treatment. However, the tooth should be cleaned before replantation. Scrubbing or curetting the root surface might damage the periodontal ligament cells which are crucial for the healing process. Therefore, the tooth should be gently rinsed with a solution like saline to remove the debris. Root canal treatment (RCT) is not immediately necessary and can be performed later if needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
