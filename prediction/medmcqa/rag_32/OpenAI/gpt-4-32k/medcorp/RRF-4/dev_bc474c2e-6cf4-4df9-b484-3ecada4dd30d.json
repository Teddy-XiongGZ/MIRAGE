    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle spindles are found within the belly of a skeletal muscle and are stretch receptors that primarily detect changes in the length of the muscle. They convey length information to the central nervous system via afferent nerve fibers. This information can be processed by the brain as proprioception. The responses of muscle spindles to changes in length also play an important role in regulating the contraction of muscles, for example, by activating motor neurons via the stretch reflex to resist muscle stretch. Therefore, muscle spindles are receptors for stretch receptor reflex, not for a variety of multisynaptic reflexes. They are not limited to antigravity extensor muscles, they are found in most skeletal muscles. They are not excited by both stretch and contraction of the muscles, they primarily detect changes in the length of the muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
