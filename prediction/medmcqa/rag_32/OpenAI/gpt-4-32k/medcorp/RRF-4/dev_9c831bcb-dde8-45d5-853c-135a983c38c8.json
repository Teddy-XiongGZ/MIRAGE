    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The variance of a data set is calculated by taking the mean of the squared differences from the mean. In this case, the variance of Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) would be the square of the standard deviation, which is 11^2 = 121. Similarly, the variance of Vitamin D would be 3^2 = 9. Comparing these two variances, it is clear that the variance of DBP is greater than the variance of Vitamin D. However, it is not 4 times greater.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
