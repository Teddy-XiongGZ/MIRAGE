    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The guiding plane is a concept used in dentistry, particularly in the design of removable partial dentures. It refers to the axial surfaces of abutment teeth that are parallel or nearly parallel to the path of insertion and removal of the denture. The guiding plane provides a path of insertion and removal of the restoration (option A), provides stabilizing characteristics against horizontal rotation of the denture (option B), and eliminates detrimental strain to abutment teeth during placing or removing restoration (option C). However, the guiding plane does not engage the abutment tooth in such a manner as to resist displacement of restoration away from the basal seat (option D). This function is typically performed by other components of the denture, such as clasps or other retention devices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
