    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate a case of fulminant hepatitis, which is a severe form of acute hepatitis characterized by rapid deterioration of liver function, jaundice, and altered sensorium. The viral markers show that the patient is reactive for Anti-HAV IgG and Anti-HBc IgG, indicating past infections of hepatitis A and B, respectively. However, the patient is also reactive for Anti-HEV IgM, which indicates a current or recent infection with hepatitis E. Given that the patient's symptoms are acute and severe, and the fact that hepatitis E is known to cause fulminant hepatitis, particularly in pregnant women, the most likely diagnosis is fulminant hepatitis due to hepatitis E infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
