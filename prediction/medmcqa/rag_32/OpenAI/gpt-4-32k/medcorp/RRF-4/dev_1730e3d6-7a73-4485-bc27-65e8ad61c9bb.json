    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intensifying screens are used in radiography to amplify the effect of the X-ray photons. They work by converting X-ray energy into visible light, which then exposes the radiographic film. This process allows for a lower dose of radiation to be used to achieve the same level of film exposure. Therefore, the use of intensifying screens can decrease the amount of radiation exposure to the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
