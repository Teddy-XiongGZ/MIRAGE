    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Branchial fistulae are formed due to the abnormal persistence of the embryonic branchial clefts. The branchial clefts are embryological structures, and their abnormal development can lead to the formation of branchial anomalies, including fistulas. Therefore, the persistence of a branchial cleft, not a branchial arch, would lead to a branchial fistula. Now, it's about determining whether it's the 1st or 2nd branchial cleft. While both can lead to fistulas, the 2nd branchial cleft is more commonly associated with branchial fistulas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 2nd branchial cleft.\"}"
