    "Step 1: Identify the role of each choice in the glycogenolysis pathway based on the provided documents. Step 2: Calmodulin is mentioned in Document [27] as a subunit of muscle glycogen phosphorylase kinase, which increases its activity in the presence of calcium. This suggests that calmodulin is a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase. Step 3: c-AMP is mentioned in Document [26] as a molecule that decreases in concentration when insulin is released, inhibiting Protein Kinase A (PKA) and preventing the phosphorylation cascade that ends with the formation of active glycogen phosphorylase a. This suggests that c-AMP is a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase. Step 4: Protein Kinase A (PKA) is mentioned in Document [14] as an enzyme that activates phosphorylase kinase, which subsequently phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase. This suggests that PKA is a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase. Step 5: Glycogenin is mentioned in Document [29] as a protein primer required for the initiation of glycogen synthesis. However, there is no mention of glycogenin being a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase. Based on these steps, the answer is D. Glycogenin.
