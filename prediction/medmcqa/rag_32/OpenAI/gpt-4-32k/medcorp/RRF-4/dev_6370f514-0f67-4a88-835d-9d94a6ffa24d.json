    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A pathognomonic sign is a particular sign whose presence means that a particular disease is present beyond any doubt. In the case of mandibular fractures, the documents mention several signs that could be associated with this condition. Document [10] mentions that a sublingual hematoma is suggestive of an occult mandibular fracture. Document [11] mentions that ecchymosis in the mouth floor is a pathognomonic sign of a mandibular body fracture. Document [30] mentions that malocclusion and facial asymmetry were strong predictors of fracture. However, among the options, the term 'pathognomonic' is specifically used for ecchymosis in the mouth floor, which is not an option here. Therefore, the most common sign among the options provided that is associated with mandibular fractures is malocclusion, as mentioned in multiple documents including [1], [4], [5], [19], [26], and [30].\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Malocclusion\"}"
