    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lignocaine, also known as lidocaine, is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic drug. According to Document [0], the metabolism of lignocaine is abnormal in patients with cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction. Document [1] and Document [16] state that systemic exposure to excessive quantities of lidocaine mainly result in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects. CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations. Cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. Document [25] lists cardiovascular collapse as a complication of lidocaine toxicity. Therefore, the cardiovascular collapse due to excess plasma level of lignocaine is likely due to myocardial depression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
