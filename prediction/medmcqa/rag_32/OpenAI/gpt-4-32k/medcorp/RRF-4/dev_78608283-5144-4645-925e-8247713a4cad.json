    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the development of granules in a cell before ovulation. From the documents, it is clear that granules are formed in the oocyte during its growth and maturation process. Document [0] mentions that in mammals, the oocyte continuously produces and translocates cortical granules to the cortex until ovulation occurs. Document [2] also mentions that antral follicle development plays an important role in the process of oocyte surface differentiation, but it does not affect oocyte capacity to normally distribute cortical granules. Document [3] states that cortical granule migration is considered an indication of oocyte maturity and organelle organization. Document [10] mentions that follicular development is directly under gonadotropins control, LH and FSH. These use cAMP as an intracellular second messenger, with growth factors and cytokines also influencing their development in vivo. Document [27] mentions that the LH surge induces differentiation of the granulosa cells\u2014a process that continues for several days after ovulation. During the periovulatory period, the LH surge induces the following shifts in steroidogenic activity of the mural granulosa cells (now turning into granulosa lutein cells). Therefore, it can be concluded that the development of granules in a cell before ovulation is dependent on LH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. LH\"}"
