    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The skin and mucosa of the cheek are different in several ways. According to Document [2], the oral mucosa, which includes the inside lining of the cheeks, is part of the lining mucosa and is nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. This is further confirmed by Document [6] which states that nonkeratinized squamous epithelium covers the inner cheeks. On the other hand, the skin of the cheek, as per Document [5], is similar to most skin in the human body and is the first line of defense from the outside environment. Therefore, the main difference between the skin and mucosa of the cheek is that the mucosa is nonkeratinized while the skin is keratinized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
