    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator wants to compare the means of more than two groups (non-smokers, light smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers). The Student-t test is used to compare the means of two groups, so it's not suitable here. The Chi square test is used for categorical data, not for comparing means. Between One way ANOVA and Two way ANOVA, the former is used when we want to test the effects of one single factor on a response variable, while the latter is used when we want to test the effects of two factors on a response variable. In this case, there is only one factor, which is the smoking status (non-smokers, light smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers). Therefore, One way ANOVA is the most appropriate statistical test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
