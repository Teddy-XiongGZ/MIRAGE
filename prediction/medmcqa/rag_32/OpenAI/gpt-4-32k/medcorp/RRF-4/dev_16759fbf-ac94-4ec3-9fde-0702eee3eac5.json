    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A placebo is a substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value. It is often used in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of a new treatment or drug. Herbal medication with no known effect could potentially be a placebo, but it's not the best example because it might still have some unknown effects. Physiotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are active treatments, so they can't be considered placebos. Sham surgery, on the other hand, is a procedure that mimics real surgery but doesn't have a therapeutic effect. It's often used in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of surgical procedures. Therefore, sham surgery is the best example of a placebo.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
