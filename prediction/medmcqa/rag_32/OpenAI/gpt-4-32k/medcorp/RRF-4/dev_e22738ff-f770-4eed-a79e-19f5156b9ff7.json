However, the document does not specify what these instructions are. Document [24] mentions that bisphosphonates have stringent dosing procedures, but it does not provide details. Document [9] advises individuals who take bisphosphonates to never allow the tablet to dissolve in the mouth as this causes damage to the oral mucosa.
