    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's pH is 7.40, which is within the normal range of 7.35-7.45, indicating no acidemia or alkalemia. The pCO2 is 40 mm Hg, which is also within the normal range of 35-45 mm Hg, indicating no respiratory acidosis or alkalosis. The HCO3 is 25 mEq/L, which is within the normal range of 22-28 mEq/L, indicating no metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. The patient's sodium and chloride levels are also within normal ranges.
