    "Step 1: Prinzmetal's angina is characterized by chest pain at rest due to vasospasm of the coronary arteries. This is mentioned in Document [0], Document [5], and Document [9]. Step 2: The ECG changes in Prinzmetal's angina include ST-segment elevation, which is mentioned in Document [0] and Document [9]. However, there is no mention of Q waves becoming normal after a few hours, which makes option C incorrect. Step 3: Document [6] mentions that Prinzmetal angina usually affects only one coronary vessel, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, the claim in option A that the right coronary artery generally presents as inferior wall MI in Prinzmetal's angina cannot be confirmed. Step 4: Document [5] and Document [9] mention that Prinzmetal's angina is due to spasms in the coronary arteries, but they do not specify whether these spasms occur distal to atherosclerotic areas, which makes option B uncertain. Step 5: Since options A, B, and C are either incorrect or uncertain, option D, which states that all of the above are true, is also incorrect. Based on the information from the documents, none of the options A, B, C, or D can be confirmed as correct. The documents do not provide enough specific information to confirm any of the options. Therefore, the answer is \"None of the above\". However, since this option is not provided, the question cannot be answered based on the provided documents.
