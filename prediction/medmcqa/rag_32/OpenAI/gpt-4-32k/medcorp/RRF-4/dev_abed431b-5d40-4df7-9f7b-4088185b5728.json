    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of cells in the retina that are radio-resistant. From the documents, it is clear that the retina has a relatively high resistance to radiation due to its ability to repair damage caused by environmental factors (Document 1). However, the question is asking about specific cells. Document 3 mentions that not all regions of the retina are equally susceptible to radiation-induced necrosis, indicating that some cells may be more resistant than others. Document 3 also mentions that the ganglion cell axonal outgrowth from control retinas disintegrated abruptly at 5-7 days in vitro, suggesting that ganglion cells may not be the most radio-resistant. Document 25 mentions that retinal ganglion and retinal pigment epithelial cells are preserved while choroidal endothelial cells are completely inhibited at 6-8 cobalt gray equivalent proton beam radiation. This suggests that retinal pigment epithelial cells could be the radio-resistant cells in the retina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Retinal pigment epithelium\"}"
