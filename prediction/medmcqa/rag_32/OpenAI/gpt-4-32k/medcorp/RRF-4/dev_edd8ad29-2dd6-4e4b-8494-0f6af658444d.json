    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best method of intubation for a pediatric patient who is planned for a costochondral graft for TMJ ankylosis. The documents do not provide direct information about the best method of intubation for such a procedure. However, considering the nature of the procedure, which involves surgery in the oral and maxillofacial region, it is reasonable to assume that general anesthesia would be the most appropriate choice. This is because general anesthesia provides complete control over the airway, which is crucial during such procedures. Awake fibreoptic intubation might be traumatic for a pediatric patient and topical anesthesia plus sedation might not provide sufficient control over the airway. Tracheostomy is usually reserved for more complex cases where other methods of securing the airway are not possible or safe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
