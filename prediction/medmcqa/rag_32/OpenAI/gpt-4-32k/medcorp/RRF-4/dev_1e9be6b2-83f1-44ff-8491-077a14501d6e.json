    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Kraissl's lines are mentioned in several documents. Document [1] defines Kraissl's lines as a set of anatomical skin lines that are the lines of maximum skin tension. They are defined in living individuals. Document [3] also mentions that the incision along the Kraissla's Line is more reasonable because it will run along the direction of the greatest skin tension. Document [21] also confirms the contribution of skin pre-tension on the anisotropy of the skin and the relation with the Kraissl's lines orientation. Therefore, based on these documents, Kraissl's lines are related to skin tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Relaxed tension lines in skin\"}"
