    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [9] mentions that root resorption of the molar is slight and progressive when the successor premolar begins formation until stage D, and becomes higher starting at stage E. It also mentions that it is possible to determine the state of the child's maturation and the CRR according to dental and chronological age. However, it does not provide a specific age. Document [1] mentions that root resorption of deciduous teeth is an important aspect of dental development, but it does not provide a specific age either. Document [11] mentions that unexpected early resorption of primary molars and canines in 14 patients without agenesis. The study showed an abnormal resorption pattern of roots and crown of primary teeth before the permanent successor had barely begun root formation. This indicates that resorption of primary molars and canines may occur independently from eruptional processes in the succeeding permanent tooth. However, it does not provide a specific age. None of the documents provide a specific age at which root resorption starts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
