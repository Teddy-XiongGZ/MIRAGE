    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Efferent tracts are the pathways that carry signals away from the brain. According to Document [0], the superior cerebellar peduncles represent the main output route from the cerebellum, and most of their fibers are efferent. These efferent pathways emerge from cerebellar nuclei. Document [4] also mentions that most of the output from the cerebellum initially synapses onto the deep cerebellar nuclei before exiting via the three peduncles. Document [13] and Document [24] also confirm that output from the cerebellum originates from the deep cerebellar nuclei. Therefore, the efferent tracts from the cerebellum arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
