    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what an amide group is. From Document [0], I learned that amides are a type of compound with a specific structure, and they are found in many drugs. Next, I need to look at each of the drugs in the options and determine if they contain an amide group. From Document [26], I learned that Bupivacaine belongs to the amino amide group. From Document [29], I learned that Xylocaine (another name for Lidocaine) and Lignocaine are both amines, which are a type of amide. Finally, from Document [6], I learned that Procaine is structurally similar to Procainamide, but instead of an amide group, it contains an ester group. Therefore, Procaine does not belong to the amide group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
