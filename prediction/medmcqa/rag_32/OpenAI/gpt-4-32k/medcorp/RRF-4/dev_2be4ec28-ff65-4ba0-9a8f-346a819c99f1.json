    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiamine, also known as Vitamin B1, is a crucial molecule for all life forms because it is an indispensable cofactor for oxidative energy metabolism. It is required by three different enzymes to allow for conversion of ingested nutrients into energy. These enzymes include pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH) which are part of the Kreb's Cycle. The Kreb's Cycle is a central metabolic pathway involved in the regulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. When there is a deficiency of thiamine, the functioning of these enzymes is impaired, resulting in inadequate production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or energy for the cells functioning. Therefore, thiamine deficiency decreases cellular metabolism because it is a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
