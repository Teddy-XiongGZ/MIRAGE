    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sequential arrangement of fetal scans. Looking at the options, growth scan, triple marker, anomalous scan, and NT scan are all types of fetal scans. However, the question is asking about the sequence of these scans, not just the types. The documents do not provide a specific sequence for these scans. However, it is generally known that NT scan is usually done first, followed by the anomalous scan, and then the growth scan. The triple marker is a blood test, not a scan, so it doesn't fit into the sequence of scans. Therefore, the answer should be all the scans mentioned, as they are all part of the sequential arrangement of fetal scans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
