    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the facial proportions between the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the face. From Document [0], it is mentioned that a good canon for both sexes today is stomion-gnathion being 70% of subnasale-stomion. The Vitruvian thirds in the lower face have to be adjusted to a 30% upper lip, 70% lower lip-chin proportion. Document [2] also mentions that the ratio of Upper Anterior Facial Height to Total Anterior Facial Height remained constant irrespective of the sex. This ratio can be taken into account rather than absolute linear measurements when studying deviations of the face. Document [8] mentions that the vertical dimension can be measured by facial thirds, with ideal facial aesthetics showing equality between each vertical third. The face is divided into thirds \u2013 hairline to glabella; glabella to subnasale; and subnasale to the lowest part of the chin. From these documents, it can be inferred that the facial proportions between the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the face are approximately equal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 34:33:33\"}"
