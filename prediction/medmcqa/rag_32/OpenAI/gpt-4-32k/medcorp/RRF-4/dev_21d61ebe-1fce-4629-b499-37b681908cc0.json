    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cornual blockage refers to the obstruction of the fallopian tubes at the junction where they meet the uterus. This can be a cause of infertility as it prevents the sperm from reaching the egg for fertilization. According to the documents, hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a common diagnostic tool used to detect such abnormalities. However, the documents also suggest that HSG has limitations and may not always accurately diagnose tubal pathology. Therefore, further confirmation by laparoscopy is often recommended, especially in cases of suspected tubal pathology revealed by HSG. In terms of management, the documents suggest that in-vitro fertilization (IVF) could be an option for women with bilateral cornual block, as it bypasses the need for the sperm to travel through the fallopian tubes. Tuboplasty, a surgical procedure to repair or remove blockages in the fallopian tubes, could also be an option, but it may not always be successful and could lead to complications. Hydrotubation, a procedure that involves flushing the fallopian tubes with a saline solution, is mentioned in the documents, but it is not specifically recommended for cornual block. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy are primarily diagnostic procedures, not treatments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. In-vitro feilization\"}"
