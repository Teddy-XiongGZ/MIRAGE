    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of persistent productive cough, clubbing, wheeze, and crackles suggest a lung condition. The documents mention several conditions with similar symptoms, including bronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumonia. However, to confirm the diagnosis, imaging tests are usually required. Among the options, HRCT and Chest X-ray are commonly used for lung conditions. MRI is not typically used for lung imaging due to the lungs' high air content and the heart's motion. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is more invasive and typically used when other tests are inconclusive. HRCT is more detailed and can provide more specific information about the lung's condition than a Chest X-ray, making it the most specific investigation to confirm the diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
