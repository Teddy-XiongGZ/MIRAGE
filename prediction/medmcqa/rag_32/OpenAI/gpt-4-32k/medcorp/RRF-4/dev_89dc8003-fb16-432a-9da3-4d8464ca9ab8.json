    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the haemostatic agent that is not preferred for perforation repair. From the documents, it is clear that Ferric Sulphate and Collagen are used as haemostatic agents in various surgical procedures. However, there is no mention of Freeze dried bone and Calcium Hydroxide being used as haemostatic agents. Therefore, both could be potential answers. However, Calcium Hydroxide is commonly used in dentistry for its antimicrobial properties and its ability to induce hard tissue formation, but it is not specifically used as a haemostatic agent. On the other hand, Freeze dried bone is not typically used as a haemostatic agent, but rather as a bone graft material in various surgical procedures. Therefore, Freeze dried bone is the least likely to be used as a haemostatic agent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
