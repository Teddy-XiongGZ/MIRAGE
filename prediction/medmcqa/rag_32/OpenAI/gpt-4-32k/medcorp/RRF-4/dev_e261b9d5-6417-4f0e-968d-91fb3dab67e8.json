    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the response of alveolar bone to traumatic occlusal forces. From Document [1], it is mentioned that alveolar bone undergoes constant physiologic remodeling in response to external forces, particularly occlusal forces. Bone is removed from areas where it is no longer needed and added to areas where it is needed. Osteoblasts and newly formed osteoid line the areas of tension, whereas lines of compression are lined by osteoclasts. This indicates that in response to traumatic occlusal forces, alveolar bone has osteoblasts in areas of tension and osteoclasts in areas of pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
