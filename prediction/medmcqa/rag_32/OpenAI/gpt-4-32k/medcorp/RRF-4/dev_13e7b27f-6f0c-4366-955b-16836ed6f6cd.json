Document [0] mentions that lithium-heparin plasma is used for testing common electrolytes. Document [1] also mentions that plasma electrolyte measurements can be reliably provided using an appropriate arterial blood sample. Document [12] and [16] also mention that blood is collected in lithium heparin tubes for evaluating serum electrolytes. Document [17] also mentions that sodium and potassium can be accurately and easily measured directly in heparinized blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lithium heparin\"}"
