    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include rotatory vertigo and nausea in the morning upon changing the position of the head. Document [0] describes a similar case where the patient experiences vertigo worsened by head movement and has nystagmus, which is a condition that causes involuntary eye movement. Document [5] provides more information about a condition called chronic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is characterized by brief attacks of rotatory vertigo and concomitant nystagmus elicited by rapid changes in head position relative to gravity. This seems to match the patient's symptoms closely. The other options, Labyrinthitis, Vestibular neuronitis, and Meniere's disease, are not supported by the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. BPPV\"}"
