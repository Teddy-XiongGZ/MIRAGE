    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is normally not present in urine because the kidneys are able to reabsorb all of the filtered glucose back into the bloodstream. However, when the blood glucose level increases, as happens in diabetes mellitus, the capacity of the kidneys to reabsorb glucose is exceeded. This is known as the renal reabsorption threshold. When this threshold is exceeded, glucose appears in the urine, a condition known as glucosuria. Therefore, the presence of glucose in urine indicates that the renal threshold for glucose has been exceeded.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
