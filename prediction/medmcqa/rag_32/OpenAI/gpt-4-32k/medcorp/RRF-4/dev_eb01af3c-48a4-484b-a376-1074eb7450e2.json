    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"HCN channels are known to be involved in the generation of spontaneous electrical activity in the heart and the regulation of synaptic transmission in the brain. They are also known to contribute to the control of cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity. Therefore, they play a role in cardiac rhythm generation. There is no mention in the documents of HCN channels being involved in the generation of mitochondrial action potential or myocardial muscle contraction. While HCN channels are involved in neuronal processes, including synaptic transmission, the specific role of memory formation is not explicitly mentioned.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
