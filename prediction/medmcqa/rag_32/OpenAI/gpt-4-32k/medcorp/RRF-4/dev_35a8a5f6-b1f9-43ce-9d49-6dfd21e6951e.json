    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the test that is not used to check the biocompatibility of dental materials in animals. From the documents, it is clear that implantation tests and sensitization tests are used for this purpose. The Buehler test is also used in biocompatibility testing of materials. However, the Ames test is a bacterial test used to evaluate the mutagenic potential of chemical compounds, and it is not specifically mentioned in the context of animal testing for dental material biocompatibility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
