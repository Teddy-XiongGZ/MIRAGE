    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pseudomembranous colitis is often associated with antibiotic use. According to Document [0], various antibiotics are associated with the development of pseudomembranous colitis, with the most frequently associated being the combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. However, this specific combination is not listed in the answer choices. Document [3] mentions that apart from clindamycin, the antibiotics most commonly responsible for pseudomembranous colitis are cephalosporins and ampicillin (or amoxicillin). Document [6] also mentions that ampicillin, penicillin, and clindamycin are the drugs most frequently reported to cause pseudomembranous colitis in pediatric patients. Document [15] also mentions that pseudomembranous colitis most frequently appears after the application of clindamycin, lincomycin, ampicillin, cephalosporins, and other antibiotics. Based on these documents, it seems that all the antibiotics listed in the answer choices are associated with pseudomembranous colitis. However, clindamycin is mentioned more frequently and seems to be more strongly associated with pseudomembranous colitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Clindamycin\"}"
