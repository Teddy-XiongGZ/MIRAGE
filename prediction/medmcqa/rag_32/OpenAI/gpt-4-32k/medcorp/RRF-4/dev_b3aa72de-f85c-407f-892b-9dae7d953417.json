    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about each of the drugs listed in the options. Rifampicin, Linezolid, Nitrofurantoin, and Metronidazole. After reviewing the documents, I found no information about these drugs. Therefore, I will use my medical knowledge to answer this question. Rifampicin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in bacterial cells, which affects RNA synthesis, not DNA synthesis. Linezolid is a protein synthesis inhibitor, it does not affect DNA synthesis. Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic that damages bacterial DNA, thus it affects DNA synthesis. Metronidazole is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal medication. It works by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis by disrupting the DNA of microbial cells. Therefore, the drug that does not affect DNA synthesis is Linezolid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
