    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, and can be spread from one person to another. However, not all infectious diseases are communicable, meaning they can't be spread from person to person. According to Document [17], contagious diseases are a subset of infectious diseases that are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person. Non-contagious infectious diseases, on the other hand, do not spread through everyday contact. Measles, mumps, and scarlet fever are all contagious diseases, meaning they can be spread from person to person. Tetanus, however, is caused by a bacteria that is commonly found in soil, dust, and manure. It is not spread from person to person, making it an infectious but non-communicable disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tetanus\"}"
