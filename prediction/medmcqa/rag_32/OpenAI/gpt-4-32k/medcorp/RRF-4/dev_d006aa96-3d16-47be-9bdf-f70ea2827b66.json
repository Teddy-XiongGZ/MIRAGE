    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-working side interference refers to an occlusal contact on the side the mandible is moving away from that prevents harmonious movement of the mandible. This interference can be harmful to the functional occlusion system. To remove this interference, we need to reduce the contact between the maxillary and mandibular teeth on the non-working side. This can be achieved by reducing the supporting cusps of the teeth involved. The supporting cusps are the cusps of the teeth that make contact with the opposing teeth during occlusion. Both maxillary and mandibular teeth are involved in this occlusion, so reducing the supporting cusps of either arch could potentially remove the interference. However, to ensure complete removal of the interference, it would be more effective to reduce the supporting cusps of both the arches.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
