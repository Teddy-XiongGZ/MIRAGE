    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is a condition where the inner lining of the heart, particularly the heart valves, is infected, often leading to the formation of vegetations. These vegetations can break off and embolize, or travel, to other parts of the body. The direction of embolization depends on the location of the vegetation. In a patient with mitral valve vegetations, the blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle and then to the systemic circulation, which includes the brain, liver, and spleen. However, the blood from the left side of the heart does not normally flow back to the lungs, which are part of the pulmonary circulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
