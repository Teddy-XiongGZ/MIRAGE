    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about the orientation of enamel rods. Document [8] states that enamel rods are not perpendicular to the surface except at the edge of the cusps and occasionally at the cervical area. This contradicts choice A. Next, I need to find information about whether enamel rods are parallel to each other. Document [29] states that within each rod, crystals are not co-oriented with one another or with the long axis of the rod. This contradicts choice B. Finally, I need to find information about the diameter of enamel rods. Document [1] states that an enamel rod measures 4 \u03bcm wide to 8 \u03bcm high, which contradicts both choices C and D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
