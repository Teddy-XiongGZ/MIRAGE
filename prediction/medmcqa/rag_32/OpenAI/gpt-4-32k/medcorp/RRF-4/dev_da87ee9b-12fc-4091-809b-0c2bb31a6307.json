    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the adverse effects of mechanical trituration of amalgam. Trituration is the process of grinding or mixing the components of amalgam. From the documents, it is clear that trituration affects various properties of amalgam. Document [1] mentions that trituration time influences the creep of amalgam. Document [2] talks about the dimensional changes of dental amalgams during setting due to trituration. Document [4] mentions that variation in trituration time can affect the mechanical properties of amalgam. However, none of the documents mention that trituration affects the hardness of the filling, tarnish resistance, or the final gloss of the filling. Document [4] does mention that clinicians may vary trituration time to improve handling characteristics, which could imply an effect on working time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
