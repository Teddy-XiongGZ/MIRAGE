    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet can be measured in three ways: the true conjugate, the obstetric conjugate, and the anatomical conjugate. According to Document [0], the obstetric conjugate measures 10.5 cm on average, which is the lesser anteroposterior diameter. This is also confirmed in Document [5], which states that the shortest of these three diameters is the obstetrical conjugate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Obstetric conjugate\"}"
