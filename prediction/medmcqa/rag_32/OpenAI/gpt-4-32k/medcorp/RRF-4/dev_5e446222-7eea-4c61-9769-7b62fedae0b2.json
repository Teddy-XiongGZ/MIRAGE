    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand that the question is asking about a drug taken by the mother during the late 3rd trimester that could lead to high levels of unconjugated bilirubin in a newborn. Unconjugated bilirubin is a form of bilirubin that is not yet processed by the liver, and high levels can lead to jaundice in newborns. Looking at the documents, none of them directly mention any of the drugs listed in the answer choices as causing high levels of unconjugated bilirubin in newborns. However, Document 26 mentions that sulphonamides, a class of drugs that includes cotrimoxazole, have a suggestive but not statistically significant association with neonatal jaundice. None of the other drugs listed in the answer choices are mentioned in the documents in relation to neonatal jaundice or high bilirubin levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cotrimoxazole\"}"
