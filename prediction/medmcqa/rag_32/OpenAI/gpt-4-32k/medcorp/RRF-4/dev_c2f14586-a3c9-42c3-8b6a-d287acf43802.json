    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the force required to tip a tooth. Looking at the documents, Document [12] mentions that a force of 30-50 g is required to tip a single-rooted tooth. However, the options are given in milligrams (mg). To convert grams to milligrams, we multiply by 1000. Therefore, 30-50 g is equivalent to 30000-50000 mg. None of the options match this range, so it seems there might be a mistake in the question or the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the options\"}"
