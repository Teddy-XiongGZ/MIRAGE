    "First, I need to understand what Kiesselbach's plexus is. From Document [0], I learned that Kiesselbach's plexus is a vascular network of arteries in the nose. It is formed by the anterior ethmoidal artery, the sphenopalatine artery, the greater palatine artery, a septal branch of the superior labial artery, and a posterior ethmoidal artery. Next, I need to identify which of these arteries is not a branch of the external carotid artery. From Document [1], I learned that the internal carotid artery gives rise to the ophthalmic artery, which in turn gives rise to the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries. Therefore, the anterior ethmoidal artery is not a branch of the external carotid artery. So, the answer to the question \"Which of the following is not the branch of external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus?\" is \"Anterior Ethmoidal artery\". The final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I identified the arteries that form Kiesselbach's plexus. Then, I determined which of these arteries is not a branch of the external carotid artery. I found that the anterior ethmoidal artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery, which is a branch of the internal carotid artery, not the external carotid artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
