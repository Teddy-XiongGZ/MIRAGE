    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rosettes are a histopathological feature seen in various types of tumors. Document [25] mentions that retinoblastomas can show rosette formation. Document [10] also mentions rosette formation in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the options provided in the question do not include non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection and not a tumor, so it would not show rosette formation. PNET (Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors) and Medulloblastoma are types of neuroepithelial tumors, but the documents do not specifically mention rosette formation in these tumors. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the most accurate answer would be Retinoblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
