    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information in the documents that compares the complications of ventouse and forceps assisted deliveries. Document [9] mentions that facial injury is more likely with forceps, which could suggest that transient lateral rectus palsy is more common with forceps. Document [14] also mentions that neonatal trauma is less likely with forceps, which could include subgaleal hemorrhage, cephalhematoma, and intracranial hemorrhage. Document [18] mentions that forceps delivery is associated with less risk of neonatal trauma compared to ventouse. Document [28] also mentions that Kjelland's forceps have a lower rate of adverse neonatal outcomes than all other forms of instrumental delivery. Based on these documents, it seems that all the listed complications are less likely with forceps than with ventouse, except for transient lateral rectus palsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
