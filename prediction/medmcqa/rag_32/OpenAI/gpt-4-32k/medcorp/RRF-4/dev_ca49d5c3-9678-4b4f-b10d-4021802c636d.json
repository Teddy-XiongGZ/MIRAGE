    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Penicillin allergy is a type of hypersensitivity reaction mediated by the immune system. In this context, penicillin acts as a hapten. A hapten is a small molecule that can elicit an immune response only when attached to a large carrier such as a protein; the carrier may be one that also does not elicit an immune response by itself. In the case of penicillin allergy, the penicillin molecule binds to a protein within the body, forming a complex that can be recognized by the immune system, leading to an allergic reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
