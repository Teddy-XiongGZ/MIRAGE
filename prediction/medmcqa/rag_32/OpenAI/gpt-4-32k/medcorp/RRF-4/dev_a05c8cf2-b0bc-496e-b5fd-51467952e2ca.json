    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], if a mother has already developed chickenpox and there are serious complications, she should be treated with intravenous aciclovir. However, the question does not specify if the mother has serious complications. Document [11] states that if the mother develops rash between days 4 and 5 antepartum to day 2 postpartum, generalized neonatal varicella leading to death occurs in up to 20% of affected cases. This suggests that the baby is at risk. Document [25] suggests that neonatal health care providers should be informed of peripartum varicella exposure in order to optimize early neonatal care with varicella zoster immunoglobulin and immunization. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin should be administered to neonates whenever the onset of maternal disease is between 5 days before and 2 days after delivery. This suggests that the baby should receive treatment after birth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Give antiviral treatment to baby\"}"
