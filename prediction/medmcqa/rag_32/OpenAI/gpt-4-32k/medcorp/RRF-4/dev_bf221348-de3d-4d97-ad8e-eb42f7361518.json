    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which tool, when made of the same steel and size, would be more prone to fracture. The documents provided do not contain specific information about the fracture tendencies of the specific shapes mentioned in the question (triangular reamer, rhomboid cross section file, square cross section file, Headstrom file). However, we can infer from general knowledge about material science that the tool with the least amount of material (i.e., the thinnest or smallest cross-sectional area) would be more prone to fracture, as it would have less material to resist the forces applied to it. Among the options, a triangular reamer would likely have the smallest cross-sectional area, and thus be more prone to fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
