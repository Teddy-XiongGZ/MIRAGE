    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that the amount of monomer in an acrylic resin mixture can affect its properties. For example, Document 6 mentions that as the concentration of a certain monomer increased, the strength of the composite resin decreased. Document 24 mentions that residual, unevaporated ethanol (a monomer) can lower the rate of polymerization. Document 30 mentions that the quantity of remaining unreacted double bonds (which would be higher if there is an excessive amount of monomer) may affect the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of restorative resins. Based on these documents, it seems that an excessive amount of monomer could lead to lower strength and potentially increased brittleness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Excessive brittleness\"}"
