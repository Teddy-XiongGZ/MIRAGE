    "Step 1: Review the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking for the correct statement regarding the use of ventouse in childbirth. Step 2: Review the answer choices. A. Minor scalp abrasions and subgaleal hematomas in new born are more frequent than forceps B. Can be applied when foetal head is above the level of ischial spine C. Maternal trauma is more frequent than forceps D. Can not be used when fetal head is not fully rotated Step 3: Review the relevant documents. Document [0] and [1] provide information about the use of ventouse and forceps in childbirth. Document [3] provides information about the proper use of ventouse. Step 4: Compare the information in the documents with the answer choices. A. Document [0] mentions that babies who had attempted ventouse deliveries have lower apgar score at one minute than attempted forceps, but it does not mention anything about minor scalp abrasions and subgaleal hematomas. B. Document [3] mentions that for proper use of the ventouse, the head should be engaged in the birth canal, but it does not specify whether it can be applied when the foetal head is above the level of the ischial spine. C. Document [0] mentions that extension of an episiotomy was more likely to occur with ventouse than forceps deliveries while 3rd degree perineal tear occurred more with forceps deliveries. This suggests that maternal trauma is not more frequent with ventouse than forceps. D. Document [3] mentions that the head position should be known for the proper use of ventouse, but it does not specify whether it can be used when the fetal head is not fully rotated. Step 5: Choose the correct answer. Based on the information in the documents, none of the answer choices can be definitively confirmed as true. The output in json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the correct statement regarding the use of ventouse in childbirth. After reviewing the relevant documents and comparing the information with the answer choices, none of the answer choices can be definitively confirmed as true based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
