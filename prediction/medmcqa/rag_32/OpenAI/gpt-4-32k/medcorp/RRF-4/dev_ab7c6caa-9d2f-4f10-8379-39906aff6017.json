    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents suggest that transvaginal sonography is typically performed in post-menopausal bleeding when the endometrial thickness is greater than a certain threshold. This threshold varies across studies, but the most commonly mentioned threshold in the documents is 4mm or 5mm. For example, Document [0] suggests a threshold of 6mm, but this seems to be an outlier. Document [12] suggests a threshold of 5mm, Document [14] suggests a threshold of 11mm, but this is for women without vaginal bleeding. Document [17] suggests a threshold of 5mm, Document [19] suggests a threshold of 4mm, Document [21] suggests a threshold of 5mm, Document [24] suggests a threshold of 4mm, Document [26] suggests a threshold of 5mm, Document [27] suggests a threshold of 5mm, Document [29] suggests a threshold of 4mm, Document [30] suggests a threshold of 5mm, and Document [31] suggests a threshold of 4mm. Therefore, the most common thresholds mentioned in the documents are 4mm and 5mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 4mm\"}"
