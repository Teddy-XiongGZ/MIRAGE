    "The Nernst equation is used to calculate the equilibrium potential for an ion based on the concentrations of that ion inside and outside the cell. The Nernst equation is: Em = RT/zF * log([ion outside the cell]/[ion inside of the cell]). In this case, the ion is negatively charged, so the sign of the potential will be reversed. The concentration of the ion outside the cell is 100 mM and inside the cell is 10 mM. Therefore, the Nernst potential will be negative because the concentration of the ion is higher outside the cell than inside. The magnitude of the potential will be determined by the 10-fold concentration gradient, which corresponds to a potential of about 61 mV at body temperature. Therefore, the Nernst potential for this ion will be -61 mV. So, the answer is C. --61 mV.
