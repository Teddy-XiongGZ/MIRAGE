    "The neonatal mortality rate is calculated as the number of neonatal deaths per 1000 live births. Step 1: Identify the number of neonatal deaths. From the question, we know that there were 450 neonatal deaths. Step 2: Identify the number of live births. From the question, we know that there were 12,450 live births. Step 3: Calculate the neonatal mortality rate using the formula: (Number of neonatal deaths / Number of live births) * 1000. Substituting the values from steps 1 and 2 into the formula gives us: (450 / 12,450) * 1000 = 36.14. Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us 36. So, the neonatal mortality rate for the population in 2012 was 36 per 1000 live births. Therefore, the answer is A. 36.
