    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxilla is a bone of the face, located in the upper jaw area. Growth of the maxilla in the vertical direction would involve an increase in its height. According to Document [0], vertical growth of the maxilla increases rapidly during the period of eruption of deciduous and permanent teeth, which suggests that the growth of the alveolus, where the teeth are housed, plays a role. Document [29] also mentions that growth of the maxilla happens at the expansion of the circumaxillary sutures, which suggests that growth at sutures also contributes to the vertical growth of the maxilla. The cranial base and synchondrosis are not directly related to the vertical growth of the maxilla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Growth of the alveolus, B. Growth at sutures\"}"
