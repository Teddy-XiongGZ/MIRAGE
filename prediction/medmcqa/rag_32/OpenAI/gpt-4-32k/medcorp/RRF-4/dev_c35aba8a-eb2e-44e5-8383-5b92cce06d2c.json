    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents provided do not directly compare the efficacy of the four drugs listed in the question. However, Document [0] mentions that phenytoin and carbamazepine are among the most commonly used older medications for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Document [3] and Document [25] also list phenytoin and carbamazepine as treatment options for partial epilepsy, which includes TLE.
