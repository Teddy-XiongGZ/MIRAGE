    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about which anesthetic agent can cause pain on IV administration. Looking at the documents, Document [27] mentions that rocuronium, an anesthetic agent, can cause intense discomfort or pain at the site of injection when administered intravenously. However, rocuronium is not one of the options provided. Therefore, I need to look for information about the anesthetic agents listed in the options. Document [0] mentions that using 1% lidocaine resulted in the least painful IV insertion, but lidocaine is not one of the options. Document [21] mentions that vecuronium dissolved in normal saline induced severe pain more frequently during injection than that dissolved in solvent, but vecuronium is also not one of the options. None of the documents provided information about pain on IV administration for ketamine, propofol, thiopentone, or midazolam. Therefore, based on the documents provided, I cannot definitively answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
