    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"NK cells are part of the innate immune system and play a crucial role in the defense against viral infections. They recognize and kill virus-infected cells. According to the documents, NK cells preferentially attack infected host cells and cancer cells because these cells have on their surface both activating proteins and, in some cases, abnormally low levels of class I MHC proteins. The high levels of class I MHC proteins found on normal host cells activate inhibitory receptors on the NK cell that suppress the killing activity of the NK cell. In contrast, the activating proteins on infected cells and cancer cells bind to activating receptors on the NK cell and stimulate the killing activity of the cell. Therefore, NK cells are effective against viral infected cells that are unable to express MHC class I proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
