    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Slow maxillary expansion is a process used to widen the upper jaw or maxilla over a period of time. According to the documents, the Quad-helix appliance is commonly used for slow maxillary expansion (Document 1). The Hyrax appliance is also mentioned in the context of slow maxillary expansion (Document 25). However, the Jack screw and Coffin spring are not specifically mentioned in the context of slow maxillary expansion in the provided documents. Therefore, I need to choose between these two options. The Jack screw is a component of many types of expanders and is used in both rapid and slow maxillary expansion. On the other hand, the Coffin spring is not typically used for slow maxillary expansion, but rather for molar distalization or rotation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Coffin spring\"}"
