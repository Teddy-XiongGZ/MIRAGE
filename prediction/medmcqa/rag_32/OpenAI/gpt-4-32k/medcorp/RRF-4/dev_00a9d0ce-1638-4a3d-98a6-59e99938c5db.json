    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pilocarpine acts on the sphincter pupillae muscle, causing it to contract and resulting in pupil constriction or miosis. This is a parasympathetic action. Therefore, we are looking for a drug that acts on the dilator pupillae muscle in a similar way, but causing dilation or mydriasis, which is a sympathetic action. Timolol is a beta-blocker and does not directly act on the dilator pupillae. Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and would enhance parasympathetic activity, not sympathetic. Tropicamide is a muscarinic antagonist and causes dilation of the pupil, but it acts by blocking the action of acetylcholine on the sphincter pupillae, not by acting on the dilator pupillae. Epinephrine, however, is an adrenergic agonist and would stimulate the dilator pupillae muscle, causing pupil dilation or mydriasis. This is analogous to the action of pilocarpine on the sphincter pupillae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Epinephrine\"}"
