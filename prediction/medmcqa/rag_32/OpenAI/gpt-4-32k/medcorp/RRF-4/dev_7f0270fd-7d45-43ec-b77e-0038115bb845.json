    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The risk of transmission of Hepatitis B from a mother to her child depends on the mother's HBeAg status. According to Document 27, the risk of transmission is highest when the mother is HBeAg positive. However, in this case, the mother is anti-HBeAg positive, which indicates that she has antibodies against the HBeAg, suggesting a lower level of infectiousness. Document 16 also supports this, stating that the presence of maternal anti-HBe is protective against HBV mother-to-child transmission, independent of the maternal serum HBV viral load. Therefore, the risk of transmission in this case would be lower.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 20%\"}"
