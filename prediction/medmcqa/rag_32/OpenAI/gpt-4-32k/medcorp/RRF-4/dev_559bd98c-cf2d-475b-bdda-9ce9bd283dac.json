    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Decalcification and discoloration of teeth during orthodontic treatment can be caused by several factors. Document [3] mentions that poor oral hygiene can lead to tooth discolorations and enamel decalcification. Document [12] mentions that acid etching increases enamel decalcification.
