    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most useful test for diagnosis and management of a leaky meningomyelocele in a 7-day old infant. Meningomyelocele is a type of spina bifida where a sac of fluid protrudes through an opening in the baby's back, containing part of the spinal cord and nerves. When it's leaky, it means there's a risk of infection.

Therefore, a wound swab for culture and sensitivity would be the most useful test in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
