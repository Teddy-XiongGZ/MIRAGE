    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mean axis of the ECG represents the general direction of the ventricular depolarization wavefront. An axis of 90 degrees indicates that the wavefront is moving downwards. In the limb leads, lead II and lead aVF are oriented downwards. However, the question asks for the maximum voltage of the R wave, which is typically seen in the lead that is most parallel to the direction of the depolarization wavefront. Therefore, the lead that would show the maximum voltage of the R wave would be lead aVF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
