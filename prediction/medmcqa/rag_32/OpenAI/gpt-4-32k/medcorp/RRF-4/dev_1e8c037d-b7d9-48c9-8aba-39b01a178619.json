    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Optic atrophy is a condition that involves the degeneration of the optic nerve, which can be caused by a variety of factors. Retinitis pigmentosa, methanol poisoning, and central retinal arterial occlusion (CRAO) are all conditions that can lead to optic atrophy, as they can cause damage to the optic nerve. However, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy is a condition that affects the choroid, a layer of blood vessels in the eye, and does not directly involve the optic nerve. Therefore, optic atrophy is not typically seen in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
