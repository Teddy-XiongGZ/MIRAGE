    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The male partner has a low semen volume per ejaculate and no sperms on examination under the microscope. This could indicate a blockage in the ejaculatory duct or absence of the vas deferens. Document [0] and Document [1] suggest that a postejaculatory urinalysis should be performed if ejaculate volume is less than 1 mL. Document [7] also suggests checking post-ejaculation urine, TRUS, and hormonal analysis for low ejaculate volume. Document [12] suggests that low semen volume with azoospermia might be due to ejaculatory duct obstruction or from the congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Therefore, the next line of management should be to check for ejaculatory duct obstruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Per-rectal examination to check ejaculatory duct obstruction\"}"
