    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are classified based on the type of chemical reaction they catalyze. This is evident from Document [2] and Document [3] which mention the classification of enzymes into oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, and translocases based on the type of reaction they catalyze. This can be interpreted as the 'action on substrate'. However, there is no mention in the documents about the classification of enzymes based on the 'action of coenzymes' or the 'nature of the enzymes'. Therefore, the answer should be 'Action on substrate'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
