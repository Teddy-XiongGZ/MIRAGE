    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is transported in the intestine via a mechanism called sodium-glucose cotransport, as mentioned in Document [0] and Document [9]. This mechanism is a type of secondary active transport, where the transport of glucose is coupled with the transport of sodium ions down their electrochemical gradient. This process does not directly use ATP, but it relies on the sodium gradient that is maintained by the primary active transport of sodium ions out of the cell. Therefore, the correct answer is secondary active transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
