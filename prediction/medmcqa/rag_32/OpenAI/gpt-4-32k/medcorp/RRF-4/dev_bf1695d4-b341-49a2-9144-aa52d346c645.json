    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"HIV is a virus that primarily targets the immune system. According to Document [1], HIV binds to immune cell surface receptors, including CD4 and CXCR4 or CD4 and CCR5. This binding results in the fusion of the HIV membrane with the cell membrane, leading to active or latent infection. In active infection, the HIV pro-virus is active and HIV virus particles are actively replicated. Document [4] also mentions that once the virus has entered the bloodstream, it attaches to and enters T-helper cells (CD4 cells) in order to replicate. Therefore, the virus is produced and propagated in T-helper cells, also known as T4 lymphocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
