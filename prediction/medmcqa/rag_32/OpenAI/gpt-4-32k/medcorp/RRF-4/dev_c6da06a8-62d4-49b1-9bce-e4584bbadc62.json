    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vesicoureteric reflux is a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys. According to Document [0], vesicoureteric reflux is most commonly recognized in girls after urinary tract infection. However, it is also increasingly recognized in neonates, particularly boys, after an abnormal prenatal sonogram. Document [4] also suggests that it can be estimated that 2.2% of girls and 0.6% of boys may be found to have reflux as a result of the investigation of urinary tract infection. Document [20] also suggests that younger children are more prone to VUR because of the relative shortness of the submucosal ureters. This susceptibility decreases with age as the length of the ureters increases as the children grow. In children under the age of 1 year with a urinary tract infection, 70% will have VUR. This number decreases to 15% by the age of 12. Although VUR is more common in males antenatally, in later life there is a definite female preponderance with 85% of cases being female. Therefore, based on these documents, it can be concluded that vesicoureteric reflux is more common in older girls.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
