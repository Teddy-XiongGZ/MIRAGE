    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Niacin and riboflavin are both B vitamins that play crucial roles in the body's metabolism. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is essential for the formation of two major coenzymes, FMN and FAD, which are involved in energy metabolism, cell respiration, and other processes. Niacin, or vitamin B3, is a component of the coenzymes NAD and NADP, which are involved in multiple metabolic processes. Both of these vitamins are involved in redox reactions, which are chemical reactions involving the transfer of electrons. This is not the case for transamination reactions, methyl group transfers, or amine group transfers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
