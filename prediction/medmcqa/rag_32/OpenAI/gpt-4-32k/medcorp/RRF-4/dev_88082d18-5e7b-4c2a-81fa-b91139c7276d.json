    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The film thickness of luting cement is mentioned in several documents. Document [1] states that all materials produced film thicknesses under 30 microm at 3 minutes and under 26 microm at 2 minutes. Document [4] suggests that the cement with film thickness more than 30 \u03bcm should never be used for luting purposes. Document [6] mentions that nine materials satisfied the ADA type I specification for film thicknesses less than 25 microns. Document [15] states that all products revealed a film thickness of less than 25\u03bcm except for GC Fuji Plus. Document [25] states that the film thickness recorded in subgroup III (25.215 \u00b1 0.661 \u03bcm) was the highest. All these documents suggest that the film thickness of luting cement is less than 30 \u03bcm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
