    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-translational modification is a process that alters the properties of a protein by adding, changing, or removing certain chemical groups from the amino acids that make up the protein. From the documents, it is clear that hydroxy-proline and hydroxy-lysine are formed through post-translational modification (Document 0 and Document 5). Selenocysteine is a proteinogenic amino acid that can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms (Document 8). Triiodothyronine is not an amino acid but a thyroid hormone that affects almost every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate. Therefore, it does not undergo post-translational modification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Triiodothyronine\"}"
