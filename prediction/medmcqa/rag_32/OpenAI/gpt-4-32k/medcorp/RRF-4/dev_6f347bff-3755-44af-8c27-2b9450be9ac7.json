    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking which cell junction is not present in the structure marked with an arrow in a given diagram. Step 2: Review the documents for information about the different types of cell junctions mentioned in the options. Document [2] mentions that there are three types of junctional complexes: occluding junctions (also called tight junctions), adherens junctions, and desmosomes. Document [3] and [5] provide more information about tight junctions, also known as zona occludens. Document [1] and [20] describe gap junctions, which allow the passage of small molecules between cells. Document [4] and [6] discuss adherens junctions and desmosomes, which are anchorage sites for actin filaments and intermediate filaments, respectively. Step 3: Based on the information gathered, the junction not mentioned in the documents is the macula adherens. Therefore, the answer is C. Macula adherens. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking which cell junction is not present in the structure marked with an arrow in a given diagram.
