    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the next step after identifying a concentric teeth bite mark on a forearm. From the documents, it is clear that the first step in bite mark analysis is often to document the injury. This can be done through photography, keeping a scale for measuring below the mark and taking a photo in the plane of the bite (Document 0). However, it is also important to collect any potential DNA evidence from the bite mark, which can be done using a 2 swab technique for saliva collection (Document 30). A complete description of the injury as seen (Document C) is also crucial for further analysis. Preparing a cast using vinyl polysiloxane (Document D) is usually done later in the process, after initial documentation and collection of evidence. Therefore, the next step would likely be to document the injury through photography and potentially collect saliva samples.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Keep scale for measuring below the mark and take photo in the plane of bite\"}"
