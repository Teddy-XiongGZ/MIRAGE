    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the method used for bone sounding in modern times. Bone sounding is a method of diagnosing fractures or other bone conditions by listening to the sound produced when the bone is struck or vibrated. None of the documents provided mention the term 'bone sounding' specifically. However, Document [4] mentions the use of ultrasound in bone surgery, which could be considered a form of bone sounding as it involves the use of sound waves to visualize the internal structure of the bone. None of the answer choices provided (RVG, Probing, CBCT, Radiovisiography) are mentioned in the context of bone sounding in the documents. However, CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) and Radiovisiography are imaging techniques that could potentially be used to visualize the internal structure of the bone, similar to how ultrasound is used in the context mentioned in Document [4]. Therefore, these could be considered modern methods of 'bone sounding'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. CBCT\"}"
