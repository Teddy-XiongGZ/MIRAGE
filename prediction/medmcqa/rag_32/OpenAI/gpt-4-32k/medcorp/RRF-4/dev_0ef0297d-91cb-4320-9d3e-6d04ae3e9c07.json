    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protein synthesis in eukaryotes involves several steps and components. RNA polymerase is required for transcription, which is the first step in protein synthesis where the DNA sequence is copied into mRNA. Ribosomes are the sites where protein synthesis occurs, reading the mRNA sequence to assemble the protein. Peptidyl transferase is an enzyme that forms peptide bonds between amino acids during the process of translation, which is the synthesis of a protein from an mRNA template. Amino acyl tRNA synthetase is an enzyme that attaches the correct amino acid onto its tRNA, which is a crucial step in translation. Therefore, all of these components are required for protein synthesis in eukaryotes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
