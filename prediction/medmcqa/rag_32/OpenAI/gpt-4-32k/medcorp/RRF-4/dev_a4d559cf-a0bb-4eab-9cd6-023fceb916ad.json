    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each choice represents. PDGF stands for Platelet-Derived Growth Factor, and the letters following represent different isoforms of this growth factor. According to Document [0], PRP contains platelet-derived growth factor, but it does not specify which isoforms. Document [1] mentions PDGF, but again, does not specify the isoforms. Document [3] mentions PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, and PDGF-BB, but does not mention PDGF-cc or PDGF-Fab. Therefore, I can conclude that PDGF-cc and PDGF-Fab are not mentioned in the documents as being present in PRP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. PDGF cc and D. PDGF Fab\"}"
