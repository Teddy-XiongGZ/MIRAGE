    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks why schizonts and late trophozoite stages of Plasmodium falciparum are not seen in peripheral blood smear. Document [0] and Document [1] both mention that mature trophozoites or schizonts in peripheral blood smears are usually sequestered in the tissues. Document [11] also mentions that sequestration, the adherence of infected erythrocytes containing late developmental stages of the parasite to the endothelium of capillaries and venules, is characteristic of Plasmodium falciparum infections. Therefore, the answer is that due to adherence to the capillary endothelium, they are not seen in peripheral blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
