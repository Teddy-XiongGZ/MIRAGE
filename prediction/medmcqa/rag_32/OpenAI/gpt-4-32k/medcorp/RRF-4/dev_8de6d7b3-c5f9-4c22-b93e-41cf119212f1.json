    "The faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of a hygienic pontic in a fixed partial denture would be primarily determined by the position of the opposing contact areas. This is because the occlusal portion of the pontic must be designed to properly align with the opposing teeth during mastication. The length of the pontic, the masticatory force of the patient, and the width and crestal position of the edentulous ridge are all important factors in the overall design of the pontic, but they would not primarily determine the faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of a hygienic pontic in a fixed partial denture would be primarily determined by the position of the opposing contact areas.
