    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibrinolytic therapy involves the use of drugs that break down blood clots. An antidote for this therapy would be a drug that counteracts the effects of these drugs. Protamine is used to counteract the effects of heparin, not fibrinolytic drugs. Heparin is an anticoagulant, not an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy. Streptokinase is a fibrinolytic drug itself, not an antidote. Epsilon aminocaproic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent, which means it works against fibrinolysis, the process that fibrinolytic drugs promote. Therefore, it can be considered an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
