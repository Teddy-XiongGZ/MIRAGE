    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Massive blood transfusion can lead to several complications. According to Document 13, metabolic alkalosis can occur with massive blood transfusions because of the breakdown of citrate stored in blood into bicarbonate. This is also supported by Document 15, which mentions that metabolic complications such as acidosis and hyperkalemia can occur immediately after massive transfusion, and following transfusion, citrate toxicity can also occur, which causes alkalosis.
