    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the joint that best simulates the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) in terms of histology and morphology. Document [5] mentions that the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) is very similar to the TMJ throughout the growth period and may be more suitable for mandibular condylar replacement than the costochondral joint (CCJ). Therefore, the sternoclavicular graft would be the best choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Sternoclavicular graft\"}"
