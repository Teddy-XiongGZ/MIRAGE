    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each of the potential choices means. Load bearing refers to a fixation method that bears the entire load, without any contribution from the bone. Load sharing refers to a fixation method where both the implant and the bone share the load. Adaptation osteosynthesis refers to a fixation method that allows for some movement at the fracture site, promoting callus formation. Compression osteosynthesis refers to a fixation method that compresses the fracture ends together, promoting direct bone healing. Now, I need to look at the documents to see which of these methods is used in symphyseal fracture with lag screw fixation. Document [0] mentions that lag screw fixation was associated with fewer postoperative complications, but it does not specify the type of osteosynthesis. Document [1] mentions that cortical screw fixation is an effective procedure for the treatment of symphyseal region fractures, but again, it does not specify the type of osteosynthesis. Document [3] mentions that lag screw technique provides good interfragmentary compression, which suggests that it might be a form of compression osteosynthesis. Document [10] also mentions that lag screw fixation provides good interfragmentary compression. Based on these documents, it seems that lag screw fixation in symphyseal fractures is a form of compression osteosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
