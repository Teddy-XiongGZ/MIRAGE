    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the lipoprotein that is likely to be elevated in the blood of a person who is growing obese despite being on a fat-free, carbohydrate-rich diet. From the documents, it is clear that a high carbohydrate diet can lead to an increase in VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein) levels. This is because carbohydrates, especially simple carbohydrates, can be converted into triglycerides, which are then packaged into VLDL particles for transport in the bloodstream. VLDL is known to contribute to the development of obesity and other metabolic disorders. Therefore, in a person consuming a high carbohydrate diet, the level of VLDL is likely to be elevated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
