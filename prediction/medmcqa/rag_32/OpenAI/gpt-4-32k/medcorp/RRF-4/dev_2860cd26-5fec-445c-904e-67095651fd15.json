    "First, I will look for information about standardization in the provided documents. Document [0] and [1] provide a general understanding of standardization, but they do not mention anything about comparison between two different populations, national population as the standard population, or direct and indirect standardization. Document [2] talks about normative elements in standardization, but it does not provide information relevant to the question. Document [14] provides techniques for standardization, but it does not mention anything about the options given in the question. None of the other documents provide information relevant to the question. Based on the general understanding of standardization, it is clear that standardization allows comparison to be made between two different populations (Option A). However, it is not necessary that the national population is always taken as the standard population (Option B). The standard population can be any population that is used as a reference to compare with other populations. Therefore, Option B is not always true about standardization. For Options C and D, they are referring to the methods of direct and indirect standardization in epidemiology. Direct standardization is a method where age-specific rates of the study population are applied to the standard population. On the other hand, indirect standardization is a method where age-specific rates of the standard population are applied to the study population. Therefore, Options C and D are true about standardization. Based on the above analysis, the answer to the question is Option B. Here is the output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Standardization allows comparison between different populations, so Option A is true. The standard population in standardization is not always the national population, so Option B is not always true. Direct and indirect standardization are methods in epidemiology where age-specific rates of the study population and standard population are applied to each other, so Options C and D are true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
