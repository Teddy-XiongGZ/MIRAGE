    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ammonia is a byproduct of the body's metabolism of nitrogen. Excess ammonia in the body can be harmful, especially to the brain. The documents mention that the brain, which lacks an effective urea cycle, relies on the conversion of glutamate to glutamine for the removal of excess ammonia. This process is facilitated by the enzyme glutamine synthetase, which is predominantly found in astrocytes, a type of brain cell. Therefore, the brain removes ammonia as glutamine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Glutamine\"}"
