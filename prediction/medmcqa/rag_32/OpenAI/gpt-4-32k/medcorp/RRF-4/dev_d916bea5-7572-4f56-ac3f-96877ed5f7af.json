    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the name of an extra palatal root when it is present on the mesial side. According to Document [2], when two palatal roots exist, one of them is the normal palatal root, the other is a supernumerary structure which can be located either mesiolingually (radix mesiolingualis) or distolingually (radix distolingualis). Therefore, when the extra palatal root is present on the mesial side, it is known as radix mesiolingualis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Radix mesiolingualis\"}"
