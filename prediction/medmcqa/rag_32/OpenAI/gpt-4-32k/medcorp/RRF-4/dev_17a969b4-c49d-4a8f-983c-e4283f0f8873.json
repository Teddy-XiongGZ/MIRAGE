    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acid etching of dentin is a common procedure in dentistry, particularly in preparation for bonding. According to the documents, acid etching of dentin does remove the smear layer (Document 0), expose collagen (Document 4), and open dentinal tubules (Document 0). However, the application of acid to dentin does not increase surface tension. In fact, it decreases the surface tension of dentin (Document 9). Therefore, the statement that acid etching of dentin increases surface tension is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
