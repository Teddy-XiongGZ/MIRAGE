    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is primarily associated with the olfactory nerve, which is the first cranial nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) and the vagus nerve (X) are both involved in taste sensation, but they also carry some olfactory information. The trigeminal nerve (V) provides sensory innervation to the face and is also involved in olfaction to some extent. The hypoglossal nerve (XII), however, is primarily responsible for controlling the muscles of the tongue and does not have a role in olfaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hypoglossal\"}"
