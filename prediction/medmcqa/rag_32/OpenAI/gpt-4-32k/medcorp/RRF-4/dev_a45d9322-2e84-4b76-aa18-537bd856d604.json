    "Step 1: Identify the relevant information about Ifosfamide from the documents. - From Document [1], we know that Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent, which is a type of nitrogen mustard. This confirms choice A. - From Document [2], we learn that Ifosfamide can cause central nervous system toxicity, including encephalopathy and movement disorders. This suggests that Ifosfamide may have neurotoxic effects, which contradicts choice D. - From Document [13], we learn that stereochemistry plays a minor role in the efficacy and toxicity of cyclophosphamide but is a major factor in neurotoxicity associated with ifosfamide administration. This further contradicts choice D. - From Document [23], we learn that the degradation reactions of ifosfamide are largely independent of pH, although proton or hydroxyl catalysis occurs at extreme pH values. This does not provide information about choice B or C. Step 2: Identify the false statement. - From the information gathered, we can confirm that choice A is true and choice D is false. We do not have enough information to confirm or deny choices B and C. Based on the information available, the false statement is choice D: Ifosfamide is less neurotoxic than cyclophosphamide. Output: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I identified the relevant information about Ifosfamide from the documents. I confirmed that Ifosfamide is a nitrogen mustard, which makes choice A true. I also found information suggesting that Ifosfamide can cause central nervous system toxicity, which contradicts choice D. I did not find enough information to confirm or deny choices B and C. Based on the information available, the false statement is choice D: Ifosfamide is less neurotoxic than cyclophosphamide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
