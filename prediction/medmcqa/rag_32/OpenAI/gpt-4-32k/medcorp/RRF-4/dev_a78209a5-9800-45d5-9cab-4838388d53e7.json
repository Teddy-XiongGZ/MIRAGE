    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Document [2] mentions that Co-Cr alloys show high resistance to corrosion due to the spontaneous formation of a protective passive film composed of mostly Cr2O3, and minor amounts of cobalt and other metal oxides on the surface. This suggests that the presence of chromium in the alloy contributes to its corrosion resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Chrome\"}"
