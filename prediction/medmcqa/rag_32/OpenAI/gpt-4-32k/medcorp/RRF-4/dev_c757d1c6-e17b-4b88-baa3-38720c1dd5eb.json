    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Paradoxical suicide is not a commonly used term, but the term 'paradoxical' generally refers to something that is contrary to expectations. In the context of suicide, it could refer to a situation where suicide or suicidal tendencies increase when a patient starts to recover or improve, which is contrary to what one would expect. This is supported by Document [0] which mentions that in rare cases, antidepressants can make users obsessively violent or have suicidal compulsions, which is in marked contrast to their intended effect. This can be regarded as a paradoxical reaction. Document [1] also supports this by mentioning that rebound and withdrawal effects, including suicidality occur with antidepressant drugs. They are relatively rare but more intense than the primary action of the drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
