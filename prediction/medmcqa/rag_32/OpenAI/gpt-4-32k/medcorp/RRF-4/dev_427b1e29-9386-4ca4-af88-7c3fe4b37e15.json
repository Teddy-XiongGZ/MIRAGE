    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best method to confirm a diagnosis of internal derangement of TMJ fracture after a panoramic view has been taken. From the documents, it is clear that MRI (Document 0, 3, 14, 26), CT scan (Document 2, 3, 4, 16), and Arthroscopy (Document 17, 21, 31) are all used in the diagnosis of TMJ disorders. However, Document 3 suggests that while panoramic films can initially diagnose condylar fractures, they have a high misdiagnosis rate for intracapsular fractures, minor fractures and fractures without fragment displacement. It suggests that CT, especially coronal CT, should be considered for positioning fracture lines and confirming the displacement angle of fragment. MRI should also be used to determine the position of TMJ disc in intracapsular condylar fractures. Therefore, both MRI and CT scan can be used to confirm the diagnosis. However, the question asks for the best method to confirm the diagnosis. Given that MRI provides more detailed information about soft tissues such as the TMJ disc, it might be more suitable for confirming the diagnosis of an internal derangement of TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
