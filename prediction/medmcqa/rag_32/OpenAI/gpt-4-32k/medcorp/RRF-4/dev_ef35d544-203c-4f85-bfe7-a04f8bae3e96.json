    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporal bone is a complex structure, and its detailed evaluation requires imaging modalities that can provide high-resolution images. X-ray and USG are not capable of providing such detailed images. Between CT and MRI, CT is often preferred for its excellent imaging of bony structures. According to Document [19], diseases of the temporal bone should be diagnosed by high-resolution computed tomography (CT). Document [26] also states that high-resolution CT is the technique of choice for patients suspected of having acoustic neuromas or malignant tumors of the temporal bone. Therefore, CT is the investigation of choice for a lesion of the temporal bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
