    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Seminoma is a type of testicular cancer. According to the documents, several tumor markers are associated with seminoma. Document [10] mentions that Serum beta-HCG and LDH levels can be elevated in seminomas while AFP is not raised in pure seminomas. Document [9] also mentions that Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be elevated in some cases of seminoma. Document [3] mentions that placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) can be elevated in patients with seminoma. Therefore, all of the options except AFP can be tumor markers for seminoma. However, the question asks for 'the' tumor marker for seminoma, implying a primary or most commonly used marker. Document [27] mentions that serum tumor marker levels did not aid in the early diagnosis of disease relapse in patients with stage I seminoma who were managed with surveillance, indicating that LDH might not be the primary marker. Document [13] mentions that Serum human chorionic gonadotropin is a useful tumor marker in detecting and following non-seminomatous metastases in men with pure seminoma of the testis, indicating that HCG might be the primary marker for seminoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. HCG\"}"
