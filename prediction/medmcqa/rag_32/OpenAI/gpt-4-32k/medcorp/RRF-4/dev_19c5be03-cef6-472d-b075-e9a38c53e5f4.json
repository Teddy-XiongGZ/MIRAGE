    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that affects the spine. According to the documents, the HLA-B27 gene is strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis, with approximately 85% of people with the disease expressing this genotype. However, not everyone with the HLA-B27 gene develops ankylosing spondylitis, so it is not specific to the disease. Sacroiliitis, or inflammation of the sacroiliac joints, is a common symptom of ankylosing spondylitis, but it can also occur in other conditions, so it is not specific to ankylosing spondylitis. A raised ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is a general indicator of inflammation in the body and is not specific to ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, none of the options are specific to ankylosing spondylitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
