    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the body part that is most likely to be injured when a driver wearing a seat belt suddenly applies the brakes to avoid a collision. From the documents, it is clear that the seat belt applies significant force to the body during such an event. Document [0] mentions that the force of inertia of a passenger during a sudden deceleration can be quite high, and the seat belt prevents ejection and secondary impacts within the vehicle. Document [8] also mentions that seatbelt injuries result from forces transmitted from the restraint to the passenger of a vehicle, and underlying structures can be damaged by the subsequent blunt force trauma delivered to the neck, chest, or abdomen. Document [27] mentions the 'seatbelt syndrome', which describes the presence of the seat belt sign plus an intra-abdominal or spinal injury. Therefore, it can be inferred that the abdominal aorta (option D) is most likely to be injured in such a scenario, as it is a major blood vessel in the abdomen that could be affected by the force exerted by the seat belt.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
