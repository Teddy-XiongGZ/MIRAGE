    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tooth that has the highest chance of pulpal exposure if the pulpal floor is made perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. This would depend on the anatomy of the tooth, specifically the location and depth of the pulp relative to the tooth's long axis. Unfortunately, none of the provided documents give specific information about the pulp anatomy of the listed teeth (Maxillary 1st premolar, Maxillary 1st molar, Mandibular 1st premolar, Mandibular 2nd premolar). Therefore, it's not possible to definitively answer this question based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
