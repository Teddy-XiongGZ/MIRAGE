    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) and is hemodynamically unstable, as indicated by the low blood pressure of 70/30 mmHg. Vagal maneuvers and adenosine, which are usually the first-line treatments for PSVT, have failed. According to the documents, when a patient is hemodynamically unstable and does not respond to initial treatments, synchronized cardioversion is recommended. This is a procedure that uses electricity to restore the heart's normal rhythm. Amiodarone is typically used for ventricular arrhythmias and not first-line for PSVT. Repeated adenosine and DC shock are not recommended in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
