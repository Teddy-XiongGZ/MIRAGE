    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents mention that the final steps in the coagulation cascade involve the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin monomers which polymerizes and forms fibrin polymer mesh and result in a cross-linked fibrin clot. This reaction is catalyzed by activated factor XIII (factor XIIIa) that stimulates the lysine and the glutamic acid side chains causing cross-linking of the fibrin molecules and formation of a stabilized clot. Therefore, the extensive cross-linking of blood clot is done by Factor XIII.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
