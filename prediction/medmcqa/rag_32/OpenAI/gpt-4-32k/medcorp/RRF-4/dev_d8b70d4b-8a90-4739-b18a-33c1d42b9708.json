    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The proportion of false positive results among those who test positive is influenced by the prevalence of the disease in the population. If the prevalence of the disease is higher, there will be more true positive results and thus the proportion of false positives among those who test positive will be lower. Therefore, if the proportion of false positive results among those who test positive is lower in population A, it suggests that the prevalence of the disease is higher in population A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
