    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prepare a cavity on a mandibular first molar in a child, we need to anesthetize the area. The mandibular first molar is innervated by the inferior alveolar nerve, which provides sensation to the lower teeth. The long buccal nerve provides sensation to the buccal gingiva and mucosa of the mandible. Therefore, to ensure complete anesthesia in the area of the mandibular first molar, both the inferior alveolar nerve and the long buccal nerve need to be blocked.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Inferior alveolar nerve block and long buccal nerve block\"}"
