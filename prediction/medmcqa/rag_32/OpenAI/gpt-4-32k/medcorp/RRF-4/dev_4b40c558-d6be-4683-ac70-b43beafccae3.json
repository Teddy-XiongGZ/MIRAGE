    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The intelligence quotient (IQ) is a score derived from a set of standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence. The raw score is transformed to a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15. This results in approximately two-thirds of the population scoring between IQ 85 and IQ 115. Therefore, a score of 90-110 falls within this range and is considered average.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Average\"}"
