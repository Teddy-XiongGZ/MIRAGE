    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells. Looking at the documents, Document [0] mentions that ABCG2 is a marker for these cells in a naive state. Document [1] also mentions ABCG2 as a stem cell associated marker. Document [2] mentions ABCG2 as a marker preferentially localized to the limbus. Document [3] mentions ABCG2 as an undifferentiated marker detected only in the basal limbal epithelial cells. Document [4] mentions ABCG2 as a common limbal stem cell marker. Document [7] mentions ABCG2 as a marker that identifies human limbal epithelial stem cells. Document [8] mentions ABCG2 as a useful cell surface marker for the identification and isolation of corneal epithelial stem cells. Document [28] mentions ABCG2 as a marker closely linked to the stem cell phenotype of side population cells. Document [30] mentions ABCG2 as a stem cell marker. Therefore, ABCG2 is the universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
