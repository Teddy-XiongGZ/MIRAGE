    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the lungs due to defects in the heart. Document [0] mentions that patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have elevated right atrial pressure and reduced systemic blood flow. Document [2] also mentions that patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have a higher risk of arrhythmia. Document [3] mentions that patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have greater systemic cardiac indexes and lower mean right atrial pressures than patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Document [5] mentions that the hearts of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome are more like normal fetal hearts than normal adult hearts. Document [6] mentions that myocardial perfusion defects occur in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome. Document [7] defines Eisenmenger's syndrome as a process in which a long-standing left-to-right cardiac shunt caused by a congenital heart defect causes pulmonary hypertension and eventual reversal of the shunt into a cyanotic right-to-left shunt. Document [8] mentions that patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have undergone beneficial physiological adaptations of both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Document [16] mentions that the implementation of ERA in Eisenmenger improves 6-min walking distance and pulmonary vascular pressure indices. Document [27] mentions that patients with Eisenmenger syndrome using a diagnostic-treatment-and-repair strategy are amenable to surgery after successful treatment with advanced therapy. Based on these documents, we can infer that: A. Pulmonary veins are not distended - This is likely true as the condition is characterized by high blood pressure in the lungs and not necessarily distension of the pulmonary veins. B. RV & LV walls come back to normal size - This is likely false as the condition causes changes in the heart that are not likely to revert back to normal. C. Dilatation of central pulmonary artery - This is likely true as the condition causes high blood pressure in the lungs which could lead to dilation of the pulmonary artery. D. Peripheral pruning of pulmonary arteries - This is likely true as the condition causes changes in the pulmonary arteries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
