    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the valvular lesion that most often results from a myocardial infarction. Document [0] mentions that subsequent myocardial infarction was observed in patients with mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation. Document [1] also mentions a case of myocardial infarction possibly caused by coronary thromboembolism due to combined mitral and aortic valvular lesions. However, it does not specify which lesion is more common. Document [9] mentions a case of acute ischemic right-sided valvular disease where the presenting symptom of an infarction was severe tricuspid regurgitation. However, it mentions that this is a rare entity. Document [26] mentions that sinus tachycardia accompanying a myocardial infarction may be indicative of cardiogenic shock. However, it does not specify a particular valvular lesion. Based on the information from these documents, it seems that mitral regurgitation is the most commonly mentioned valvular lesion resulting from myocardial infarction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Mitral regurgitation\"}"
