    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question mentions that the patient has a complete denture and experiences pain while swallowing due to overextension in the distolingual aspect. The distolingual aspect refers to the back and side of the lower jaw. The muscles involved in this area are not the ones listed in the options. However, the document [1] mentions that overextension in the sulcus around the maxillary molar region can cause mucosal trauma as the tissues are trapped between the prosthesis and the zygomatic process of the maxilla. This could potentially cause pain while swallowing. But none of the muscles listed in the options are directly involved in this process. Therefore, none of the options seem to be the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
