    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary action of topical fluoride is to interact with the enamel of the teeth. This interaction leads to the formation of a calcium fluoride layer, which serves as a source of fluoride for the formation of fluorapatite when pH drops in plaque. This process helps in the remineralization of dental hard tissues and makes the enamel more resistant to future acidic challenges. Therefore, the primary action of topical fluoride is not to decrease plaque bacteria or improve the morphology of teeth. It does form a reservoir in saliva, but this is not its primary action. The primary action is the conversion of hydroxyapatite to fluoroapatite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
