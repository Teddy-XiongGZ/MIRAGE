    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Condensation reactions are a type of chemical reaction where two molecules combine to form a larger molecule, usually with the loss of a small molecule such as water. This type of reaction is common in organic chemistry and is essential to the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids and to the biosynthesis of fatty acids. However, none of the provided options (Agar, Alginate, Polysulfide, ZOE) are directly mentioned in the documents as substances where condensation reactions occur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
