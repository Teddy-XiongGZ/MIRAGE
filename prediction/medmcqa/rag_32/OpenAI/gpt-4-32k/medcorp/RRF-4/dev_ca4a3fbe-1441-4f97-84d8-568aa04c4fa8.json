    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a type of inheritance where if the father is affected, no offspring are affected, but if the mother is affected, all offspring are affected. This rules out autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance, as these types of inheritance do not depend on the sex of the parent. X-linked recessive inheritance also doesn't fit the criteria, as in this case, if the father is affected, all daughters will be carriers, but sons will not be affected. However, if the mother is affected, both sons and daughters have a chance of being affected. The only inheritance pattern left is mitochondrial inheritance. In mitochondrial inheritance, all offspring of an affected mother will be affected because mitochondria (and thus mitochondrial DNA) are passed on from mother to offspring. Fathers do not pass on their mitochondria to their offspring, so if a father is affected, none of his offspring will be affected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
