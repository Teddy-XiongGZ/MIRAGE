    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-linking fixatives work by creating covalent bonds that link together different molecules in a tissue sample. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are well-known cross-linking fixatives, as they create covalent bonds between proteins. Methanol, on the other hand, is a precipitating fixative, not a cross-linking one. It works by denaturing proteins and making them insoluble, rather than creating covalent bonds between them. Osmium tetroxide is not mentioned in the documents, so I need to rely on external knowledge for this. Osmium tetroxide is a fixative used in electron microscopy, primarily to preserve lipids. It does not function by cross-linking proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
