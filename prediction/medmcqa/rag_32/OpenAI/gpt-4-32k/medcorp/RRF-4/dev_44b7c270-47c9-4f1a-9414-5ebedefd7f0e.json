    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Indirect retention is a concept used in denture design. According to Document [4], indirect retention is required to prevent displacement of saddles, such as free-end saddles or anterior saddle which is curved outside a straight line between the abutment teeth. This suggests that indirect retention is used to resist movement of the denture. Document [23] also supports this, stating that a unilateral vertical dislodging force applied to a distal-extension removable partial denture is transmitted to the supporting structures with a vertical and horizontal component, and the presence of indirect retainers reduces the stress to the primary abutment teeth. This suggests that indirect retention is designed to resist dislodgement of an extension base partial denture in the occlusal direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
