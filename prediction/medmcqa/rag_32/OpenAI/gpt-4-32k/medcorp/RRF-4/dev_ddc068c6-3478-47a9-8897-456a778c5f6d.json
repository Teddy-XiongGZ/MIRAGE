    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the developmental stage of the 2nd mandibular molar at the age of 12. According to Document [25], the permanent second molars erupt between 11 to 13 years of age. This suggests that by the age of 12, the crown of the 2nd mandibular molar should be complete. However, the document does not provide specific information about the root development at this age. Document [12] provides more specific information, stating that in 10-year-olds, 6% of the first mandibular molars had incomplete roots, and even in the 11-year-old children, 4% had incomplete roots. This suggests that by the age of 12, the root of the 2nd mandibular molar should be mostly developed, but the apex might still be open.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
