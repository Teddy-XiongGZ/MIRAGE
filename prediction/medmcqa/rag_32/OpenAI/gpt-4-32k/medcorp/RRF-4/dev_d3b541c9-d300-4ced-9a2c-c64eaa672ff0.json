    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of recurrent vomiting and polyuria, along with the laboratory findings of high blood calcium and PTH levels, reduced urinary calcium excretion, and bilateral nephrocalcinosis on ultrasound, suggest a disorder related to calcium metabolism. Bartter syndrome, choice A, is characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and normal to low blood pressure, which does not match this patient's presentation. Pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism, choice C, is characterized by normal PTH and calcium levels, which also does not match this patient's presentation. Parathyroid adenoma, choice D, could cause hypercalcemia and elevated PTH, but it is extremely rare in infants and wouldn't explain the reduced urinary calcium excretion. On the other hand, a mutation of the calcium sensing receptor, choice B, can cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a condition characterized by mild to moderate hypercalcemia, relative hypocalciuria, and normal to mildly elevated PTH, which matches this patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
