    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the pulp horns that are likely to get exposed during a Class II cavity preparation on a maxillary first molar. Document [3] mentions that for both genders it should be noted that the mesiobuccal pulp horn is most likely to get exposed during cavity preparation. This gives us one of the pulp horns. Document [6] also mentions that in preparation of cavities in maxillary second deciduous molars, care is necessary not to expose the mesiobuccal pulp horn. Although this document talks about deciduous molars, it still gives us a hint that the mesiobuccal pulp horn is sensitive and likely to get exposed. Therefore, the answer should include the mesiobuccal pulp horn.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Mesiolingual and mesiobuccal\"}"
