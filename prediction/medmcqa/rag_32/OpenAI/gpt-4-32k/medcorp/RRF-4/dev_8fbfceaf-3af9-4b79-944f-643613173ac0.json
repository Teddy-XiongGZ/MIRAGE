    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the long-term complications of infants born to mothers with Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). Document [0] mentions that infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are not at an increased risk for long-term endocrine morbidity, which includes insulin and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemia, and obesity.

Therefore, based on the available documents, it is not possible to definitively choose an answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Information not available in the provided documents\"}"
