    "First, I will review the documents to understand the contraindications for spinal and epidural anaesthesia. From Document [0], I learned that contraindications for spinal anaesthesia include bleeding disorders, thrombocytopaenia, systemic anticoagulation, increased intracranial pressure, and local infection or sepsis at the site of injection. Document [13] also mentions that the risk of epidural haematomas after neuraxial blockade is dependent on abnormal anatomy of the spine, difficult and multiple punctures, and coagulation disorders. Especially when patients undergo therapy with anticoagulants like low molecular heparin or platelet inhibitors (tyclopidine) or a combination of them, the indication for neuraxial blockade must strictly outweigh the risk of spinal bleeding. Document [18] also mentions that epidural and spinal blocks can lead to iatrogenic bleeding in the spinal canal, and the perioperative risk is higher in patients under anticoagulant therapy. From Document [27], I learned that injection of spinal anaesthesia higher than the level of L1 can cause damage to the spinal cord, and is therefore usually not done. From these documents, it is clear that patients with low platelet count (Choice A), patients on oral anticoagulants (Choice C), and patients with raised intracranial pressure (Choice D) are contraindicated for spinal and epidural anaesthesia due to the increased risk of bleeding and damage to the spinal cord. However, Document [0] does not mention aspirin as a contraindication for spinal anaesthesia. Therefore, the answer is Choice B: Patient on aspirin. The final output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I reviewed the documents to understand the contraindications for spinal and epidural anaesthesia.
