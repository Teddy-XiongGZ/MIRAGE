    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The beveling of occlusal margins in an amalgam cavity preparation is not recommended due to the properties of the amalgam. The document [16] mentions that 'Creep or plastic deformation happens when subjected to intra-oral stresses such as chewing or grinding. Creep causes the amalgam to flow and protrudes from the margin of the cavity forming unsupported edges. \"Ditch\" is formed around the margins of the amalgam restoration after fracture due to amalgam creep at the occlusal margins.' This suggests that the property of amalgam that makes it undesirable to bevel occlusal margins of an amalgam cavity preparation is its ability to flow or 'creep' under stress, leading to the formation of unsupported edges and ditches.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
