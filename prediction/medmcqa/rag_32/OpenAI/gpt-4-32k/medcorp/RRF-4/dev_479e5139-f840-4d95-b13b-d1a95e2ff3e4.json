    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the organ most radiosensitive in the pelvic region when treated with pelvic external beam irradiation. Radiosensitivity refers to the susceptibility of cells, tissues, or organs to damage from radiation. Looking at the documents, there is no direct mention of the ovary being affected by radiation. The vagina is mentioned in several documents, but mostly in the context of it being a site of recurrence for endometrial carcinoma, not necessarily as being radiosensitive. The bladder is mentioned in a few documents, but not extensively in the context of radiosensitivity. The rectum, however, is mentioned in several documents as being affected by radiation therapy, with mentions of complications such as proctitis and bowel obstruction. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the rectum seems to be the most radiosensitive organ in the pelvic region when treated with pelvic external beam irradiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Rectum\"}"
