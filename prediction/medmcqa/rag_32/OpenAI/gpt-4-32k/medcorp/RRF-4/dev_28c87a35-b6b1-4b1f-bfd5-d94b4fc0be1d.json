    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a statistical test that indicates the probability of an observed difference between two means occurring by chance. From the documents, we can see that statistical tests are used to determine if the observed differences are due to chance or not. Specifically, tests of significance are used to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant or not, which means they are unlikely to have occurred by chance. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Tests of significance'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
