    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what high copper dental amalgams are. From Document [3], I learned that high copper dental amalgams are amalgams made from alloys containing copper in excess of 6 per cent by weight. The document also mentions that high copper amalgams show 'superior' physical properties and clinical performance to low copper amalgams. Now, I need to find out why high copper dental amalgams are superior. Document [3] again provides useful information, stating that improved clinical performance (less marginal breakdown) has been related to low creep, little or no gamma 2 phase and the presence of zinc in high copper amalgams. This information matches with option A. The other documents do not provide information that matches with the other options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
