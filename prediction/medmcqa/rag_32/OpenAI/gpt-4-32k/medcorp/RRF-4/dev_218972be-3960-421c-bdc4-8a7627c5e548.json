    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to consider the vaccines that are typically administered to children around 18 months of age. According to Document [0], Hepatitis A vaccine is given to children aged 12 through 23 months. Document [2] suggests that Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is given at ages 2, 4, 6\u201318 months. Document [3] indicates that Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is given at ages 2, 4, 6 months with a booster at age 12 through 15 months. Document [4] suggests that Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is given at ages 2, 4, 6, 15\u201318 months. Document [5] suggests that Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is given at age 12 through 15 months, and the second dose at age 4 through 6 years. Therefore, for an 18-month-old child who has never been vaccinated before, the vaccines to be administered would be Hepatitis A, IPV, PCV, DTaP, and MMR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. DPT, OPV and MMR\"}"
