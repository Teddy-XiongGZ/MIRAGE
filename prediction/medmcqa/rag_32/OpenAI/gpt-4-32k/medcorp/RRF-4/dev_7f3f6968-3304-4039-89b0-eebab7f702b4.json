The H band and A line are parts of the sarcomere, but they are not the parts that contract. The sarcoplasm is the cytoplasm of a muscle cell and is not directly involved in contraction. The sarcomere, on the other hand, is the basic unit of a muscle fiber that contracts. It is made up of actin and myosin filaments that slide past each other to cause muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
