    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to find information about the most common complications during ridge split or bone spreading procedures. Document [1] mentions that severe complications can result from ridge expansion techniques, but it does not specify what these complications are. Document [4] mentions a case of bad split and buccal fenestration as complications. Document [8] mentions perforations and fractures of the cortical bone as potential complications. Document [9] mentions the risk of cortical plate fracture during the ridge expansion process. Document [14] mentions buccal wall fracture as the most frequent postoperative complication, followed by postoperative ridge resorption. Document [19] mentions bad split and wound dehiscence as minor surgical complications. Document [26] mentions mal fracture as a complication during the split-crest technique. Document [28] mentions that the incidence of peri-implant bone resorption for the AOGB technique was higher than that for the ARS technique. Based on these documents, it seems that facial plate splitting or buccal wall fracture is the most commonly mentioned complication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
