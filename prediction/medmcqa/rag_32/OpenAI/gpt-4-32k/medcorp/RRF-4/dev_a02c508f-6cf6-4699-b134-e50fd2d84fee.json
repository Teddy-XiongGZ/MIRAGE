    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve that passes through the foramen ovale. It provides sensory innervation to the lower teeth, lower lip, and some skin on the lower face, as well as motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. Therefore, injury to the right mandibular nerve would not affect taste sensation or tongue movement, which are functions of the facial and hypoglossal nerves, respectively. It would also not cause deviation of the chin when the mouth is opened, as this is a function of the muscles of mastication, which are innervated by both sides of the mandibular nerve. However, it would cause loss of general sensation to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, which is innervated by the lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
