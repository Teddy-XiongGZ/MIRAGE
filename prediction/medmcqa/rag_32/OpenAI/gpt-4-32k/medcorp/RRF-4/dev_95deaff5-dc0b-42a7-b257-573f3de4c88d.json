    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Document [0], loss of bone mineral density per year was 1.97 mg/ml and 2.09 mg/ml for females in the trabecular and cortical bone compartments, respectively. A 70-year-old female loses 56.7% and 31.3% of the bone mass at 20 years of age for the trabecular and cortical compartments, respectively. Most loss in bone mass was observed in the premenopausal and early postmenopausal period. In the postmenopausal period, duration of menopause had more effect on bone mass than age. Document [1] states that peak bone mass is the maximum amount of bone a person has during their life. It typically occurs in the early 20s in females. Document [2] states that average females stop growing taller two years earlier than average males. Document [3] states that by age 22.1 +/- 2.5 years, 99% of peak BMD is attained. Document [10] states that the T-score is the relevant measure when screening for osteoporosis. It is a comparison of a patient's BMD to that of a healthy 30-year-old. The criteria of the World Health Organization are: Normal is a T-score of \u22121.0 or higher Osteopenia is defined as between \u22121.0 and \u22122.5 Osteoporosis is defined as \u22122.5 or lower. Document [15] states that almost half of the sample population had decreased BMD. Peri and postmenopausal women constitute a high-risk group for osteoporosis and future fractures. Considering all these documents, it seems that the best age to start bone mineral density test in females would be after 50 years, as this is the age where most women enter menopause and start losing bone mass at a higher rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
