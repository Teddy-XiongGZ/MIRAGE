    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome (MPDS) is a condition that affects the muscles and joints involved in jaw movement. Document [1] indicates that it affects both males and females, but it is more common in females. Document [24] suggests that oral habits such as grinding and clenching can contribute to the development of MPDS, which aligns with choice B. Document [10] and [31] mention that treatment often involves the use of an occlusal guard and stress management, which supports choice C. However, I did not find any information in the documents suggesting that the perioral musculature becomes hypotonic (weakened) in MPDS. In fact, Document [4] suggests that the muscles may become hyperactive, not hypotonic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
