    "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking which statement about phenotype is not true. Step 2: Review each choice in light of the documents. Choice A: Document [25] suggests that phenotypes can change over time due to both genetic and non-genetic influences. So, this statement is true. Choice B: Document [23] defines phenotype as the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism, which includes its appearance. So, this statement is true. Choice C: Document [9] and [12] clearly distinguish between genotype and phenotype, stating that genotype is an organism's full hereditary information, while phenotype is an organism's actual observed properties. So, this statement is false. Choice D: Document [23] and [12] also state that an organism's phenotype results from the expression of an organism's genetic code, or its genotype. So, this statement is true. Step 3: Choose the false statement. The false statement is Choice C: It is genetic sequence of an individual. So, the answer is Choice C. Output in json: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I reviewed each choice in light of the documents. I found that phenotype can change over time, it includes the appearance of an individual, and it is influenced by genotype. However, phenotype is not the genetic sequence of an individual. That is the definition of genotype.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
