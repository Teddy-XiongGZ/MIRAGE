    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I will look for information about the half-life of rifabutin and rifampicin. Document [2] and [8] mention that rifabutin has a longer half-life than rifampicin, so option A is true. Next, I will look for information about the incidence of drug interactions. Document [3] and [1] mention that rifabutin has fewer drug interactions than rifampicin, so option B is true. Then, I will look for information about the efficacy of rifabutin and rifampicin against MAC. Document [3] and [24] mention that rifabutin is effective against MAC, but they do not compare it to rifampicin. However, there is no information suggesting that rifabutin is more efficacious against MAC than rifampicin, so I cannot confirm or deny option C. Finally, I will look for information about the efficacy of rifabutin and rifampicin for pulmonary TB. Document [0] and [31] mention that rifabutin and rifampicin have similar efficacy for pulmonary TB, so option D is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
