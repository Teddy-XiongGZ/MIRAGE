    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phenylbutyrate is used in the treatment of urea cycle disorders. According to the documents, it works by creating alternative pathways for nitrogen excretion. This is achieved through the formation of phenylacetylglutamine, which is readily excreted in the urine. This process helps to remove excess nitrogen from the body, which is crucial in managing urea cycle disorders. Therefore, the role of phenylbutyrate in the management of urea cycle disorders is to scavenge nitrogen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Scavenges nitrogen\"}"
