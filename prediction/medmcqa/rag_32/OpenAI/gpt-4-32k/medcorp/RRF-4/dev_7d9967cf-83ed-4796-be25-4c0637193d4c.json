    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The absolute refractory period of a neuron is the time during which another action potential is impossible, regardless of the strength of the stimulus. This period is due to the state of the sodium channels in the neuron. After an action potential, these channels become inactivated and cannot be reopened until the membrane is repolarized. Therefore, the absolute refractoriness of a neuron is due to the closure of inactivated sodium channels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
