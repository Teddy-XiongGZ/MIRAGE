    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Excessive occlusal forces refer to forces which exceed the limits of tissue adaptation, therefore causing occlusal trauma. According to Document [5], there are two types of occlusal trauma, primary and secondary. Primary occlusal trauma occurs when greater than normal occlusal forces are placed on teeth with a normal periodontal attachment apparatus and, thus, no periodontal disease. Secondary occlusal trauma occurs when normal or excessive occlusal forces are placed on teeth with compromised periodontal attachment, thus contributing harm to an already damaged system. Therefore, excessive occlusal forces cannot be superimposed in cases with a normal periodontium and normal height of bone because this would result in primary occlusal trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
