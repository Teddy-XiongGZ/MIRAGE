    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each type of corrosion means. Electrochemical corrosion occurs when a metal material corrodes due to a reaction with some form of electrolyte. Chemical corrosion is a process where a solid, especially a metal, is eaten away and changed by a chemical reaction. Penetrating corrosion, also known as uniform or general attack corrosion, is the most common type of corrosion and is characterized by a uniform thinning of the material. Now, I need to look at the documents to see which type of corrosion does not occur in High Copper Amalgam. Document [17] mentions that high copper amalgam becomes more noble, which means it is less likely to corrode. Document [28] also mentions that high-copper amalgam exhibited better resistance to corrosion than the low-copper alloy. However, none of the documents explicitly state that a specific type of corrosion does not occur in High Copper Amalgam. Therefore, the answer should be 'Corrosion does not occur at all' since it is the only option that contradicts the information in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Corrosion does not occur at all\"}"
