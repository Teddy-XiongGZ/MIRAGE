    "The documents provided do not specify an ideal time for non-stress test monitoring in terms of hours (24, 48, 72, or 96 hours). However, they do mention that non-stress tests are commonly used from 32 weeks of gestation to term to evaluate fetal health (Document [0], Document [1], Document [3], Document [5], Document [8]). They also mention that the frequency of use is based on clinical judgment and can be used more frequently in high-risk pregnancies (Document [2], Document [4], Document [16], Document [22], Document [25], Document [27], Document [29], Document [30]). Therefore, none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) can be definitively chosen based on the information given in the documents. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The documents do not provide a specific ideal time in hours for non-stress test monitoring in a non-diabetic high-risk pregnancy.
