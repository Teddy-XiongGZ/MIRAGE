    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The CRISPR-Cas9 system works by creating double-strand breaks at target sites in the DNA. The cell then repairs these breaks, and it is this repair process that allows for genome editing. According to Document [1], the double-strand break is repaired by either non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair cellular mechanisms. Therefore, the answer should be either non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. However, only one of these options is provided in the choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Homologous repair\"}"
