    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intracoronal bleaching can affect the bond strength of composite restorations if they are placed immediately after the bleaching procedure. This is due to the residual oxygen left from the bleaching process. However, the use of antioxidants such as sodium ascorbate has been shown to neutralize this residual oxygen and improve bond strength. Therefore, treating the bleached tooth with an antioxidant could allow for immediate composite restoration. The use of catalase is not mentioned in the documents. Waiting for 7 days is not mandatory, as some studies suggest that a delay of 3 days is sufficient. Treating with H2O2 for 3 minutes is not mentioned in the documents and does not seem to be a recommended procedure. Therefore, the statement that immediate composite restoration is not possible after intracoronal bleaching is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
