    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mother is a known case of chronic hepatitis B infection and is positive for HBsAG but negative for HBeAG. This means that the baby is at risk of contracting the virus from the mother. Document [3] suggests that antivirals treatment in HBV carrier mothers from 28 weeks of gestation along with active and passive immunization of the newborn may interrupt mother-to-child transmission of HBV efficiently. Document [4] also supports the use of passive plus active immunization as an effective procedure for preventing perinatally transmitted HBV infection. Document [16] also suggests that the combination of vaccination and HBIG in the infants delivered by HBeAg-positive mothers reduced the rate of perinatal transmission of HBV. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for the baby would be both active and passive immunization soon after birth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
