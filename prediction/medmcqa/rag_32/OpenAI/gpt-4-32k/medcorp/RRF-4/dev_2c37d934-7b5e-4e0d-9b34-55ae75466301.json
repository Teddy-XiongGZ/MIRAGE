    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, a radical neck dissection involves the removal of all ipsilateral cervical lymph node groups from levels I through V, together with the spinal accessory nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and internal jugular vein. Therefore, the spinal accessory nerve (option A) is removed in a radical neck dissection. The documents do not mention the removal of the submandibular (option B), tail of parotid (option C), or level 2 b lymph nodes (option D) specifically. However, since the radical neck dissection involves the removal of all lymph node groups from levels I through V, it can be inferred that level 2 b lymph nodes (option D) would be removed. Therefore, the structures that are not specifically mentioned as being removed in a radical neck dissection are the submandibular and tail of parotid. However, the tail of parotid is not typically considered part of the neck, so it is less likely to be involved in a neck dissection. Therefore, the most likely answer is that the tail of parotid (option C) is not removed in a radical neck dissection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
