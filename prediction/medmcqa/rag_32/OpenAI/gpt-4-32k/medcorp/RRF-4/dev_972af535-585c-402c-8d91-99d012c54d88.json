    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific term related to Removable Partial Dentures (R.P.D). The term refers to how one part of the R.P.D opposes the action of the retainer during function. From my knowledge and the provided documents, the term that fits this description is 'Reciprocation'. Reciprocation in dentistry refers to the mutual exchange in which the retentive arm moves towards the tissue and the reciprocal arm moves away from the tissue, and vice versa. This helps to prevent any harmful movements or forces being applied to the teeth and tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
