    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental plaque is a biofilm that attaches to tooth surfaces. This attachment is facilitated by the formation of an acquired pellicle, a layer of saliva composed mainly of glycoproteins, on the tooth surface. Bacteria then attach to this pellicle layer. The documents do not mention levans or dextrans as being responsible for the adherence of dental plaque to the tooth. They also do not mention that plaque grows into the irregularities of the tooth. However, they do mention that microorganisms produce proteins and glycoproteins that facilitate their attachment to the tooth surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Microorganisms produce sticky lipoproteins\"}"
