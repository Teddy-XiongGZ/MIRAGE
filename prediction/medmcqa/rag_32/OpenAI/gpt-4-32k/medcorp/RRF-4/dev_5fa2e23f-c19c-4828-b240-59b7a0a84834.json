    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ideal temperature in the delivery room for neonates to be kept in a warmer is mentioned in several documents. Document [1] suggests that the operating rooms are usually warmed to 78 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit before patient arrival. Converting this to Celsius gives approximately 25.5 to 26.6 degrees Celsius. Document [3] suggests that the appropriate room temperature for naked and untouched neonates is 37-38 degrees Celsius. However, this seems to be too high compared to other documents. Document [7] suggests increasing the temperature in the room to \u226523 \u00b0C. Document [15] suggests providing a warmer delivery room (>25\u00b0C). Document [21] suggests that the labour room temperature should be set at a higher level. Document [29] suggests increasing delivery room/operating room temperatures. Considering all these documents, it seems that the temperature should be warm but not too hot, which makes option B the most reasonable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
