    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formocresol pulpotomy technique involves applying a cotton pellet to the pulp stumps. According to Document [0], the cotton pellet is dampened with full strength formocresol. However, it does not specify whether the cotton pellet should be slightly dampened or saturated. Document [12] also mentions a 1-minute full-strength formocresol technique, but it does not provide specific details about the dampness of the cotton pellet. None of the documents mention leaving the cotton pellet in the cavity for 2 hours or sealing it until the next appointment. Therefore, based on the available information, the cotton pellet should be dampened with formocresol, but it is not clear whether it should be slightly dampened or saturated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Slightly dampened with formocresol\"}"
