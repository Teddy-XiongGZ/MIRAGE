GBS is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The classic symptoms are weakness and tingling in the legs. In many instances, the weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase in intensity until the muscles cannot be used at all. When severe, the person is almost totally paralyzed. However, the question asks for the first investigation to be done. In such a case, it is important to rule out electrolyte imbalances that could also cause muscle weakness. Among the options given, serum potassium (Choice A) would be a relevant first-line investigation, as abnormal potassium levels can cause muscle weakness and paralysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
