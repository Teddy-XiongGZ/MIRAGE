    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the layer of the gingiva that receives increased blood supply due to gingival massage. The gingiva is composed of an outer epithelial layer and an underlying connective tissue layer called the lamina propria. The epithelial layer can be further divided into the outer epidermis and the inner basal layer. Document [0] mentions that gingival massage improves blood circulation, but it does not specify the layer. However, considering the structure of the gingiva, it is logical to assume that the increased blood flow would affect all layers of the gingiva, including the epidermis, basal layer, and lamina propria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above\"}"
