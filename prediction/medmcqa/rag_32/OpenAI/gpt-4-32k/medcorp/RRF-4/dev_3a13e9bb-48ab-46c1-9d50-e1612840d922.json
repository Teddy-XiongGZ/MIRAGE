    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the likely cause of a patient going into shock immediately after normal delivery. Document [0] mentions that amniotic fluid embolism can cause nonhemorrhagic primary obstetric shock, which can occur during delivery. Document [16] also mentions that hemorrhagic shock, severe preeclampsia and eclampsia, and amniotic fluid embolism are major obstetric causes of maternal cardiac arrest. Document [22] mentions that hemorrhagic shock in obstetrics is often due to bleeding. Document [24] mentions that preeclampsia can cause shock and death postpartum. Document [29] mentions that the most frequent kind of shock seen by obstetricians is the hypovolemic type, often due to bleeding. Document [31] mentions that shell shock is not relevant to this context. Considering all these, the most likely cause of shock immediately after normal delivery could be due to Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) which is a common cause of hypovolemic shock due to excessive bleeding after delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
