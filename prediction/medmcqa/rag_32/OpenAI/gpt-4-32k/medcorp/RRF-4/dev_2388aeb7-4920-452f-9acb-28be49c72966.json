    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autoinfection is a process where a parasite can complete its entire life cycle within a single host, leading to a continuous build-up of the parasite's burden in the host. From the documents, it is clear that Strongyloides stercoralis and Hymenolepis nana can cause autoinfection (Document 0, Document 1, Document 7, Document 21). However, there is no mention of Enterobius vermicularis, Taenia solium, or Ascaris lumbricoides causing autoinfection. Therefore, I need to choose between these three options. Ascaris lumbricoides is mentioned in Document 31, but it is in the context of diagnosis, not autoinfection. Therefore, the answer should be either Enterobius vermicularis or Taenia solium. Since there is no information about these two in the context of autoinfection, I will choose the one that is less likely to cause autoinfection based on general knowledge. Taenia solium, a tapeworm, typically requires an intermediate host to complete its life cycle, making autoinfection unlikely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Taenia solium\"}"
