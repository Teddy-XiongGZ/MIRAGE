    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the preferred method of intubation in a patient with oral and maxillofacial trauma where a cervical injury has not been ruled out. Document [1] states that the method of intubation in these patients remains a controversial topic, but nasotracheal intubation and tracheotomies can be performed. However, these procedures have complications. Document [2] suggests that nasotracheal intubation can be used in these cases. Document [21] states that both nasal and oral intubation have advantages and disadvantages, but in trauma patients, the oral route should be preferred with cervical immobilization. Document [24] suggests that in cases of maxillofacial trauma, the airway should be managed with due consideration to the spine. Document [26] suggests that submental intubation is a reliable technique for operative airway management in maxillofacial trauma patients. However, none of the documents suggest the use of LMA, Combitube, or normal laryngoscopy & endotracheal intubation as the preferred method in these cases. Document [19] suggests that fiberoptic intubation can be used in these cases. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the preferred method of intubation in a patient with oral and maxillofacial trauma where a cervical injury has not been ruled out would be fiberoptic intubation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Fiberoptic intubation\"}"
