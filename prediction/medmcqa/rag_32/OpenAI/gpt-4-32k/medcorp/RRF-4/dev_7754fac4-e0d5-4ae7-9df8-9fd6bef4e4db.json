    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Incidence is a measure of the probability of occurrence of a given medical condition in a population within a specified period of time (Document [24]). It is calculated by dividing the number of new cases during a given period by the number of subjects at risk in the population initially at risk at the beginning of the study (Document [24]). Therefore, the statement D is true. If a programme is effective in preventing a disease, it would decrease the number of new cases, thus decreasing the incidence (A). Similarly, vaccination strategies would prevent new cases of a disease, thus decreasing its incidence (B). However, newer and effective treatment modalities would not decrease the incidence of a disease. They would decrease the prevalence of a disease, which is the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a given time (Document [19]). Treatment does not prevent new cases, but it can cure existing cases, reducing the prevalence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
