    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to find information about the discontinuation syndrome of each drug. Document [21] mentions that the abrupt discontinuation of an SNRI, such as Venlafaxine, usually leads to withdrawal, or 'discontinuation syndrome', which could include states of anxiety and insomnia. Document [2] mentions that discontinuation symptoms of tricyclics, which include Imipramine, can include anxiety and insomnia. I couldn't find any specific information about the discontinuation syndrome of Valproate and Olanzapine in the provided documents. Therefore, based on the available information, both Venlafaxine and Imipramine can result in anxiety and insomnia causing discontinuation syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A and B\"}"
