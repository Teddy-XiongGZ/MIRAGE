    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to understand what each type of lipase does and how it is regulated. From Document [28], I learned that lipoprotein lipase is upregulated by high levels of glucagon. Document [24] suggests that there is no evidence that glucagon has any effect on lipolysis in white adipose tissue, which is where hormone-sensitive lipase is active. Document [18] suggests that glucagon-like peptide-1 inhibits gastric lipase secretion. Document [26] suggests that in the absence of pancreatic lipase, gastric lipase can partly compensate for the loss of pancreatic lipase but does not normalize overall lipolytic activity. Therefore, based on these documents, it seems that lipoprotein lipase is the type of lipase that is controlled by glucagon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
