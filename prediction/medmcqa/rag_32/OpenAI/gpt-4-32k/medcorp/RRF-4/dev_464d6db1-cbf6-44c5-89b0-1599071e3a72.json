    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The angle of the jaw is innervated by the auricular branch of the superficial cervical plexus (SCP) as per Document [13]. The mandibular nerve carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3) as per Document [2]. Therefore, the mandibular nerve does not supply the angle of the jaw. The maxillary nerve supplies the upper jaw as per Document [1], so it does not supply the angle of the jaw. The lesser occipital nerve is not mentioned in the documents. The greater auricular nerve is not mentioned in the documents either. Therefore, none of the options are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
