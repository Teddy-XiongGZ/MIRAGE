    "The question is asking about the syndromes that are not associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor in a 6-year-old patient. The documents provided do not mention any of the syndromes listed in the answer choices. Therefore, to answer this question, I would need to rely on my medical knowledge or additional resources outside of the provided documents. Based on my medical knowledge, an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor, also known as a talon cusp, is not typically associated with any of the syndromes listed in the answer choices. However, Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome is known to cause a variety of dental anomalies, which could potentially include an extra cusp. Therefore, the syndromes that are not associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor would be Mohr's syndrome, Sturge-Weber Syndrome, and Proteus Syndrome. So, the answer is all except Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the syndromes that are not associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor in a 6-year-old patient.
