    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn presents with congestive heart failure and a bulging anterior fontanelle with a bruit on auscultation. This suggests increased intracranial pressure and a vascular anomaly. The transfontanellar USG shows a hypoechoic midline mass with dilated lateral ventricles, which indicates a vascular malformation rather than a solid tumor or cyst. Document [2] and Document [9] mention that the Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) can present with high-output cardiac failure and a fontanel bruit in neonates. Document [1] also mentions that arteriovenous malformations like VGAM can cause heart failure in newborns and can be diagnosed with head ultrasound. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Vein of Galen malformation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
