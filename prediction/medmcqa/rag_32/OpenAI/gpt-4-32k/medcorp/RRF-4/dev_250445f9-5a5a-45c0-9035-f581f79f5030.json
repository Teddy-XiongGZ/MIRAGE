    "Step 1: Identify the relevant documents that contain information about the hormonal changes in polycystic ovarian disease. Step 2: Document [27] mentions that polycystic ovarian disease involves altered functions of the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary and adrenal glands, but it does not specify the hormonal changes. Step 3: Document [15] mentions that polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by excess levels of circulating androgens and by chronic anovulation, and women with polycystic ovary syndrome are known to be uniquely insulin resistant. However, it does not mention the specific hormones in the question. Step 4: Document [19] mentions that in addition to menstrual dysfunction and hyperandrogenism, women with polycystic ovary syndrome also may have hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities, but it does not mention the specific hormones in the question. Step 5: None of the documents provide specific information about the levels of LH, FSH, Dheas, and prolactin in polycystic ovarian disease. Based on the information available in the documents, it is not possible to definitively answer the question. However, generally, polycystic ovarian syndrome is associated with increased levels of LH, a higher LH/FSH ratio, and increased Dheas. It is not typically associated with increased prolactin. Therefore, the answer is likely D. Increased prolactin. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"I first identified the relevant documents that might contain information about the hormonal changes in polycystic ovarian disease.
