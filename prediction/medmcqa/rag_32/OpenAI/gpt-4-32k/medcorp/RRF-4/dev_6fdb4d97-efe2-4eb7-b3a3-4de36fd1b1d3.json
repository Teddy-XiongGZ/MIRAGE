    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the factors that determine the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). From the documents, it is clear that GFR is determined by several factors including serum creatinine, age, ethnicity, and gender (Document 0). However, these factors are not listed in the answer choices. The answer choices provided seem to be related to the physiological aspects of kidney function, specifically the resistance in the afferent and efferent arterioles. Afferent arteriolar resistance and efferent arteriolar resistance are indeed factors that can influence GFR as they can affect the pressure within the glomerulus and thus the rate of filtration. However, 'aerial pressure' is not a term related to kidney function or GFR. Therefore, it cannot be a factor determining GFR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Afferent aeriolar resistance, B. Efferent aeriolar resistance\"}"
