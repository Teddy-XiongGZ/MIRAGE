    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An episiotomy is a surgical incision made in the perineum to enlarge the vaginal opening during childbirth. There are two main types of episiotomies: midline and mediolateral. According to the documents, midline episiotomies are associated with a higher risk of severe perineal lacerations compared to mediolateral episiotomies. Document [6] states that midline episiotomies resulted in more deep perineal tears compared to mediolateral episiotomies. Document [23] also supports this, stating that selective midline episiotomy resulted in a higher risk of third-degree perineal lacerations. Therefore, the advantage of a mediolateral episiotomy over a midline episiotomy would be a lesser chance of extension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
