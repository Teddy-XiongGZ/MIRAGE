    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The half-life of a substance refers to the time it takes for the concentration of that substance to decrease by half. According to Document [0], active TGF-beta 1 has a very short plasma half-life in rats (2-3 min). However, TGF-beta 1 in the latent complex had a greatly extended plasma half-life (greater than 100 min). The question does not specify whether it is referring to the active or latent form of TGF-beta. However, since the options provided do not include a half-life of greater than 100 min, it can be assumed that the question is referring to the active form of TGF-beta.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
