    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has bilateral conductive deafness, tinnitus, and a positive family history. Conductive hearing loss occurs when sound is not conducted efficiently through the outer ear canal to the eardrum and the tiny bones, or ossicles, of the middle ear. Tinnitus is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears. A common problem, tinnitus affects about 15 to 20 percent of people. Tinnitus isn't a condition itself \u2014 it's a symptom of an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, ear injury or a circulatory system disorder. A positive family history suggests a genetic component to the condition. Otospongiosis, also known as otosclerosis, is a common cause of conductive hearing loss, particularly in adults. It is a disease of the bone surrounding the inner ear. It can cause hearing loss when this bone prevents structures within the ear from working properly. In many cases, an abnormal growth of bone develops around the stapes (the smallest bone in the body), where it attaches to the cochlea. Otosclerosis usually causes a conductive hearing loss, a hearing loss caused by a problem in the outer or middle ear. Less frequently, otosclerosis may cause a sensorineural hearing loss (damaged sensory cells and/or nerve fibers of the inner ear), as well as a conductive hearing loss. Tympanosclerosis refers to calcification of the tissues in the middle ear, usually as a result of chronic otitis media. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can lead to dizzy spells (vertigo) and hearing loss. In most cases, Meniere's disease affects only one ear. Bilateral otitis media is inflammation of the middle ear, affecting both ears. Considering the symptoms and the family history, the most likely diagnosis is Otospongiosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
