    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the most appropriate statistical test to compare the difference in heights of school children among three socio-economic groups. The Student's 't' test is used to compare the means of two groups, so it's not suitable for comparing three groups. The Chi-squared test is used for categorical data, not for comparing means of groups. The Paired 't' test is used to compare the means of the same group at two different times. The One way analysis of variance (one way ANOVA) is used to compare the means of three or more groups, which fits the scenario described in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
