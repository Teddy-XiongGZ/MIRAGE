    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Balanced resuscitation in trauma management refers to a comprehensive approach that includes permissive hypotension, limiting crystalloid use, and transfusing blood products in ratios similar to whole blood. It aims to minimize trauma-induced coagulopathy, reduce blood product waste, and decrease complications associated with aggressive crystalloid resuscitation. The given options can be evaluated based on this information. Option A, giving colloids and crystalloids in a ratio of 1:1, is not specifically mentioned in the documents as part of balanced resuscitation. Option B, maintaining pH by ensuring acid-base balance, is not the primary focus of balanced resuscitation. Option C, maintaining permissive hypotension to avoid bleeding, is mentioned in the documents as part of balanced resuscitation. Option D, maintaining airway breathing and circulation simultaneously, is a general principle of resuscitation but not specific to balanced resuscitation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Maintaining permissive hypotension to avoid bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
