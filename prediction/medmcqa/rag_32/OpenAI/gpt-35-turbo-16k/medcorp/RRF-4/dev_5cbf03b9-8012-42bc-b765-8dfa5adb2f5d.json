    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine when a lingual plate is indicated, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. According to Document [0], the indications for a lingual plate include a depth of lingual vestibule less than 7mm, additional loss of teeth anticipated, presence of a torus mandibularis, and the need to replace all posterior teeth bilaterally. However, Document [2] mentions that a lingual plate is useful when there is insufficient space for a lingual bar, and Document [10] states that a disadvantage of a lingual plate is that it covers a lot of gingival margins and is less hygienic than a lingual bar. Based on this information, we can conclude that a lingual plate is indicated when there is insufficient space for a lingual bar or when there is a need to replace all posterior teeth bilaterally. Therefore, the correct answer is A. There is need for addition of one or more Anterior teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
