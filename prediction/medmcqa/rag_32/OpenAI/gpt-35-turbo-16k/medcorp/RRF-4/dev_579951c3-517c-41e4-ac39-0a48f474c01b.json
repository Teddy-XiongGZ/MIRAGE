    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the infant mortality rate, we need to divide the number of infant deaths (deaths before 1 year of age) by the number of live births and multiply by 1000. In this case, the number of infant deaths is 56 (died before 28 days of life) + 34 (died between 28 days - 1 year) = 90. The number of live births is 456. So, the infant mortality rate is (90/456) * 1000 = 197.4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
