    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Saliva production is stimulated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Sympathetic stimulation of saliva is to facilitate respiration, whereas parasympathetic stimulation is to facilitate digestion. Cholinergic drugs mimic the effects of parasympathetic stimulation and can increase saliva production. Anticholinergic drugs, on the other hand, block the effects of parasympathetic stimulation and can decrease saliva production. Adrenergic drugs, which stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, do not directly increase saliva production. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Cholinergic drugs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
