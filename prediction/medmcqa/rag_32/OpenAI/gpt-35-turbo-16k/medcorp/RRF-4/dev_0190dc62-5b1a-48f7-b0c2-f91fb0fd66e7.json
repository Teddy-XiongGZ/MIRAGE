    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antigenic drift is the gradual accumulation of mutations in the virus genes that code for virus-surface proteins, resulting in a new strain of virus that is not effectively inhibited by pre-existing antibodies. It is a process that occurs in all types of influenza, including influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Antigenic drift is not a result of frameshift mutation, but rather the accumulation of point mutations in the genes encoding the surface proteins. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Antigenic drift affects the surface proteins, specifically the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins, which are responsible for binding to host cells and viral release, respectively. It does not primarily affect the matrix protein. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Based on the information provided, none of the options are true about antigenic drift. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
