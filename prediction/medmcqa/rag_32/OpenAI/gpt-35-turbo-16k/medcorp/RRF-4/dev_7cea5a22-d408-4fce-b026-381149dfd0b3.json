    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the center of rotation during intrusion. To answer this, we need to find information about the center of rotation during intrusion in the relevant documents. After reviewing the documents, we can see that Document [5] titled 'Intrusion of the anterior teeth with the segmented-arch technic of Burstone--a clinical study' provides information about the center of rotation during intrusion. According to this document, the center of resistance must be presumed to be more distal than previously assumed. This suggests that the center of rotation during intrusion is outside the tooth. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Outside the tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
