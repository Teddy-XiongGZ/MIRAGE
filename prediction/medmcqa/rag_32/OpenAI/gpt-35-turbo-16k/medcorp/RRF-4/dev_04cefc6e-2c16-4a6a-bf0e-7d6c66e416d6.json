    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, Streptococcus mutans is considered a principal etiologic agent of caries because it produces organic acids. The documents mention that S. mutans metabolizes sugars to organic acids, particularly lactic acid, which leads to the demineralization of the tooth enamel and the initiation of dental caries. There is no mention of S. mutans forming a gelatinous matrix, metabolizing substrate from saliva, deriving energy from enamel constituents, or living symbiotically with lactobacillus. Therefore, the correct answer is that S. mutans produces organic acids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
