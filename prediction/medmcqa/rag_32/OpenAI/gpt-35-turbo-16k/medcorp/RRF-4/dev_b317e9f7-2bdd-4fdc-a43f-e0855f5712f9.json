    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the physiological active form of cholesterol. To determine the answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] mentions that active cholesterol is the fraction that exceeds the complexing capacity of the polar bilayer lipids and prompts several feedback responses. Document [5] also refers to active cholesterol as the small fraction of cholesterol molecules that circulate briskly among cell membranes and serve diverse functions. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the physiological active form of cholesterol is the fraction that exceeds the complexing capacity of polar bilayer lipids, which is referred to as active cholesterol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Free cholesterol\"}"
