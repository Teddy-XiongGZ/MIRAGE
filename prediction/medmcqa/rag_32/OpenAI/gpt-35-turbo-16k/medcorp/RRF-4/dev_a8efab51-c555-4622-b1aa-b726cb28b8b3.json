    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the answer to this question, we need to identify the document that discusses the mechanical objectives of cleaning and shaping in endodontic treatment. Document [0] discusses the essential procedures for cleaning and shaping the root canal systems, which are the establishment of apical patency and the serial enlargement of the body of the root canal by the envelope of motion of reamers. Therefore, we can conclude that the mechanical objectives of cleaning and shaping are not given by any of the provided choices (A, B, C, D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
