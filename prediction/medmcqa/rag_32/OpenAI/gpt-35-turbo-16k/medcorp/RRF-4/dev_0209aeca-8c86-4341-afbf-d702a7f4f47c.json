    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which teeth are least involved in periodontitis, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that periodontitis can be localized (less than 30% of teeth involved) or generalized (more than 30% of teeth involved). Document [1] states that chronic periodontitis is generally slow to moderate in terms of disease progression. Document [3] provides information on chronic periodontitis, while Document [5] discusses aggressive periodontitis. Based on this information, we can infer that the teeth least involved in periodontitis would be those that are less susceptible to the disease and have a lower likelihood of being affected. Considering the options provided, the teeth that are least involved in periodontitis would be the ones that are less susceptible to the disease. Therefore, the answer is C. Upper molars and upper incisors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
