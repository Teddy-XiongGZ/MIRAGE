    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the shape of the wedge for deep gingival sheath preparation, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [2] discusses the principles and applications of wedges in restorative dentistry. It states that the occlusion of the matrix band to the remaining healthy tooth structure of the gingival cavosurface line angle should be achieved solely by the correct application of the wedges. This suggests that the shape of the wedge should be able to create a proper occlusion with the tooth structure. Based on this information, we can conclude that the shape of the wedge for deep gingival sheath preparation should be triangular, as it allows for better adaptation and occlusion with the tooth structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Triangular\"}"
