    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed breathlessness, pruritus, and urticaria after taking NSAIDs, which suggests a possible allergic reaction. The presence of rales on chest examination indicates pulmonary involvement. The low blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg suggests hypotension. The initial management of an allergic reaction with hypotension includes crystalloid infusion to restore intravascular volume and improve blood pressure, steroids to reduce inflammation and allergic response, and early respiratory support and oxygenation to ensure adequate oxygen supply.
