    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the distance of the blade from the shank to have antirotational stability of the instrument, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that for hollow-ground blades, stability is augmented by a transverse stabilizer in the form of one or two narrow strips of thicker metal running from the back of the blade to the end of the shoulder (at the junction where the blade meets the shank). However, it does not specify the exact distance. Document [6] mentions that a thick strip of metal running transversely at the junction where the main blade attaches to the shank is called the stabilizer. It does not provide a specific measurement either. Document [23] discusses the potential of polymethylmethacrylate cement-augmented helical proximal femoral nail antirotation blades to improve implant stability. While it does not mention the exact distance, it suggests that cement augmentation enhances cut-out resistance in proximal femoral fractures. Based on the available information, none of the documents provide a specific measurement for the distance of the blade from the shank to have antirotational stability of the instrument. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be determined from the given documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
