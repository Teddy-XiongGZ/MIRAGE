    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient on anti-tubercular therapy is experiencing tingling sensation in the limbs, which is a symptom of peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is a known side effect of certain anti-tubercular drugs, including isoniazid (INH). To improve the symptoms, it is important to identify the specific nutrient deficiency that may be contributing to the neuropathy. Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, but it is not commonly associated with anti-tubercular therapy. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency can also cause peripheral neuropathy, and it is a known side effect of INH. Folic acid (vitamin B9) deficiency is not typically associated with peripheral neuropathy. Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, but it is not commonly associated with anti-tubercular therapy. Therefore, the most likely nutrient deficiency that may be contributing to the symptoms is pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency. Substituting pyridoxine can result in improvement of the symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
