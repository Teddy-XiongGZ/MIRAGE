    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Optic atrophy refers to the degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons, resulting in shrinkage of the optic nerve. To determine which condition optic atrophy is not seen in, we need to review the relevant documents for information about the causes of optic atrophy. Document [8] states that optic atrophy is a clinical sign indicating several conditions, rather than a disease itself. Document [7] provides a retrospective case series of non-glaucomatous optic atrophy, listing the main etiologies as space-occupying intracranial lesions, congenital/hereditary diseases, hydrocephalus, trauma, and vascular causes. Document [20] explains that optic atrophy is caused by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons. Based on this information, we can eliminate options that are known to be associated with optic atrophy. Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetic disorder that affects the retina, not the optic nerve, so it is unlikely to cause optic atrophy. Methanol poisoning can lead to optic nerve damage and subsequent optic atrophy. Central retinal arterial occlusion (CRAO) is a blockage of the central retinal artery, which can cause ischemia and damage to the optic nerve, leading to optic atrophy. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy is a condition that affects the choroidal blood vessels, not the optic nerve, so it is unlikely to cause optic atrophy. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Retinitis pigmentosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
