    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child in question presents with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and accumulation of highly branched glycogen called limit dextrins. Based on these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III), also known as Cori's disease. GSD III is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme amylo-1,6-glucosidase, or debrancher enzyme, which leads to the accumulation of abnormal glycogen called limit dextrins in the liver, muscles, and sometimes the heart. McArdle's disease (glycogen storage disease type V) is characterized by muscle cramps and exercise intolerance, not hepatomegaly. Anderson's disease (glycogen storage disease type IV) is characterized by progressive liver failure and cirrhosis, not hepatomegaly with limit dextrins. Von Gierke's disease (glycogen storage disease type I) is characterized by severe fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and lactic acidosis, but not the accumulation of limit dextrins. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Cori's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
