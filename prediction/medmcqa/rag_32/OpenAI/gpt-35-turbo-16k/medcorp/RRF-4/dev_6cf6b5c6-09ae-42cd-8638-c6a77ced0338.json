However, several documents discuss the surgical techniques used to repair telecanthus, such as transnasal wiring, canthopexy, and medial canthoplasty. None of these techniques specifically mention the use of a bicoronal, upper blepharoplasty, infraorbital, or preauricular incision. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact incision used for treatment of traumatic telecanthus based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
