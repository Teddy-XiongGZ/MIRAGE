    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the factors that affect condensation shrinkage of porcelain during firing, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that a well condensation technique can minimize shrinkage and strengthen the structure of porcelain. Document [2] mentions that the firing conditions, such as temperature, rate of temperature rise, holding time, and cooling time, influence the distribution of the sintering, glass, and crystal phases in the microstructure of the porcelain. Document [10] discusses the effects of firing temperature on the optical and mechanical properties of porcelain. Based on this information, we can conclude that the factors affecting condensation shrinkage of porcelain during firing include the firing conditions (temperature, rate of temperature rise, holding time, and cooling time) and the firing temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
