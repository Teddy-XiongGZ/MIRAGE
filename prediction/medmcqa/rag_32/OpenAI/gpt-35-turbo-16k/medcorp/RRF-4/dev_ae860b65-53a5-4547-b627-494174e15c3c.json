    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to evaluate each statement and determine if it is true or false. \\n\\nA. Before performing the ABG, syringe should be loaded with 0.3 cc of heparin - This statement is true. Heparin is commonly used to prevent clotting of the blood sample.\\n\\nB. Normal pH, HCO3, and PCO2 levels may not indicate absence of an acid-base imbalance - This statement is true. Normal values do not necessarily rule out the presence of an acid-base imbalance.\\n\\nC. A different site should be tried if modified Allen's test is negative - This statement is true. The modified Allen's test is used to assess collateral circulation in the hand before performing a radial artery puncture. If the test is negative, indicating poor collateral circulation, a different site should be tried.\\n\\nD. Radial artery is the preferred site - This statement is false. While the radial artery is commonly used for ABG sampling, it is not always the preferred site. Other sites, such as the brachial or femoral artery, may be used depending on the patient's condition or clinical situation.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, the answer is D. Radial artery is the preferred site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
