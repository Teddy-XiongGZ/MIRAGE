    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the drug commonly used for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the outpatient department (OPD), we need to review the relevant documents. Document [2] states that in the United Kingdom, amoxicillin is used as first-line therapy for CAP in the community. Document [4] mentions that the least expensive beta-lactamase stable antibiotic, such as amoxicillin, should be used as monotherapy for the empiric treatment of CAP. Document [6] suggests that the selection of antimicrobial therapy for severe CAP should be based on local monitoring of antimicrobial resistance. Based on this information, the drug commonly used for CAP in the OPD is likely amoxicillin. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Azithromycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
