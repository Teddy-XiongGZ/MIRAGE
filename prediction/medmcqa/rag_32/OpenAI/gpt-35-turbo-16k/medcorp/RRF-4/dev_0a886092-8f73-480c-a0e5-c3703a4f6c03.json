    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mesonephros is a temporary kidney that develops during embryonic life. It gives rise to various structures in the reproductive system. To determine which of the given choices is not derived from the mesonephros, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. According to the documents, the mesonephros atrophies and disappears rapidly as the permanent kidney (metanephros) begins to develop. In males, a few of the more caudal tubules of the mesonephros survive and give rise to the efferent ductules of the testis, the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, as well as vestigial structures such as the appendix testis, appendix epididymis, and paradidymis. The glomerulus, on the other hand, is a component of the nephron, which is not derived from the mesonephros. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Glomerulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
