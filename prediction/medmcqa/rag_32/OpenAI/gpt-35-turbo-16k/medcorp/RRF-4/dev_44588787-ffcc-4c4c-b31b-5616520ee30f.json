    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the causes of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that PONV can be caused by nausea, vomiting, or retching experienced by a patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) or within 24 hours following a surgical procedure. Document [1] mentions that cannabinoids have been used for treatment of PONV, but its safety and efficacy are controversial. Document [2] states that multiple factors are associated with an increased risk of developing PONV, including age, gender, pre-existing disease, premedication, operative procedure, anaesthetic and analgesic drugs, anaesthetic procedure, and postoperative symptoms. Document [4] mentions that there are multiple contributing factors that stimulate the vomiting reflex in PONV, and no single component is typically the causative factor. Document [9] states that medications to treat and prevent PONV are limited by both cost and adverse effects. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, B, and C as potential causes of PONV. Acetaminophen (option D) is not mentioned in any of the documents as a cause of PONV. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Acetaminophen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
