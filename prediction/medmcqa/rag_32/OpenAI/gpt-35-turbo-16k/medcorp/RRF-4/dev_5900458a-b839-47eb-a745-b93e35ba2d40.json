    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common cause of postauricular lymphadenopathy in children, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that occipital and postauricular adenopathy is a common nonspecific finding in infancy. Document [1] mentions Kimura's disease as a rare cause of postauricular swelling. Document [2] states that supraclavicular nodes should be regarded with a high index of suspicion of malignancy. Document [3] mentions that the most common localization of lymphadenopathy is the head and neck region. Document [8] states that acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal infection in 40% to 80% of cases. Based on this information, the most common cause of postauricular lymphadenopathy in children is likely to be a nonspecific finding or a benign infection.
