    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Haem synthesis involves the biosynthesis of haem from aminolevulinic acid (ALA) through a series of enzymatic reactions. One of the key steps in haem synthesis is the conversion of succinyl CoA to succinyl porphyrinogen, which is then further modified to form haem. Therefore, the TCA intermediate used in haem synthesis is Succinyl CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
