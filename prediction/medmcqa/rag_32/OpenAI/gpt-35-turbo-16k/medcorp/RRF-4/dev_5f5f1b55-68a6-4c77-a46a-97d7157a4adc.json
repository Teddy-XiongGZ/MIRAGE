    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the cause of medullary nephrocalcinosis in a 3-month-old infant, we need to review the relevant documents and identify the conditions that can cause this condition. We know from Document [0] that medullary nephrocalcinosis in children can be caused by hereditary tubular disorders, metabolic disorders, and iatrogenic causes. From Document [1], we learn that medullary nephrocalcinosis can be caused by idiopathic hypercalciuria, Bartter's syndrome, and renal tubular acidosis. Document [4] mentions that distal renal tubular acidosis can cause medullary nephrocalcinosis. Document [8] states that nephropathic cystinosis can lead to medullary nephrocalcinosis. However, there is no mention of ARPKD as a cause of medullary nephrocalcinosis in any of the documents. Therefore, the correct answer is D. ARPKD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
