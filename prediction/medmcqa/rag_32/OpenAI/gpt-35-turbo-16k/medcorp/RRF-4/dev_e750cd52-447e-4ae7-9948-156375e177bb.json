    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best noninvasive investigation to check for viability of myocardium, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that several noninvasive tests, including positron emission tomography (PET), thallium-201 scintigraphy, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used to differentiate viable from nonviable myocardium. Document [2] and Document [3] both mention that myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is a diagnostic tool with high sensitivity for diagnosing myocardial viability. Document [10] also mentions that speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is a noninvasive method for defining myocardial motion and can be valuable for assessing ischemia. Based on this information, the best noninvasive investigation to check for viability of myocardium is likely C. Echocardiogram, as it is mentioned in multiple documents and specifically highlighted as a diagnostic tool for assessing myocardial viability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
