    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the smallest cusp in the mandibular first molar, we need to refer to the relevant documents that provide information about the cusps of this tooth. Document [6] states that there are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal, two lingual, and one distal. Document [9] also confirms that the mandibular first molar has five cusps: the mesiobuccal (MB), mesiolingual (ML), distolingual (DL), distobuccal (DB), and distal (D) cusps. However, it does not specify which cusp is the smallest. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively determine the smallest cusp in the mandibular first molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
