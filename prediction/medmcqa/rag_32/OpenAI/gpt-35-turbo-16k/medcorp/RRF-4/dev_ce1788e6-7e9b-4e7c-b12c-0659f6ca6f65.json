    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which technique should be the last resort for giving local anesthesia (L.A.) to the patient, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. None of the documents specifically mention the last resort technique for L.A. However, Document [0] discusses the use of local anesthesia in surgery, Document [1] mentions different techniques for abdominal thrusts, Document [5] discusses minimally invasive therapy, Document [12] discusses arterialization of the venous system for hand ischemia, Document [28] discusses spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain, and Document [30] discusses seeking a second opinion in orthopaedic surgery. None of these documents provide direct information about the last resort technique for L.A. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine the last resort technique for giving L.A. to the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
