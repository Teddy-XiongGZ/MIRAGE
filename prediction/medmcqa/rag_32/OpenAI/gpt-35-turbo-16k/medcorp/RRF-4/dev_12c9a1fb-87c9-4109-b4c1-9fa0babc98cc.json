    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ductus dependent blood flow refers to the reliance on the ductus arteriosus for blood flow in certain cardiac defects. To determine which cardiac defects are characterized by ductus dependent blood flow, we need to identify the defects that require the ductus arteriosus to remain open for adequate circulation. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Transposition of great arteries with intact septum: In this condition, the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, resulting in parallel circulation. The ductus arteriosus is necessary to allow mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, making this defect ductus dependent.\\n\\nB. Interrupted aortic arch: This defect involves a complete interruption of the aortic arch, resulting in two separate circulations. The ductus arteriosus is necessary to provide blood flow to the lower body, making this defect ductus dependent.\\n\\nC. Truncus arteriosus: In this defect, there is a single arterial trunk arising from both ventricles, resulting in mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The ductus arteriosus is necessary to provide blood flow to the pulmonary arteries, making this defect ductus dependent.\\n\\nD. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: This defect involves underdevelopment of the left side of the heart, including the left ventricle. The ductus arteriosus is not necessary for blood flow in this defect, as the right ventricle pumps blood to both the systemic and pulmonary circulations.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, as it is not characterized by ductus dependent blood flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
