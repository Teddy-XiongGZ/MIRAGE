    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which factor can increase birth weight, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. Document [0] states that birth weight is influenced by factors such as maternal health, pre-existing diseases, medications, and multiple births. Document [4] mentions that gestational weight gain between 12 and 20 kg can result in a greater number of newborns with birth weights between 3000 and 3499g. Document [9] also supports the idea that maternal weight gain is an important predictor of infant birth weight. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the factor that can increase birth weight is gestational weight gain. Therefore, the answer is not A. Cessation of smoking, B. Aspirin, or D.
