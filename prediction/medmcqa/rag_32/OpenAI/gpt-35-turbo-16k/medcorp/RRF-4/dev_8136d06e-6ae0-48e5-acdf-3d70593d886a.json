    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ANB angle is used to determine the sagittal jaw relationship in malocclusion. According to the documents, the average ANB angle for a class I skeletal pattern is 2 degrees. An ANB angle greater than 4 degrees indicates a class II skeletal pattern and an angle less than 2 degrees indicates a class III skeletal pattern. Therefore, in class II malocclusion, the ANB angle is greater than normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
