    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the rotation speed of profile instruments, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that the rotary system used to test the fatigue of ProFile instruments is rotated at 350 rpm speed. Document [7] states that the NiTi rotary files operated at different speeds, including 350 rpm. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that the rotation speed of profile instruments is 350 rpm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 100-3000 RPM\"}"
