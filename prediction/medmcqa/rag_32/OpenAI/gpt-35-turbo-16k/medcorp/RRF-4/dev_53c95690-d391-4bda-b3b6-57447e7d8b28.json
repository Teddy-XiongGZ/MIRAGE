    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the radiographic features of sinusitis. Document [1] states that air-fluid levels and complete opacification of a sinus are more specific for sinusitis, but they are only seen in 60 percent of cases. Document [6] mentions that radiographic findings of chronic sinusitis can include mucosal thickening, opacification, and air-fluid levels. Document [12] states that air-fluid levels and opacification can be seen on sinus CT imaging. Based on this information, the radiographic feature of sinusitis can include fluid levels, erosion of bone, and clouding of antra. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Clouding and fluid level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
