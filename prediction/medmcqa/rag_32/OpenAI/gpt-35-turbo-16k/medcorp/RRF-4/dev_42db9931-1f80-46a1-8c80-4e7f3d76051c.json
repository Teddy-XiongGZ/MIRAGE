    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the clinical significance of the inferior thyroid artery and its relationship to various structures during thyroid surgery. Document [1] states that the superior thyroid artery must be ligated during thyroidectomy to control bleeding. Document [4] mentions that accidental ligation of the inferior thyroid artery during thyroidectomy can cause hypoparathyroidism. Document [8] presents a randomized study comparing truncal ligation versus distal ligation of the inferior thyroid artery during total thyroidectomy, but it does not specify the reason for the ligation. Document [15] states that during thyroidectomy, careful attention should be given to the arteries of the thyroid as well as coursing nerves, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the ligation of the inferior thyroid artery during thyroidectomy is done to protect the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
