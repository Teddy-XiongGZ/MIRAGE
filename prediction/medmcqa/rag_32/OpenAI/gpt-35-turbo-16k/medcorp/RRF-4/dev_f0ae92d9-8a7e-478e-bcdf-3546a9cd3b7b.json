    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lacrimation is the production of tears, and it is regulated by the lacrimal gland. The lacrimal gland receives innervation from both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The parasympathetic innervation is provided by the lacrimal nerve, which is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Therefore, the damage to the trigeminal nerve can affect lacrimation. The other nerves mentioned in the options (nasociliary nerve, greater petrosal nerve, and anterior ethmoid nerve) do not directly innervate the lacrimal gland and are not primarily involved in lacrimation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Trigeminal nerve\"}"
