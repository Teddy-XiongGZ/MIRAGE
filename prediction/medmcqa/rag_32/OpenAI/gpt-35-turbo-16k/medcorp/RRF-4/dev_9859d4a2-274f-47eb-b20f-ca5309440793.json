    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus which is not mediated through a toxin, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that S. aureus usually acts as a commensal bacterium but can cause various skin and soft-tissue infections, particularly when skin or mucosal barriers have been breached. Document [7] mentions that once inside the body, the bacteria may spread to various body systems and organs, including the heart, where toxins produced by the bacteria may cause cardiac arrest. Document [27] states that deeply penetrating S. aureus infections can be severe and manifest in various ways, including small benign boils, folliculitis, impetigo, cellulitis, and more severe, invasive soft-tissue infections. Based on this information, we can conclude that the disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus which is not mediated through a toxin is septicemic shock.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
