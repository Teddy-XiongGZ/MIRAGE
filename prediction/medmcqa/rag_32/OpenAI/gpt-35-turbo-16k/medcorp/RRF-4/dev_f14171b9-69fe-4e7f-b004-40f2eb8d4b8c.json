    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options is not a G2 phase blocker, we need to refer to the relevant documents and find information about the drugs mentioned. Document [3] states that G2/M blockers are very potent at inducing apoptosis, while G1/S blockers are ineffective. Document [10] mentions that camptothecin and etoposide are topoisomerase poisons active in S and early G2 phase. Document [15] discusses the complex dynamics of G1, S, and G2-M checkpoint activities. Based on this information, we can conclude that etoposide is a G2 phase blocker. Therefore, the answer is C. Paclitaxel, as it is not mentioned in any of the relevant documents as a G2 phase blocker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
