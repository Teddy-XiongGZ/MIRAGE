    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the approximate volume of filler, we need to consider the weight fraction of filler and the density of the filler material. However, the density of the filler material is not provided in the documents. Therefore, we cannot accurately calculate the volume of filler based on the weight fraction alone. We cannot determine the answer to the question based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"N/A\"}"
