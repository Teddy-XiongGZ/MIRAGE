    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, materials that have high compressive strength and low tensile strength are classified with the property of brittleness. Brittleness refers to the ability of a material to break or shatter without significant deformation when under stress. Materials with high compressive strength and low tensile strength, such as concrete and ceramics, are prone to brittle failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
