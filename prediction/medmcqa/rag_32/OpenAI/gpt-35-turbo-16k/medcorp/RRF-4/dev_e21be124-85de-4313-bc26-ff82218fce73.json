    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which pulp horn of primary molars is commonly exposed during restorative procedures, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [5] discusses the involvement of the pulp in primary molars following a proximal caries attack. It states that most primary molars with proximal caries manifest pulp inflammation involving the entire pulp horn, but rarely the root canal tissue. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the pulp horn commonly exposed during restorative procedures is the mesiobuccal pulp horn, as it is the one most affected by proximal caries. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Mesiobuccal pulp horn of 1st molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
