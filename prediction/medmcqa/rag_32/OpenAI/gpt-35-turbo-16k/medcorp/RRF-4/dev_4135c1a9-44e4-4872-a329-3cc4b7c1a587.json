    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is common to both zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [26] states that zinc polycarboxylate cements adhere to enamel and dentin by means of chelation reaction. Document [27] mentions that the reactivity of zinc oxide with eugenol increases with the amount of water reversibly adsorbed. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is C. Chelation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
