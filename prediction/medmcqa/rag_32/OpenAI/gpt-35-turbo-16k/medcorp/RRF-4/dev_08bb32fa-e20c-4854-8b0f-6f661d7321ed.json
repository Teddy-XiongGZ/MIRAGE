    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine what should be done for better cast in case of addition silicones, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that the use of a retarder with a light-bodied addition silicone can increase the working time but may result in poorly fitting crowns. Document [6] states that silicone impression material has better dimensional stability than polyether, but impressions made from polyether should be poured only once and within 24 hours after impression making. Document [18] indicates that addition-cured silicone materials exhibit excellent dimensional stability for all storage times, and delayed pouring of artificial stone in these impressions should result in very little change in die accuracy. Based on this information, it can be concluded that for better cast in case of addition silicones, the pouring of the cast should be delayed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
