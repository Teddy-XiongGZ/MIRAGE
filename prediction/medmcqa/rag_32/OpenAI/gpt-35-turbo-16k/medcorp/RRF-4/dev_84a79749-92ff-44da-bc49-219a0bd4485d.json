    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Bacteriocins are proteinaceous or peptidic toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strains. They are similar to yeast and paramecium killing factors, and are structurally, functionally, and ecologically diverse. Based on this information, we can conclude that bacteriocins are proteins (Choice C). However, there is no mention of bacteriocins having a role in adherence of plaque to the tooth surface (Choice A) or enhancing the growth of other bacteria (Choice D). The use of bacteriocins in therapy of dental caries is mentioned as a possible application of bacteriocins (Choice B). Therefore, the correct answer is A. It has no role in adherence of plaque to the tooth surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
