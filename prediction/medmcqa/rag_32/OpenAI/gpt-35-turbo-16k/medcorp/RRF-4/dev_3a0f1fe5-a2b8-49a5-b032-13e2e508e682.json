    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a normal blood glucose level as estimated by the glucose-oxidase peroxidase method. Benedicts test is used to detect reducing sugars, including glucose, in urine. A positive Benedicts test indicates the presence of glucose in the urine. Therefore, the most likely cause of the positive Benedicts test in this patient is the presence of glucose in the urine, which is not a false positive. The other options, fructosemia, denaturation of glucose, and galactosemia, are not relevant in this case as they do not explain the presence of glucose in the urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. False positive\"}"
