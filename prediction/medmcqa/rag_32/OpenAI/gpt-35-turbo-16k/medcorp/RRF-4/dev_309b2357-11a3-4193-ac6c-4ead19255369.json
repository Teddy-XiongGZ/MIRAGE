    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, migration of odontoblasts into dentinal tubules occurs during dentinogenesis, which is the process of dentin formation. This process involves the differentiation of odontoblasts from cells of the dental papilla and the secretion of an organic matrix called predentin. As the predentin thickens, the odontoblasts move or are displaced centrally, and their cytoplasmic extensions, known as odontoblast processes, penetrate into the dentinal tubules. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
