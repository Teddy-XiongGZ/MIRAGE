    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which option is not contraindicated in centrineuraxial (spinal and epidural) anesthesia, we need to review the contraindications mentioned in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that contraindications to spinal anesthesia include bleeding disorders, thrombocytopenia, or systemic anticoagulation. Document [4] explains that epidural anesthesia can cause bleeding problems. Document [13] mentions that the risk of epidural hematoma, a severe complication, is higher in patients with coagulation disorders. Based on this information, we can conclude that the contraindication for centrineuraxial anesthesia is patients with bleeding disorders, thrombocytopenia, or systemic anticoagulation. Therefore, the correct answer is not contraindicated in patients on oral anticoagulants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
