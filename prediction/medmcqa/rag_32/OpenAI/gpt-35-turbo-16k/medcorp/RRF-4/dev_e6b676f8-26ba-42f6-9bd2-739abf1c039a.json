    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the connections found in the odontoblastic layer, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [29] states that three kinds of intercellular junctions were detected between human odontoblast cell bodies: gap junctions, desmosomes, and tight junctions. Gap junctions allow intercellular communication, desmosomes are sites of cell-to-cell adhesion, and tight junctions contribute to the pseudo-epithelial organization of the odontoblastic layer. Therefore, the connections found in the odontoblastic layer are gap junctions, desmosomes, and tight junctions. The correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
