    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the 8-year-old child fractured his maxillary central incisor 10 months ago and the pulp shows no response. There is no periapical lesion in the radiograph. In this case, the treatment of choice would be Ca(OH)2 pulp capping. Pulp capping is a conservative treatment option for immature permanent teeth with incomplete root development and a non-vital pulp. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is commonly used as a pulp capping material to promote dentin bridge formation and apexogenesis. It stimulates the pulp to form a hard tissue barrier, allowing for continued root development. This treatment option is preferred when there is no evidence of periapical pathology and the tooth is asymptomatic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
