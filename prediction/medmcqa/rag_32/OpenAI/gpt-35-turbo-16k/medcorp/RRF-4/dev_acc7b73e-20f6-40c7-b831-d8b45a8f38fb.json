    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the poor prognostic indicator of ALL, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss prognostic factors in ALL. Document [23] specifically mentions prognostic factors in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which is not the same as ALL. Therefore, we need to refer to other documents that discuss prognostic factors in ALL. After reviewing the relevant documents, we find that Document [28] mentions the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and its age-adjusted variant as prognostic indicators for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, this does not provide information specifically about ALL. Therefore, we cannot determine the poor prognostic indicator of ALL based on the provided documents. We need additional information or sources specifically discussing prognostic factors in ALL.\"}"
