    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 4-year-old girl who presents with severe vomiting after a viral fever. She develops cerebral edema. To determine the likely finding on liver biopsy, we need to consider the possible causes of cerebral edema in this context. One possibility is Reye's syndrome, which is characterized by encephalopathy and fatty change of the liver. Another possibility is acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), which is associated with viral infections. Given the patient's presentation and the association with a viral fever, ANE is a more likely diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely finding on liver biopsy would be marked microvesicular steatosis, which is characteristic of ANE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
