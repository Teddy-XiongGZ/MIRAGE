    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most effective, scientifically proven, and cost-efficient caries prevention program in children, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions a preventive program based on caries risk assessment that was introduced for 3- to 19-year-olds in the County of V\u00e4rmland, Sweden. This program resulted in a significant decrease in caries prevalence and incidence. Document [2] suggests that frequent fluoride applications in conjunction with effective plaque removal can be successful in preventing caries in high-risk groups. Document [15] highlights the use of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for caries prevention, which has proven efficacy in preventing new caries lesions. Document [20] discusses the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive school-based caries prevention program that includes the use of sealants. Based on this information, the most effective, scientifically proven, and cost-efficient caries prevention program in children is likely to be pit and fissure sealants (Choice C). These sealants can effectively protect the occlusal surfaces of the first permanent molars, which are commonly affected by caries. They have been shown to be cost-effective and can be part of a comprehensive preventive program that includes fluoride applications and plaque removal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
