    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the feature that distinguishes herpes zoster from other vesiculo butlous eruptions, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that herpes zoster classically presents as a vesicular eruption along a single dermatome. This suggests that the correct answer is likely related to the distribution of the eruption. We can further confirm this by looking at other documents that discuss the clinical presentation of herpes zoster. Document [12] mentions that zoster lesions appear in a dermatomal distribution, while document [17] states that lesions are distributed unilaterally within a single dermatome. Based on this information, the correct answer is likely A. Unilateral occurrence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
