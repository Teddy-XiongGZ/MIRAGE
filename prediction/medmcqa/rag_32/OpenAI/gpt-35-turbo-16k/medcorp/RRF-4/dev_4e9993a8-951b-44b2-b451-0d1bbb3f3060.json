    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the location of tooth brush abrasions, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that dental abrasion tends to present as rounded ditching around the cervical margins of teeth, commonly described as 'shallow', concave or wedge-shaped notches. Document [8] mentions that abrasion frequently presents at the cemento-enamel junction and can be caused by many contributing factors, all with the ability to affect the tooth surface in varying degrees. Based on this information, tooth brush abrasions can occur on any teeth, but they are most commonly found at the cervical margins of teeth. Therefore, the answer is not specific to a particular half of the arch or a particular set of teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information to determine\"}"
