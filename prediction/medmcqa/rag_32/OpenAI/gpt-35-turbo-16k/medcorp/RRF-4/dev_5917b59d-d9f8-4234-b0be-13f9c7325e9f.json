    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death characterized by distinct morphological and biochemical features. It involves cellular shrinking, condensation and margination of the chromatin, ruffling of the plasma membrane, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis is not associated with liquefaction degeneration or coagulative necrosis, which are forms of cell death with different morphological characteristics. Neo angiogenesis refers to the formation of new blood vessels and is not directly related to apoptosis. Epithelial dysplasia refers to abnormal growth and differentiation of epithelial cells and is not specific to apoptosis. Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
