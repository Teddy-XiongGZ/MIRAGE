    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, fibers reaching directly to Purkinje cells of the cerebellum arise from the inferior olivary nucleus. Document [1] states that climbing fibers, which originate from the inferior olive, wind around the dendrites of Purkinje cells and make a large number of synapses. This input is so strong that a single action potential from a climbing fiber is capable of producing a complex spike in the Purkinje cell. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Inferior olivary nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
