    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which amino acid does not include post-translational modification, we need to find information about post-translational modifications of each amino acid in the provided documents. From the documents, we can see that hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are both examples of amino acids that undergo post-translational modification. Document [0] mentions that hydroxyproline is generated by hydroxylation of proline, and Document [4] states that hydroxyproline is formed by post-translational modification. Document [4] also mentions that hypusine, which is formed by modification of a lysine residue, is an example of post-translational modification. Therefore, hydroxylysine is also an amino acid that undergoes post-translational modification. Document [7] states that selenocysteine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that can be incorporated into proteins by special translation mechanisms, which suggests that it does undergo post-translational modification. Triiodothyronine is not mentioned in any of the documents in relation to post-translational modification. Therefore, the amino acid that does not include post-translational modification is B. Triiodothyronine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
