    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the histological findings suggest that the epithelium of the graft undergoes changes. In Document [0], it is mentioned that in the transitional zone between the graft and gingiva, the gingival epithelium showed a layer of parakeratinization, as opposed to the dense layer of orthokeratin found on the grafted palatal epithelium. In Document [2], it is stated that the de-epithelialized gingival graft (DGG) is obtained with a superficial harvesting technique that leaves the deep portion of the submucosa and the periosteum excluded from the graft. Additionally, Document [5] mentions that the surface epithelium of free gingival grafts degenerates and re-epithelizes by cells proliferating from adjacent tissues. Therefore, the epithelium of the graft undergoes degeneration and re-epithelialization by proliferating cells from adjacent tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Proliferates\"}"
