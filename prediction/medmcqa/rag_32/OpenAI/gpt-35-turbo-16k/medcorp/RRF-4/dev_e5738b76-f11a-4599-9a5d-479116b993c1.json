    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels, resulting from the relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls. It can be caused by various factors, including endogenous substances and drugs. To determine the specific cause of vasodilation, we need to examine the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that endogenous substances and drugs that cause vasodilation are termed vasodilators. Document [1] explains that flow-dependent vasodilation is closely related to the modulating properties of the vascular endothelium, and the liberation of one or more relaxing factors from endothelial cells sensitive to variations in shear stress. Document [3] states that certain vasodilatory agents work via the endothelium, enhancing the production of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator. Document [17] mentions that nitrates increase the amount of NO in vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation. Based on this information, the correct answer is not provided in the options. The correct answer is nitric oxide (NO), which is not listed as a choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
