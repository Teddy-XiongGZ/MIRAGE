    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in Document [2], GIC chemically (ionic) bonds to the tooth structure (enamel and dentin). The mechanism of GIC adhesion to the tooth's inorganic structure involves a chelation reaction between the carboxyl groups of the polyacrylic acid and the calcium in the hydroxyapatite crystals of the tooth. Therefore, the bond found in GIC is an ionic bond.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ionic bond\"}"
