    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the male partner has a low semen volume (0.8 ml per ejaculate) and absent fructose, with no sperm seen under the microscope. This suggests a possible ejaculatory duct obstruction or congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. To further evaluate this, the next step would be to perform a per-rectal examination to check for ejaculatory duct obstruction. This can help determine if there is a physical blockage preventing the release of semen. Testicular biopsy and transrectal ultrasound may be considered in certain cases, but they are not the next line of management in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
