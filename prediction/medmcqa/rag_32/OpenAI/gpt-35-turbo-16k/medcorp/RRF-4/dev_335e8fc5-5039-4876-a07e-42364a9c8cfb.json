    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen synthesis and breakdown are tightly regulated processes in hepatocytes. The enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is responsible for converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, is not present in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes where glycogenesis occurs. Instead, glucose-6-phosphatase is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes. Therefore, the freshly synthesized glucose-6-phosphate during glycogenesis in the cytoplasm cannot be immediately degraded by glucose-6-phosphatase because the enzyme is not present in the same cellular compartment. This is the reason why glucose-6-phosphate is not immediately degraded by glucose-6-phosphatase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
