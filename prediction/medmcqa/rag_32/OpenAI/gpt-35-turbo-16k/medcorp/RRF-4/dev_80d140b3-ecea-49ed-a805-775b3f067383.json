    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best fixation method in the neutral posterior zone for BSSO setback, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] discusses the role of plate fixation in minimizing condylar torquing or rotational changes in the axial plane. Document [4] compares the stability of condylar long axis after BSSO with poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) plate fixation and titanium plate fixation. Document [10] compares the stability of bicortical screw fixation and plate fixation after mandibular setback with BSSO. Document [13] compares the stability of positioning screws and plate fixation after mandibular setback with BSSO. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that the best fixation method in the neutral posterior zone for BSSO setback is miniplate fixation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
