    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To confirm the diagnosis of rabies, the most accurate test to perform on the corneal impression is histopathological examination for Negri bodies. Negri bodies are eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions found in the neurons of the central nervous system of animals infected with rabies virus. They are considered pathognomonic for rabies infection. Indirect immunofluorescence can also be used to detect the presence of rabies virus antigen, but histopathological examination for Negri bodies is more specific. PCR for virus and antibodies against Rabies virus can be used for diagnosis, but they are not the most accurate tests on the corneal impression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
