    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn presents with congestive heart failure and a bulging anterior fontanelle with a bruit on auscultation. Transfontanellar USG shows a hypoechoic midline mass with dilated lateral ventricles. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a Vein of Galen malformation (VGAM). VGAM is a rare cerebral arteriovenous malformation that can present in the neonatal period with high-output cardiac failure. It is characterized by a midline mass in the brain with dilated ventricles. Medulloblastoma is a type of brain tumor that typically presents with symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure, but it does not cause a bruit on auscultation or dilated ventricles. Encephalocele is a protrusion of brain tissue through a defect in the skull, but it does not typically present with congestive heart failure or a bruit on auscultation. Arachnoid cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can occur in the brain, but they do not typically present with congestive heart failure or a bruit on auscultation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
