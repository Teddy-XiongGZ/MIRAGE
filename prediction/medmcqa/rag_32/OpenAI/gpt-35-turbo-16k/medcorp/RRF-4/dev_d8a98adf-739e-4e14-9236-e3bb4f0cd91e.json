    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which dye is used for dentinal caries detection, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that commercially available caries-detector dyes are non-specific protein dyes that stain the organic matrix of less mineralized dentin. Document [2] mentions that caries detector dyes stain the collagen associated with less mineralized dentin. Document [3] and Document [5] both mention the use of Caries Check and Caries Detector dyes, which contain acid red. Therefore, the dye used for dentinal caries detection is the Acid red system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
