    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information can be found in Document [4] (Title: Projectional radiography). According to the document, the source-detector distance (SDD) is a measurement of the distance between the generator and the detector. The equation SOD + ODD = SDD relates the source-object distance (SOD) and the object-detector distance (ODD) to the source-detector distance. Therefore, the distance between the subject and the source of X-ray can vary depending on the specific setup and technique used. None of the provided options match the information given in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
