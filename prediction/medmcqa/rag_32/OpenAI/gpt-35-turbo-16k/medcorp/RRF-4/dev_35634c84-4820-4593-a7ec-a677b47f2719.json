    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sclerotic dentin is a type of dentin that is pathologically altered and often results in partial or complete obliteration of the dentinal tubules. It is characterized by the deposition of mineral substances, leading to increased mineralization and decreased permeability. Based on the provided documents, there is no specific information suggesting that sclerotic dentin is caries susceptible or hypersensitive.
