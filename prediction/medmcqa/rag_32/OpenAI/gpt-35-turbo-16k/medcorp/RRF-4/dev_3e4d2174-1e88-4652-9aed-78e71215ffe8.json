    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the treatment for vitamin D toxicity, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the clinical management of vitamin D toxicity is mainly supportive and focuses on lowering calcium levels. Document [14] mentions that the patient's medication list should be reviewed to adjust the future doses of vitamin D supplements. Document [22] suggests that patients may need hemodialysis due to renal failure or correct refractory hypercalcemia. Based on this information, the treatment for vitamin D toxicity involves supportive care, adjusting vitamin D supplementation, and potentially hemodialysis in severe cases. None of the options A, B, C, or D are mentioned as the specific treatment for vitamin D toxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
