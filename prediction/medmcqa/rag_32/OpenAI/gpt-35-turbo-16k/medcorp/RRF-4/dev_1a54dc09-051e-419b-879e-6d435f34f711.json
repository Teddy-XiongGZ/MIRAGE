    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is considered a high-risk infant, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [6] mentions that there are various high-risk factors in the prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal period that may result in adverse neurological outcomes. Document [15] provides guidelines for the hospital discharge of high-risk neonates, categorizing them into four groups: preterm infants, infants requiring technological support, infants primarily at risk due to family issues, and infants with irreversible conditions resulting in early death. Document [22] states that a large number of infants are born each year with biologic or environmental risk factors that put them at increased risk for developmental disability. Based on this information, we can conclude that antenatal preeclampsia (B) is considered a high-risk factor for infants. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Antenatal preeclampsia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
