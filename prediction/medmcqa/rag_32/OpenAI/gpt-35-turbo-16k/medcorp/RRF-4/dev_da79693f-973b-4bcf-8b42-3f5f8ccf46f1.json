    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the maximum chances of injury in a child patient, we need to analyze the relevant documents for information on the age group most susceptible to injuries. Document [1] provides information on the age groups of children studied in a retrospective study on unintentional pediatric trauma. According to this document, the patients were categorized into four age groups: <1 year, 1-5 years, 6-10 years, and 11-15 years. However, there is no specific mention of the maximum chances of injury in any of these age groups. Therefore, we need to analyze other documents for more information. Document [2] provides information on the common types of unintentional injuries among children admitted to a tertiary care hospital. It mentions that a higher proportion of unintentional injuries were noted to occur among children of younger mothers, overactive child, children belonging to extended or joint families, child left alone or with friends, pre-school children, male child, and from urban dwellings. However, it does not specify the exact age group with the maximum chances of injury. Document [26] provides information on the epidemiological parameters that influence the causation of trauma in the pediatric age group. It mentions that overall trauma was most common in the school-going age group (6-12 years), with male children outnumbering females. However, it does not provide specific information on the maximum chances of injury in a particular age group. Based on the available information, we cannot determine the maximum chances of injury in a child patient from the provided documents. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be determined.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
