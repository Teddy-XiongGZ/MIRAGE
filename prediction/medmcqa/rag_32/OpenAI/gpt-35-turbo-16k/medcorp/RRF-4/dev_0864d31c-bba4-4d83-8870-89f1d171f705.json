    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary survey is the initial assessment of a trauma patient to identify and treat life-threatening injuries. Imaging plays a role in the primary survey to aid in the diagnosis of these injuries. Let's evaluate each statement:\\n\\nA. Cervical X-ray is not mandatory: This statement is true. While a cervical X-ray may be performed as part of the primary survey in some cases, it is not mandatory and the decision to perform one depends on the clinical presentation and mechanism of injury.\\n\\nB. Chest X-ray and pelvic X-ray are taken as part of the primary survey: This statement is true. Chest X-ray and pelvic X-ray are commonly performed as part of the primary survey to evaluate for potential life-threatening injuries in these regions.\\n\\nC. Hemodynamically unstable patients should not be sent for CT scan: This statement is false. Hemodynamically unstable patients may still undergo a CT scan if it is deemed necessary for the evaluation and management of their injuries. The decision to perform a CT scan in these patients should be made based on the clinical judgment of the healthcare team.\\n\\nD. All patients should have chest X-ray-PA view only: This statement is false. While a chest X-ray is commonly performed as part of the primary survey, the specific view (PA or AP) may vary depending on the clinical situation and institutional protocols. Other views, such as lateral or oblique views, may also be obtained if necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
