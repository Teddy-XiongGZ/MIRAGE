    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can infer that in spherical alloys as compared to lathe cut, less condensing force is required. Document [2] states that early microleakage from alloys of lathe-cut particles was lower than that from alloys of spherical particles in both low-copper and high-copper amalgam restorations. This suggests that lathe-cut particles have better condensing properties compared to spherical particles. Therefore, the answer is A. Less condensing force is required.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
