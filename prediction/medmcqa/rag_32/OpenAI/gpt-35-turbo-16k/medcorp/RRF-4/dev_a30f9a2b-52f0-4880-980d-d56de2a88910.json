    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which property of dopamine is not helpful in acute shock, we need to review the relevant documents and find information about the effects of dopamine in shock. Document [0] states that dopamine administration was associated with increased mortality rates in shock. Document [1] mentions that dopamine has potential deleterious effects on local circulations, respiratory function, gastroduodenal motility, endocrine function, and immunity. Document [6] states that dopamine use was associated with more arrhythmic events compared to norepinephrine. Based on this information, we can conclude that the property of dopamine causing direct action on heart beta-1 receptors (choice D) is not helpful in acute shock, as it can lead to arrhythmic events and increased mortality rates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
