    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Penicillin allergy is an immune-mediated reaction. To determine the role of penicillin in the allergic reaction, we need to consider its mechanism of action. Penicillin acts as a hapten, which is a small molecule that can bind to larger proteins and trigger an immune response. In the case of penicillin allergy, penicillin acts as a hapten by binding to proteins in the body, forming a penicillin-protein complex. This complex can then be recognized by the immune system, leading to the production of antibodies and the activation of immune cells, resulting in an allergic reaction. Therefore, the answer is A. Hapten.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
