    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the characteristic features of high copper amalgam alloy. The documents mention that high copper amalgams have high color stability, corrosion resistance, and rapidly hardening and strong properties. They also show improved clinical performance with less marginal breakdown, low creep, and the presence of zinc. Therefore, the characteristic features of high copper amalgam alloy are less marginal breakdown and low creep.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Less marginal #, D. High creep\"}"
