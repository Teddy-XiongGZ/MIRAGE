    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a smoker with recent onset breathlessness. The ECG was done to help with the diagnosis. To determine the correct diagnosis, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. Document [0] describes a case of a 24-year-old male smoker with early onset COPD. Document [2] mentions that non-obstructed smokers can have exercise limitations and abnormalities in computed tomography studies. Document [3] states that pulmonary function tests (PFTs) should be performed early in smokers to detect abnormalities. Document [6] discusses a case of a massive pulmonary embolism with ST elevation on ECG. Document [14] describes a case of a 44-year-old woman with chest pain and a type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG. Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis for the smoker with recent onset breathlessness and ECG findings is acute myocardial infarction (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
