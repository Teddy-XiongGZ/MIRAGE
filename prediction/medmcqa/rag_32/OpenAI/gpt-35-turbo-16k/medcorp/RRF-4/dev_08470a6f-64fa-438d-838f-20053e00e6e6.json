    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions the prevalence, size, shape, location, and number of accessory canals in primary molars, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern. Document [1] discusses the treatment of a mandibular first molar with five root canals, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [2] provides information about the root and canal anatomy of mandibular molars, including the presence of abnormalities, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [3] discusses the apical anatomy of C-shaped canal systems in mandibular second molars, but it does not provide information about accessory canals in mandibular first molars. Document [4] mentions the prevalence of four root canals in mandibular first molars, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [5] discusses the incidence of middle mesial canals in mandibular molars, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [6] evaluates the root canal configuration of mandibular molars using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [7] presents clinical reports of mandibular molars with three canals in the mesial root, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [8] investigates the frequency of middle mesial canals in mandibular molars, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [9] examines the symmetry of root and root canal morphology in maxillary and mandibular molars, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [10] reports the presence of three-rooted mandibular first primary molars, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [11] presents a case report of a mandibular first molar with a middle distal canal, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [12] investigates the root and canal morphology of mandibular molars in a Sri Lankan population, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [13] attempts to show variations in the root canal morphology of mandibular first molars, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [14] uses CBCT to evaluate the root and canal morphology of mandibular molars in Turkish individuals, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [15] examines the prevalence of accessory canals in the furcation area of third molars, which is not specific to mandibular first molars. Document [16] investigates the root canal morphology of mandibular first molars in an Iranian population, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [17] presents a case report of a mandibular first molar with a middle mesial canal, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [18] studies the anatomical relationship of the mandibular canal to its surrounding structures, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [19] discusses the endodontic management of middle mesial canals in mandibular molars, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [20] reports a case of a mandibular molar with five canals, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [21] presents a case report of a mandibular first molar with seven canals, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [22] discusses the occurrence of accessory mandibular canals, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [23] presents case reports of mandibular first molars with three mesial canals, but it does not provide information about the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [24] evaluates the internal morphology of distal roots of mandibular first molars, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [25] investigates the prevalence and location of accessory canals in primary molars, which is not specific to mandibular first molars. Document [26] evaluates the root canal configuration of maxillary and mandibular first molars using CBCT, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [27] classifies the anatomic variation of the mandibular canal, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [28] investigates the root and canal morphology of mandibular first molars in the East Coast Malaysian population, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [29] assesses the internal morphology and root canal configuration of non C-shaped mandibular second molars, which is not specific to mandibular first molars. Document [30] reports cases of mandibular molars with five canals, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Document [31] investigates the root canal morphology of mandibular first molars using micro-computed tomography, but it does not specifically mention the major pattern of accessory canals. Based on the analysis of the relevant documents, there is no specific mention of the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular first molars. Therefore, the answer choice is D. Pattern is variable and age dependent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
