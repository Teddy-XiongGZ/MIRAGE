    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child presented with delayed motor development, mental retardation, and finger biting, which are suggestive of a neurodevelopmental disorder. The subsequent development of cerebral palsy and renal failure further supports a progressive metabolic disorder. Among the given options, the most likely enzyme deficiency implicated in this case is HGP deficiency (Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency), which is associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by delayed motor development, mental retardation, self-injurious behaviors (such as finger biting), and can progress to cerebral palsy and renal failure. Therefore, the answer is C. HGP deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
