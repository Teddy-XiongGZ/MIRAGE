    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anaesthetic agent causes adrenal suppression, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that a subanaesthetic dose of etomidate is able to block adrenal 11 hydroxylase, which suggests adrenal suppression. Document [3] also mentions that etomidate suppresses corticosteroid synthesis in the adrenal cortex. On the other hand, there is no mention of adrenal suppression caused by midazolam, thiopentone, or propofol in any of the documents. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Etomidate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
