    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the position of a misplaced implant in a patient with an implanted cardiac pacemaker (defibrillator), the most useful investigation would be an X-ray. X-rays are commonly used to evaluate the placement and position of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) during follow-up and can help identify any malposition or displacement of the leads or electrodes. CT scan, MRI, and USG may have limited utility in visualizing the position of the implant and are not typically used for this purpose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
