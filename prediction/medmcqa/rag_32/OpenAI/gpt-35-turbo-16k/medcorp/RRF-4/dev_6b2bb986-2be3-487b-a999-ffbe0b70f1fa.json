    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, it is mentioned that the impedance type apex locators are the third generation of electronic apex locators. They use two alternating frequencies and calculate the impedance between them to provide reliable and accurate results. Therefore, the split impedance based apex locator would fall under Generation 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Generation 3\"}"
