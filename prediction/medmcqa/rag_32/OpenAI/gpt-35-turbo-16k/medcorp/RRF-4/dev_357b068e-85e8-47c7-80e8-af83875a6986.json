    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best way to retain an orthodontically treated midline diastema, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [25] discusses the stability of maxillary interincisor diastema closure after extraction orthodontic treatment. Document [21] analyzes the closure, persistence, or reopening of the maxillary midline diastema after frenectomy. Document [11] mentions the importance of retainer efficiency in maintaining long-term stability. Based on this information, we can conclude that a retainer is necessary to retain the orthodontically treated midline diastema.

Bonded lingual retainer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
