    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To study the daily admission of head injury patients in a trauma care center, we need to analyze the frequency or count of admissions over time. Since we are interested in the number of admissions per day, the most appropriate distribution to use would be the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is commonly used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time, such as the number of head injury admissions per day in a trauma care center.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
