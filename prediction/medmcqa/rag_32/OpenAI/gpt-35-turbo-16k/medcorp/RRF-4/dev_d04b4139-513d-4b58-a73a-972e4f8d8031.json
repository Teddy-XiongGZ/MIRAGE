    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To avoid failure of partial dentures due to poor clasp design, we need to consider the factors that contribute to good clasp design. The documents mention that the failure rates of abutment teeth are the highest, and the failure rates of retainers are the second highest. It is also mentioned that the failure rates of connectors are generally low, but they increase suddenly after 6 years. Based on this information, we can conclude that clasp design plays a crucial role in the success of partial dentures. Considering the given options, stress breakers and bar type clasps are not specifically mentioned in the documents. Altering tooth contours may help in achieving better clasp retention, but it is not the best approach to avoid failure due to poor clasp design. The most appropriate option is to clasp only those teeth with fairly long crowns and normal bone support, as this ensures better stability and retention of the partial denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
