    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the relevant documents discuss various aspects of facial clefts, including their classifications, treatment plans, and associated anomalies. To determine the cause of a cleft in the facial region, we need to consider the information related to the embryogenesis and development of the face. The documents mention that facial clefts can affect different structures like bone, soft tissue, and skin. The Tessier classification describes the clefts at both soft tissue and bone levels. The Van der Meulen classification is based on embryogenesis. However, none of the documents explicitly state the specific cause of a cleft in the facial region. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the cause of a cleft based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
