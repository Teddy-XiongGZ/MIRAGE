    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the optimal time to employ an orthodontic appliance that takes advantage of growth, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that initial early orthodontic treatment usually begins at the deciduous dentition or early mixed dentition stage and continues for 12-18 months. Document [3] mentions that functional appliances must be used while the patient is still growing to achieve maximum benefit. Document [6] states that growth modification through functional appliances is ideally done through pubertal growth in pre-adolescent children and fixed appliances are used during permanent dentition. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the optimal time to employ an orthodontic appliance that takes advantage of growth is during the early mixed dentition stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
