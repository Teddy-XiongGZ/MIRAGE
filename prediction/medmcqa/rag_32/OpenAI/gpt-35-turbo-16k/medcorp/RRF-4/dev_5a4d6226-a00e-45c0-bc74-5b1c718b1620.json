    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Baroreceptors are sensory neurons that respond to changes in blood pressure. They act as part of a negative feedback system called the baroreflex, which helps regulate short-term blood pressure. When blood pressure increases, baroreceptors are activated and send signals to the central nervous system, resulting in decreased sympathetic signals to vessels and the heart, leading to vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. Conversely, when blood pressure decreases, baroreceptor firing decreases, leading to increased sympathetic stimulation, increased cardiac output, and vasoconstriction. Therefore, baroreceptors function as part of a negative feedback loop to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels. Based on this information, the answer is A. Negative feedback.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
