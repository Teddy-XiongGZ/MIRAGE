    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the prevalence, size, shape, location, and number of accessory canals in the pulpal floor of primary molars. Document [1] investigates the apical anatomy of C-shaped canal systems in mandibular second molars. Document [2] focuses on the prevalence of different types of accessory canals in the furcation area of third molars. Document [3] discusses the possibility of additional root canals in mandibular molars. Document [4] explores the racial predilection of C-shaped canal configuration in the mandibular second molar. Document [5] presents clinical reports and in vitro studies on the third canal in the mesial root of mandibular first molars. Document [6] assesses the anatomy of mandibular first molars using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Document [7] investigates the prevalence, location, and patency of accessory canals in primary molars. Document [8] examines the root and canal morphology of permanent mandibular molars in a Sri Lankan population. Document [9] evaluates the root canal anatomy and symmetry of maxillary and mandibular molars in a white population using CBCT. Document [10] reviews the prevalence and characteristics of accessory roots and root canals in anterior teeth. Document [11] uses CBCT to evaluate the root and canal morphology of mandibular molars in Chinese individuals. Document [12] presents a case report of a mandibular first molar with five root canals. Document [13] explores the incidence and characteristics of mandibular accessory canals using CBCT. Document [14] investigates the prevalence, location, and patency of accessory canals in the furcation area of permanent molars. Document [15] reviews the morphology and prevalence of middle canals in mandibular molars. Document [16] assesses the presence, location, and number of accessory or nutrient canals in the body of the mandible using CBCT images. Document [17] discusses the occurrence of multiple mandibular canals with two separate canals. Document [18] assesses the incidence and variability features of root canal systems and their ramifications using micro-CT. Document [19] reviews the prevalence and endodontic considerations of accessory roots in maxillary molar teeth. Document [20] investigates the frequency of middle mesial canals in mandibular first molars and its association with various anatomical variables. Document [21] presents a case report and literature review on the middle mesial canal of the mandibular first molar. Document [22] evaluates the incidence and related factors of middle mesial canals in mandibular molars. Document [23] determines the prevalence and morphometric analysis of three-rooted mandibular first molars in a Brazilian subpopulation. Document [24] investigates the prevalence, location, and patency of accessory canals in the furcation region of permanent molars. Document [25] examines the detection and negotiation of accessory mesial canals in mandibular molars using magnifying loupes or the operating microscope. Document [26] investigates the root canal morphology of permanent three-rooted mandibular first molars. Document [27] evaluates the internal morphology of distal roots of mandibular first molars using micro-CT. Document [28] examines the root canal morphology of three-rooted mandibular first molars. Document [29] investigates the internal morphology of the distal roots of mandibular first molars using micro-CT. Document [30] explores the characteristics of accessory mental foramina observed on limited CBCT images. Document [31] studies the distribution and position of accessory mandibular foramina in the mandibular body of Jiangxi adults using CBCT. After analyzing these documents, it can be concluded that the major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars is variable and depends on the age of the patient. Therefore, the answer is D. Variable pattern & depend on age of patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
