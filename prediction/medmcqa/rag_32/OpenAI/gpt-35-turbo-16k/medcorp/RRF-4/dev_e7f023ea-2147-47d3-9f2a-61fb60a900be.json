    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the antidote for fibrinolytic therapy, we need to identify a drug that can reverse the effects of fibrinolytic agents. Looking through the documents, we can see that streptokinase is a fibrinolytic agent used in therapy, not an antidote. Heparin is an anticoagulant, not an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy. Epsilon aminocaproic acid is a fibrinolytic inhibitor, but not specifically an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy. Protamine, on the other hand, is known to be an antidote for heparin, which is commonly used in anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Protamine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
