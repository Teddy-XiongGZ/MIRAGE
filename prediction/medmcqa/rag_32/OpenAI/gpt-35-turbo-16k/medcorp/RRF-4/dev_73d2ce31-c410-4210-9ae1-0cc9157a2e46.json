    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio, we need to determine the values of FEV1 and FVC from the spirometry curve. The FEV1 is the volume of air exhaled in the first second of forced expiration, and the FVC is the total volume of air exhaled forcefully after a maximal inhalation. From the spirometry curve, we can measure the FEV1 as the volume of air exhaled in the first second and the FVC as the total volume of air exhaled. Once we have these values, we can calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio by dividing the FEV1 by the FVC and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 60-69%\"}"
