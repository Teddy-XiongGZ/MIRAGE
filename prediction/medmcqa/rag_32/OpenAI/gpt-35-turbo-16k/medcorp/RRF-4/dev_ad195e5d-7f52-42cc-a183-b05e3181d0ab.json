    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's presentation and findings on echocardiogram, the most likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism. The dilation of the right ventricle and bulging of the interventricular septum to the left are consistent with right ventricular strain due to increased pulmonary artery pressure. The primary treatment modality for pulmonary embolism is anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin. Thrombectomy and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator are more invasive treatment options reserved for patients with massive or high-risk pulmonary embolism. IVC filter placement is typically considered in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation or recurrent embolism despite adequate anticoagulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
