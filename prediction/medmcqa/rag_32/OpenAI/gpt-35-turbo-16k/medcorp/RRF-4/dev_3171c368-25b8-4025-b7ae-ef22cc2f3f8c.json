    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-transcriptional modifications refer to the chemical alterations that occur to an RNA molecule after transcription. To determine which of the given options is not a post-transcriptional modification, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the major steps in post-transcriptional modification of mRNA include the addition of a 5' cap, the addition of a 3' polyadenylated tail, and RNA splicing. Document [13] also mentions that RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification. However, there is no mention of glycosylation as a post-transcriptional modification of RNA in any of the provided documents. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Glycosylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
