    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the stage in arterial gas analysis where maximum pCO2 is seen, we need to analyze the relevant documents for information about pCO2 levels. Document [4] states that under normal physiologic conditions, the value of PCO2 ranges between 35 to 45 mmHg. Document [23] mentions that in metabolic acidosis, for every 1 mEq/L drop of bicarbonate, there will be a decrease in PCO2 by 1.2 mmHg. Document [3] states that the collection of arterial blood gas is facilitated with the placement of an arterial catheter for hemodynamic monitoring. Based on this information, the maximum pCO2 is likely to be seen in stage D, which corresponds to the arterial blood gas collection stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
