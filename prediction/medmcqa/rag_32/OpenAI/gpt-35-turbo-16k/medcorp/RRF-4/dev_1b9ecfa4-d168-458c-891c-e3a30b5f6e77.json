    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine where an indirect retainer is placed, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. The term 'indirect retainer' refers to a component used in removable partial dentures to prevent displacement of the denture base. Document [2] mentions that the forms and locations of indirect retainers used for cross arch stabilization are altered to investigate characteristic movements of the denture bases and abutment teeth. It states that when the partial denture has only one indirect retainer used for cross arch stabilization, it is important that the positive rest is located on the anterior tooth and the indirect retainer is placed on as distal tooth as possible. This suggests that the indirect retainer should be placed near the distal tooth. Therefore, the answer choice is B. As far as possible from fulcrum line.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
