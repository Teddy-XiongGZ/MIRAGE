    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the key ridge useful in assessing malocclusion, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the use of intraoral frontal photographs to measure the maxillomandibular difference using the Wala Ridge. Document [19] specifically mentions the horizontal distance between the FA-WALA (Facial Axis Point-William Andrews and Larry Andrews) of posterior teeth in Angle's Class I, Class II, and Class III malocclusions. However, none of the documents explicitly state which bone the key ridge is present on. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the answer based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unknown\"}"
