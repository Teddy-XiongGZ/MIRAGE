    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maximum infective stage of hepatitis B is determined by the presence of viral antigens in the blood. HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is the antigen that is present during the maximum infective stage of hepatitis B. It indicates active viral replication and the highest risk of transmission. HBeAg (Hepatitis B e antigen) is also present during the maximum infective stage, but it is not the maximum infective stage itself. HBcAg (Hepatitis B core antigen) is not directly involved in the infective stage of hepatitis B. Anti-HBs (antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen) is actually a marker of immunity and indicates recovery or vaccination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
