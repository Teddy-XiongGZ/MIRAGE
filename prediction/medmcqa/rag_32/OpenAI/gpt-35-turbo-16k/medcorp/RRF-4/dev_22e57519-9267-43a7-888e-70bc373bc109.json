    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To diagnose rabies, the corneal scrapings should be tested for the presence of rabies virus. The most appropriate test for this purpose is PCR for rabies virus, as it can detect the viral RNA and confirm the diagnosis. Negri bodies are characteristic histopathological findings in rabies, but they are not specific and may not be present in all cases. Antibodies to rabies virus can be detected in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid, but they may not be present in the early stages of the disease. Indirect immunofluorescence can be used to detect rabies virus antigen, but PCR is a more sensitive and specific test for viral detection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
