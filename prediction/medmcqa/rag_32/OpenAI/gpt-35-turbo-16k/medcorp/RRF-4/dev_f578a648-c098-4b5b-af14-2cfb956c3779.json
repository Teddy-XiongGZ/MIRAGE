    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue can be caused by various factors. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Over extended lingual borders: This refers to the extension of dental restorations or prosthetics beyond the normal lingual borders. While this can cause discomfort or irritation, it is unlikely to specifically cause numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue.\\n\\nB. Sharp and rough lingual borders: Similar to option A, sharp and rough lingual borders can cause discomfort or irritation, but they are not likely to specifically cause numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue.\\n\\nC. Allergy to residual monomer of acrylic: This option refers to an allergic reaction to residual monomer, which is a component of acrylic used in dental restorations or prosthetics. While an allergic reaction can cause various symptoms, including oral discomfort, it is not a common cause of numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue.\\n\\nD. Excessive vertical dimension: This option refers to an increased vertical dimension of dental restorations or prosthetics, which can affect the occlusion and jaw position. While an excessive vertical dimension can cause various symptoms, including muscle discomfort or changes in speech, it is not a common cause of numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, none of the provided options are likely to be the specific cause of numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
