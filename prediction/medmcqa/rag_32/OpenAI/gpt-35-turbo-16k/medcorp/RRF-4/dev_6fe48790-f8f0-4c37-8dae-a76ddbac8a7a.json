    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis occurs when there is an increase in chloride concentration or a decrease in bicarbonate concentration. Proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a cause of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Severe pancreatitis can also cause normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Diarrhea can lead to a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis due to the loss of bicarbonate. Salicylates poisoning, on the other hand, typically causes an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Salicylates poisoning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
