    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common site of CSF rhinorrhoea, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the most common acquired defect in the skull base bones causing spontaneous nasal liquorrhea is often localized in the sphenoid bone (43%), followed by the ethmoid bone (29%) and the cribriform plate (29%). Document [16] also mentions that the ethmoid roof and the cribriform plate region are the sites most vulnerable to fractures and dural tears. Based on this information, we can conclude that the most common site of CSF rhinorrhoea is the Cribriform plate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
