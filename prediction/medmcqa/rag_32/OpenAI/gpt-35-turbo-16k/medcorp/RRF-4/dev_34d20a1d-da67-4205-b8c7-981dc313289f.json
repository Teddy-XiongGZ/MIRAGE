    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the system of depiction of the 32 teeth, we need to analyze the provided diagram. The diagram shows the numbering of the permanent teeth in the upper and lower jaws. The numbering starts from the right maxillary third molar (tooth number 1) and continues sequentially across the upper teeth to the left side. Then, the numbering starts at the left mandibular third molar (tooth number 17) and continues sequentially across the lower teeth to the right side. This numbering system corresponds to the Universal Numbering System, where the numbers 1-32 are used to designate the permanent teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Universal system\"}"
