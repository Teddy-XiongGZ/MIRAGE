    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a condition characterized by a defect in the bone overlying the superior semicircular canal, resulting in a third window phenomenon. This means that sound and pressure can directly stimulate the inner ear, leading to characteristic symptoms. SNHL (sensorineural hearing loss) is not typically associated with SSCD, as the defect primarily affects the conductive pathway. Tullio's phenomenon, which is sound-induced vertigo or nystagmus, is a classic symptom of SSCD. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) testing is a useful investigation for diagnosing SSCD, as it can demonstrate vestibular hypersensitivity to sound. Therefore, the correct answer is B. SNHL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
