    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document [0] provides information about the Schwartz formula for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in children. According to the document, the constant in the Schwartz formula depends on muscle mass, which itself varies with a child's age. Therefore, the constant in the Schwartz formula depends on age. The document also mentions that the method of estimation of creatinine and the severity of renal failure may affect the selection of the constant. However, it does not mention that the constant depends on mass. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Severity of renal failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
