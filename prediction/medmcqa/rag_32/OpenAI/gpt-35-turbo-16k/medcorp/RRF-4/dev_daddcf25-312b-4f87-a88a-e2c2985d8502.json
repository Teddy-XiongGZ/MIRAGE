    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain. To detect hydrocephalus antenatally, we need a diagnostic method that can visualize the fetal brain. X-ray abdomen and amniocentesis are not suitable for this purpose as they do not provide direct visualization of the brain. Clinical examination may provide some clues, but it is not the most accurate method for detecting hydrocephalus. Ultrasonography, on the other hand, is a commonly used imaging technique that can visualize the fetal brain and detect abnormalities such as hydrocephalus. Therefore, the best option for detecting hydrocephalus antenatally is ultrasonography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
