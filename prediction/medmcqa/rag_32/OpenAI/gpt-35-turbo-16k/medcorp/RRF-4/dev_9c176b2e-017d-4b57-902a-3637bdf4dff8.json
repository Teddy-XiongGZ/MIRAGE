    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Efferent arteriole constriction leads to increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure and decreased blood flow in peritubular vessels. This increased hydrostatic pressure helps maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, efferent arteriole constriction does not directly affect oncotic pressure in peritubular vessels. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased oncotic pressure in peritubular vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
