    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a polytrauma patient who had sudden drainage of 1,500 mL blood from the left side after chest tube insertion. The oxygen saturation is 92%. Given the significant blood loss and low oxygen saturation, immediate intervention is required. Auscultating for left chest breath sounds and waiting for saturation to rise is not appropriate as the patient is already experiencing significant blood loss and hypoxemia. Clamping the chest tube is also not appropriate as it would prevent further drainage of blood. Transfer to a trauma center may be necessary, but it is not the immediate next step. The most appropriate immediate next step is to prepare for immediate open thoracotomy to address the ongoing bleeding and potentially perform surgical intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
