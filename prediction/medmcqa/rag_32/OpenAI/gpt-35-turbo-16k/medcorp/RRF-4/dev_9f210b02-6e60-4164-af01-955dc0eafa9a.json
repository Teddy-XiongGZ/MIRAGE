    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the correct answer by eliminating the options that are true about dentinal tubules. \\n\\nOption A is true because the density of dentinal tubules is greatest near the pulp. \\n\\nOption B is not true because the diameter of dentinal tubules ranges from 2.5 \u03bcm near the pulp to 0.9 \u03bcm at the dentino-enamel junction, not 5 to 7\u03bcm. \\n\\nOption C is true because the diameter of dentinal tubules is greater near the pulp compared to the outer layer. \\n\\nOption D is not mentioned in the documents, so we cannot determine its accuracy. \\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The diameter of dentin tubules ranges from 5 to 7\u03bcm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
