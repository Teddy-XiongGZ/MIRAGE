    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Erythropoietin acts on erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. According to Document [6], erythropoietin binds to specific receptors on the surface of its target cells, stimulates the proliferation of colony-forming cells of the erythroid series, induces hemoglobin formation and erythroblast maturation, and releases reticulocytes in circulation. Based on this information, erythropoietin acts on CFU (colony-forming unit) and BFU (burst-forming unit) cells, which are erythroid progenitor cells. Therefore, the answer is A. CFU and D. BFU.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/D\"}"
