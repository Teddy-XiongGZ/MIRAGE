    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the region involved in a keyhole-shaped visual field defect, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. According to Document [25], the algorithm for visual fields, the keyhole-shaped visual field defect is part of the qualitative portion of perimetry and is used to map patterns of visual loss due to damage to the sensory visual system. Document [23] also mentions that patterns of visual loss are key to anatomic diagnosis. Based on this information, we can conclude that the keyhole-shaped visual field defect is indicative of a lesion in the sensory visual system. Looking at the potential choices, the only region mentioned in the documents that is part of the sensory visual system is the Occipital lobe. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Occipital lobe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
