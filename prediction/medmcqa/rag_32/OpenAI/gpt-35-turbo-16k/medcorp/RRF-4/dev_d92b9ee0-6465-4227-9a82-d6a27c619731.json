    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the characteristics of saliva in a caries-free individual, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that saliva has many components, each with a specific role in the prevention of dental caries. Document [10] mentions that saliva acts as a buffer and helps to prevent demineralization of teeth. Document [23] states that saliva influences caries attack mainly by its rate of flow and by its content of fluoride. Based on this information, we can conclude that in a caries-free individual, the saliva is likely to have a high buffering capacity for acids, as it helps to prevent demineralization of teeth and acts as a buffer against plaque acids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
