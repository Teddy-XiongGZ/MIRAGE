    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the marker appearing last in MI, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [10] states that cardiac troponins T and I are released within 4-6 hours of an MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, making them the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage. Document [12] also confirms that cardiac troponins (I and T) are components of the contractile apparatus of myocardial cells and are expressed almost exclusively in the heart. Elevated serum levels of cardiac troponin indicate an acute MI. Therefore, the marker appearing last in MI is Troponin T or Troponin I.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Troponin T\"}"
