    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In hyperparathyroidism, the primary effect is increased serum calcium levels. This is due to increased bone resorption, reduced kidney clearance of calcium, and increased intestinal calcium absorption. In terms of phosphate levels, primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with abnormally low serum phosphate levels. This is because PTH increases urinary phosphate excretion and inhibits proximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Therefore, the decreased phosphate levels seen in hyperparathyroidism are primarily due to increased renal phosphate excretion. Option C, decreased renal phosphate absorption, best describes this mechanism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
