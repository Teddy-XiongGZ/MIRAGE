    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cement is irritating to the pulp, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that many cements are acidic and irritate the pulp, but polycarboxylate cement is considered the most biocompatible type due to having the most rapid pH rise. Document [3] mentions that glass ionomer luting cements may show lower pH values for longer times than other cements, which can lead to damaging effects on the pulp. Document [8] suggests that glass ionomer cements, when tested with the basic laws of biocompatibility required of other cements, have shown little difference in pulpal response. Document [15] states that zinc phosphate cement can irritate the nerve pulp. Based on this information, the cement that is most likely irritating to the pulp is Zinc phosphate cement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
