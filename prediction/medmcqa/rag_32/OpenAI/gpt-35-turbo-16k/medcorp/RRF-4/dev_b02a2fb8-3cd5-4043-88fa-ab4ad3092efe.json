    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periapical inflammation is sustained by various factors. According to the documents, the primary cause of periapical inflammation is a polymicrobial infection of the pulp chamber, which stimulates the immune system to form a granulation tissue around the apical area. The immune response, including the activation and interaction of immune-inflammatory cells, contributes to tissue damage, bone resorption, and perpetuation of inflammation. The inflammatory response involves the influx and activation of immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, which release chemical mediators and enzymes that combat the microbial invasion but also cause tissue damage. Therefore, the sustained inflammation of periapical tissue is primarily due to the presence of microorganisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
