    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anesthetic agent can cause pain on IV administration, we need to search for information about the potential side effects of each agent. Looking through the relevant documents, we find that Document [21] titled 'Vecuronium dissolved in normal saline exaggerates pain on intravenous injection' discusses the pain associated with the intravenous administration of vecuronium dissolved in normal saline. However, none of the provided options (A. Ketamine, B. Propofol, C. Thiopentone, D. Midazolam) mention vecuronium. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine which anesthetic agent can cause pain on IV administration based on the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
