    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine at which stage of Nolla's the tooth starts erupting, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [2] mentions a case report of a 16-year-old adolescent whose bilateral upper second premolar germs were at Nolla's 6 stage. However, this document does not specifically state that tooth eruption starts at this stage. Document [3] states that the primary dentition stage starts on the arrival of the mandibular central incisors, typically from around six months, and lasts until the first permanent molars appear in the mouth, usually at six years. This suggests that tooth eruption starts after the arrival of the mandibular central incisors. Document [6] mentions that eruption of primary teeth into the mouth begins between the ages of 6 months and two years, with the bottom two front teeth, the bottom central incisors, being the first to erupt. This further supports the idea that tooth eruption starts after the eruption of the mandibular central incisors. Based on this information, the most likely answer is A. Stage 5, as this is the stage at which the mandibular central incisors typically erupt.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
