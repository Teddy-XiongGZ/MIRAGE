    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The bias that arises from evaluating data on patients and hospital records only such that the probability of exposure to a particular factor is increased is known as selection bias. Selection bias occurs when the study population is not representative of the target population, leading to a distorted estimate of the association between exposure and outcome. In this case, the bias is specifically related to the selection of patients and hospital records, which can result in an overrepresentation of certain exposures. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
