According to Document [4], Pearson's chi-squared test is used to assess three types of comparison: goodness of fit, homogeneity, and independence. A test of goodness of fit establishes whether an observed frequency distribution differs from a theoretical distribution. A test of homogeneity compares the distribution of counts for two or more groups using the same categorical variable. A test of independence assesses whether observations consisting of measures on two variables, expressed in a contingency table, are independent of each other. Document [15] further explains that the Chi-square test is a statistical test which measures the association between two categorical variables. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Association between two variables.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
