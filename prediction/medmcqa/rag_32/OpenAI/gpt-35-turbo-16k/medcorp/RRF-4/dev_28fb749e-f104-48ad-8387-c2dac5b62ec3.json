    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can evaluate the advantages of mediolateral episiotomy over midline episiotomy. Document [0] states that midline episiotomy is associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of lacerations among primiparous and multiparous women. Document [4] also mentions that restrictive use of mediolateral episiotomy compared to routine use results in less severe perineal trauma and fewer healing complications. Therefore, the advantage of mediolateral episiotomy over midline episiotomy is that it leads to fewer breakdowns and less severe perineal trauma. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Fewer breakdowns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
