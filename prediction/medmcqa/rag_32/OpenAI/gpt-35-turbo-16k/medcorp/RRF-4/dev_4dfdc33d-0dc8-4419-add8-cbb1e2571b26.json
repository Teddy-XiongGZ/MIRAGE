    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prolong the setting time of ZnPO4, we need to consider methods that slow down the setting reaction. Adding a drop of distilled water, prolonging spatulation time, and mixing on a cooled glass slab can all help slow down the setting reaction. However, small increments of addition of powder to liquid can actually accelerate the setting reaction by increasing the concentration of reactants. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Small increment of addition of powder to liquid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
