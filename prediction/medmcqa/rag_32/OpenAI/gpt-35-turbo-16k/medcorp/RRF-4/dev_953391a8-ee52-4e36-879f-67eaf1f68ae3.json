    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which fibers take up the maximum masticatory forces, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [7] mentions that the masticatory muscles in human beings and other mammals have specific adaptations and contain different isoforms of myosin heavy chain (MHC). The fast muscle fibers of the masticatory muscles have smaller calibers than the slow ones, indicating mild atrophy. Document [12] states that motor unit territories in masticatory muscles are smaller than in limb muscles, suggesting a more localized organization of motor control. Additionally, the proportion of slow-type motor units is relatively large in deep and anterior masticatory muscle regions, while more fast-type units are common in the superficial and posterior muscle regions. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the slow-type motor units, which are more prevalent in the deep and anterior regions of the masticatory muscles, are likely to take up the maximum masticatory forces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
