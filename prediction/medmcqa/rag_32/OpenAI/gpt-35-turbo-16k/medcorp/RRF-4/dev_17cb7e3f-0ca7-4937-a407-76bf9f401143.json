    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the 10-year-old boy has a complicated crown fracture with abscess formation in tooth 12. Tooth 12 has an immature blunderbuss canal, while tooth 11 has complete root formation but negative vitality. The management of this patient would involve addressing the abscess and treating the infected tooth. Since tooth 12 has an immature blunderbuss canal, revascularization would be the appropriate treatment option to encourage continued root development and resolution of the abscess. Tooth 11, which has complete root formation but negative vitality, would require root canal treatment (RCT) to address the infection. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Revascularization in 12 and RCT of 11.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
