    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which enzymes are elevated in the plasma in MI, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the markers most widely used in the detection of MI are the MB subtype of the enzyme creatine kinase (CPK-MB) and cardiac troponins T and I. Document [6] also mentions that creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme 1 are highly sensitive and specific for acute injury to the heart, particularly acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, the correct answer is A. CPK-MB.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
