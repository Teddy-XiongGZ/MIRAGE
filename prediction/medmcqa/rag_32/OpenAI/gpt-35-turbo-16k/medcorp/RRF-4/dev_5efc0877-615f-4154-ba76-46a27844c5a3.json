    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the concentration of adrenaline in local anaesthetic solutions for achieving haemostasis and vasoconstriction at the surgical site varies. Document [3] states that the concentration of adrenaline used in the study was 1:400,000 and 1:200,000. Document [7] mentions the use of adrenaline 1:80000 in the solution. Document [13] mentions the use of adrenaline 1:100,000. Document [27] compares the effect of adrenaline 1:160,000 and adrenaline 1:80,000. Based on these references, it can be concluded that the concentration of adrenaline in local anaesthetic solutions for achieving haemostasis and vasoconstriction at the surgical site can vary, but one of the commonly used concentrations is 1:80000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 1:80000\"}"
