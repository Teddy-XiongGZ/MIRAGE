    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the vasopressin antagonist acts on the medullary collecting duct. This is supported by the data that shows the antagonist reduces whole kidney fractional reabsorption of fluid, increases urinary flow rate and electrolyte-free-water clearance, and reduces urinary osmolality. These effects indicate a predominant aquaretic effect of the antagonist, which is located downstream of the early distal tubule. The medullary collecting duct is the part of the nephron responsible for water reabsorption and concentration of urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
