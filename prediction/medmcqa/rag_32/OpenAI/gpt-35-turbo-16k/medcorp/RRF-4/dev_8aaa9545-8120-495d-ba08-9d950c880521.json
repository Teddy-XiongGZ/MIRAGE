    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the 4-year-old patient has severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) with recurrent gingival swelling and pain in teeth 61 and 62. The treatment plan described in Document [0] for a similar case of S-ECC involved behavior changes in oral hygiene habits, exodontias of all primary teeth, and oral rehabilitation with a prosthesis. However, since the question does not mention the extent of the caries or the overall condition of the teeth, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate treatment option. Endodontic treatment, restoration, and extraction are all potential treatment options for S-ECC depending on the severity and extent of the caries. Fluoride application alone may not be sufficient for the management of S-ECC. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to definitively choose one treatment option over the others.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot determine\"}"
