    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Saliva is initially formed in the salivary glands as primary saliva, which is isotonic to plasma. As the saliva passes through the ductal system, it undergoes ion exchanges, including the absorption of sodium and chloride ions and the secretion of potassium and bicarbonate ions. These ion exchanges result in the modification of the saliva, making it hypotonic compared to plasma. Therefore, the answer is B. Hypotonic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
