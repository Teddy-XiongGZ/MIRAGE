    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method used to amplify DNA. In PCR, DNA polymerase is used to synthesize new DNA strands. Taq polymerase, a type of DNA polymerase, is commonly used in PCR because it is heat-stable and can withstand the high temperatures required for denaturation. Dideoxyribonucleotides (ddNTPs) are used in DNA sequencing, not in PCR. A DNA template is necessary for PCR because it serves as the starting material for amplification. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Dideoxyribonucleotides.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
