    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rosettes are histopathological structures characterized by neoplastic cells arranged around a central core or hub. They can be seen in various tumor types. To determine which tumor types are associated with rosette formation, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions rosette structures in lymph node biopsies of follicular lymphoma, but it does not specify if these are the same type of rosettes as seen in the question. Document [1] describes rosette-like structures in a compound melanocytic nevus, which is not one of the options in the question. Document [2] mentions pseudorosettes (Homer-Wright rosettes) in esthesioneuroblastoma, which is not one of the options in the question. Document [3] states that the presence of primary rosettes may suggest a given diagnosis, but it does not specify which tumor types are associated with primary rosettes. Document [4] describes perivascular pseudorosettes in malignant melanoma, which is not one of the options in the question. Document [8] mentions rosette-like features in osteosarcoma, which is not one of the options in the question. Document [10] mentions rosettes in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but it does not specify if these are the same type of rosettes as seen in the question. Document [14] mentions rosette formation in osteosarcoma, which is not one of the options in the question. Document [21] describes rosettes as a specific form of a white shiny structure seen with polarized dermoscopy, but it does not specify which tumor types are associated with rosette formation. Document [25] mentions rosettes in retinoblastoma, which is one of the options in the question. Document [29] mentions rosette-like structures in Spitz nevi, which is not one of the options in the question. Based on the analysis of the relevant documents, the tumor type associated with rosette formation is retinoblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
