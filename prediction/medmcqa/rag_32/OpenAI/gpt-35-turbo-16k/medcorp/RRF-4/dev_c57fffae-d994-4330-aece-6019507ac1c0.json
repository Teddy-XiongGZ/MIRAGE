Karyotyping is the process of preparing and studying the complete set of metaphase chromosomes in the cells of a species or an individual organism. It involves examining the chromosomes under a light microscope to determine their length, position of the centromeres, banding pattern, and any other physical characteristics. This process allows for the identification of chromosomal abnormalities and provides information about the structure and organization of the chromosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
