    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can gather information about the development and characteristics of the condylar cartilage at birth. Document [7] mentions that at birth, the condyle is a fibrous cartilaginous structure surrounded by membranous bone. Document [15] states that the condyle is anchored in the mandible by a conical process, which can be observed macroscopically up to newborn age. Document [25] describes that the cartilage layer of the condyle is lacking in the fossa but is present on the tuberculum at birth. From these descriptions, we can conclude that the condylar cartilage at birth has a fibrous cartilaginous structure and is present on the tuberculum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
