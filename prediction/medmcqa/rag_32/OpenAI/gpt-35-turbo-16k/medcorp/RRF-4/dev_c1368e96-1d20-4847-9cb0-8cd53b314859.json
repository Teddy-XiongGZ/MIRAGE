    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the check point for ZMC fracture reduction, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [4] mentions that the most common surgical approach for ZMC fractures is through a gingivobuccal groin incision, which provides exposure of the zygomatico-maxillary buttress region, which is the main buttress of the ZMC. Document [8] also mentions that the ZF suture is the most reliable site for assessing anatomical alignment and securing rigidity. Based on this information, the check point for ZMC fracture reduction is likely the zygomatico-maxillary buttress region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Zygomatico-maxillary buttress region\"}"
