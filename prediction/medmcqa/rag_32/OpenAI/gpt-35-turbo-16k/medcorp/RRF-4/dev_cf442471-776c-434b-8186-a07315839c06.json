    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the percentage of accessory canals found in the apical third of the root, we need to analyze the relevant documents that provide information on the incidence and distribution of accessory canals. Document [0] states that the incidence of teeth with accessory canals in the apical 3 mm was 46% for maxillary central incisors, 29% for lateral incisors, and 38% for canines. Document [2] mentions that accessory canals were found in 5% of the teeth. Document [5] states that the prevalence of accessory canals in C-shaped root canal systems of mandibular second molars was 41%. Based on this information, we can conclude that the percentage of accessory canals found in the apical third of the root is less than 50%. Therefore, the correct answer is not A or C. Since the exact percentage is not provided in the documents, we cannot definitively determine whether it is 54% or 60%. However, based on the information provided, it is more likely to be closer to 60%. Therefore, the answer is D. 60%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
