    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the provided documents, adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended as the initial treatment of choice for anaphylaxis. It acts on both beta-receptors and alpha-receptors. Adrenaline causes bronchodilation by stimulating beta-receptors, and it also has cardiovascular effects by stimulating beta-receptors. Additionally, adrenaline acts on blood vessels by stimulating alpha-receptors, causing vasoconstriction. However, there is no mention of adrenaline acting on presynaptic alpha-receptors in the provided documents. Therefore, the action of adrenaline on presynaptic alpha-receptors is not observed in the management of anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
