    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The respiratory center is responsible for regulating the rate and depth of breathing. It receives input from chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, the cerebral cortex, and the hypothalamus. The respiratory center is stimulated by altered levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and blood pH. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centers. Therefore, the best stimulator of the respiratory center is an increase in arterial carbon dioxide level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
