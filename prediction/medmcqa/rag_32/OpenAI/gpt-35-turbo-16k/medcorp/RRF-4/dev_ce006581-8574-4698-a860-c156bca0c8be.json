    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for an estimated prevalence of 10% and a sample size of 100, we can use the formula for estimating a proportion with a known sample size. The formula is: CI = p \u00b1 Z * sqrt((p * (1-p)) / n), where p is the estimated prevalence, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 95% confidence corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96), and n is the sample size. Plugging in the values, we get: CI = 0.10 \u00b1 1.96 * sqrt((0.10 * (1-0.10)) / 100). Calculating this expression gives us the confidence interval for the estimated prevalence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
