    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the refractive power of different components of the eye. Document [6] states that the total refractive power of the human eye is estimated to be about +60 diopters (D), and the cornea's anterior and posterior surfaces contribute to the refractive power. Document [2] mentions that photorefractive keratectomy changes the epithelium and anterior surface of the corneal stroma, but does not affect the posterior stroma or other ocular media. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the anterior surface of the cornea contributes significantly to the refractive power of the eye. Therefore, the answer is A. Anterior surface of cornea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
