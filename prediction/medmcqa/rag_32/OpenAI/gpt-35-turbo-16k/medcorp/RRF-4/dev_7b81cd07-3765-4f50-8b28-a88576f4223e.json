    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the child's behavior is traced to dental difficulties from his mother. The most satisfactory method of handling the situation would be to modify his fear by familiarization. This can be achieved through techniques such as tell-show-do, where the child is gradually introduced to the dental environment and procedures in a non-threatening and familiar way. Introducing another child as a good example may not directly address the child's fear and dental difficulties. Using small amounts of barbiturates is not recommended as it may have adverse effects on the child's health and behavior. Using firmness alone may not effectively address the underlying fear and dental difficulties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
