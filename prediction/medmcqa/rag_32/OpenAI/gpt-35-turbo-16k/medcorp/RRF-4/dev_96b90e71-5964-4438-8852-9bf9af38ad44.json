    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 10-year-old with bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) and a congenitally missing lateral incisor with an impacted canine. The treatment approach for this patient would typically involve a combination of surgical alveolar bone grafting (SABG) and expansion. The SABG is necessary to close the alveolar cleft and provide support for the eruption of the impacted canine. Expansion is needed to address any maxillary transverse width discrepancies and create space for the impacted canine to erupt. Therefore, the correct answer is B. SABG followed by expansion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
