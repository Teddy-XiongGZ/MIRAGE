    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most characteristic feature of basal cell carcinoma, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [12] describes the histopathology of nodular basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common subtype. It mentions that histopathology shows aggregates of basaloid cells with well-defined borders, showing a peripheral palisading of cells and one or more typical clefts. Document [13] also mentions that basal cell carcinoma cells appear similar to epidermal basal cells and are usually well differentiated. In uncertain cases, immunohistochemistry using BerEP4 can be used, having a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting only BCC cells. Based on this information, the most characteristic feature of basal cell carcinoma is nuclear palisading, as described in Document [12].\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
