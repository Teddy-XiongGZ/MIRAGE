    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with failure to thrive, polyuria, and medullary nephrocalcinosis. The blood pH is alkalotic, bicarbonate is normal, and there is hypokalemia and hypochloremia. These findings are consistent with distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), which is characterized by impaired acid secretion in the distal tubules. This leads to an inability to excrete hydrogen ions and reabsorb bicarbonate, resulting in metabolic alkalosis. The hypokalemia and hypochloremia are secondary to the impaired acid secretion. The other options, primary hyperaldosteronism, Bartter syndrome, and pseudohypoaldosteronism, do not typically present with medullary nephrocalcinosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
