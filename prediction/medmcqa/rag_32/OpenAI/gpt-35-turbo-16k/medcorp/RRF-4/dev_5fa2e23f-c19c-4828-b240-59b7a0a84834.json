    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the ideal temperature in the delivery room for neonates to be kept in a warmer, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [4] states that there is no general recommendation for the optimal environmental temperature in the delivery room. Document [7] mentions that the AHA 2022 CPR guidelines recommend maintaining infant temperatures between 36.5\u00b0C and 37.5\u00b0C for optimal outcomes. Document [15] suggests that neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation should be placed in a plastic bag or wrapped immediately at birth, while maintaining routine precautions such as warming the delivery room. Document [16] conducted a randomized controlled trial and found that placing infants <29 weeks gestation in polyurethane bags in the delivery room reduced the occurrence of hypothermia. Based on this information, it is clear that there is no specific temperature range mentioned in the documents for the delivery room. However, maintaining a temperature range of 36.5\u00b0C to 37.5\u00b0C for the neonates is recommended for optimal outcomes. Therefore, the answer is D. 37degC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
