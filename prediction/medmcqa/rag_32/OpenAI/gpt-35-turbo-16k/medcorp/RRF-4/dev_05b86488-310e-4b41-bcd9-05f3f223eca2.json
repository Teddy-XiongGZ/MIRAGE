    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the main concern during prosthodontics surgery and better prosthetic prognosis, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the main prosthetic determinants of the prognosis of implant-supported prostheses, including implant-connection, loading protocol, transmucosal abutments, prosthetic fit, provisionalization, type of retention, impression technique, fabrication technique, and occlusion. Document [4] mentions that the most frequent major complication in implant fixed complete dental prostheses is chipping of the acrylic denture teeth. Document [5] discusses the use of a staged approach with fixed interim prostheses throughout the rehabilitation process. Document [14] highlights the importance of selecting the most suitable maxillofacial prosthetic material and appropriate retentive aid for each patient. Based on this information, the main concern during prosthodontics surgery and better prosthetic prognosis is likely related to the factors mentioned in Document [0], such as implant-connection, prosthetic fit, and occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
