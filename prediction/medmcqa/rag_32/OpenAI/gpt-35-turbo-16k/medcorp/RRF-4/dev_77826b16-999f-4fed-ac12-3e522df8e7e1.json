    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options is least sensitive to radiation exposure, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that the most radiosensitive organs are bone marrow, lung, stomach, and large bowel. Document [4] mentions that the central nervous system (nerve) is affected by radiation exposure. However, there is no specific mention of muscle sensitivity to radiation exposure in the provided documents. Based on this information, we can conclude that muscle is least sensitive to radiation exposure compared to bone, hematopoietic tissue, and nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
