    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to determine the best drug to manage the patient with new onset focal seizures. Looking at the provided documents, we can see that Document [0] mentions that seizures may be focal or generalized depending on their origin. Document [27] also mentions that focal seizures can be managed with behavioral arrest, automatisms, cognitive, autonomic, emotional, or hyperkinetic variants. Based on this information, we can conclude that the best drug to manage the patient with new onset focal seizures would be a drug that is effective for focal seizures. Looking at the potential choices, Sodium valproate (Choice A) is commonly used for focal seizures, so it is a possible answer. Oxcarbazepine (Choice B) is also used for focal seizures, so it is another possible answer. Leviteracetam (Choice C) is mentioned in Document [2] as having the safest side effect profile and least number of drug-drug interactions compared to other antiepileptic drugs, but it does not specifically mention its effectiveness for focal seizures. Pregabalin (Choice D) is not mentioned in any of the provided documents in relation to focal seizures. Therefore, based on the information provided, the best drug to manage the patient with new onset focal seizures would be either Sodium valproate (Choice A) or Oxcarbazepine (Choice B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
