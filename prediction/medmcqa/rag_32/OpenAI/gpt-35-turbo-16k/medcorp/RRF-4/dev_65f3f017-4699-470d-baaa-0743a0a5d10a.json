    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which condition infective endocarditis is not seen in, we need to understand the relationship between infective endocarditis and the given conditions. Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium or heart valves. It can occur in individuals with underlying structural valve disease, including congenital heart disease. ASD (atrial septal defect), TOF (tetralogy of Fallot), VSD (ventricular septal defect), and MR (mitral regurgitation) are all types of congenital heart defects. Therefore, infective endocarditis can potentially occur in individuals with any of these conditions. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively state that infective endocarditis is not seen in any of these conditions. Therefore, the answer is not determinable based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not determinable\"}"
