    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, indirect retention is designed to resist tissue ward movement of an extension base partial denture. This is mentioned in Document [4] which states that indirect retention is required to prevent displacement of saddles, such as free-end saddles or anterior saddle which is curved outside a straight line between the abutment teeth. Indirect retention can only be achieved where both claps and rests work together to form a lever system (Class III lever system) to retain the free part of the denture. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Resist tissue ward movement of an extension base partial denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
