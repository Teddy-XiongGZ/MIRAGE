    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the answer, we need to find information about 4th generation apex locators in the provided documents. Document [12] mentions that the third generation of apex locators solved the problem of false readings caused by conductive fluids by using two alternating frequencies and calculating the impedance between them. Therefore, it is likely that the 4th generation apex locators are also impedance-based. To confirm this, we can check other documents that discuss the different generations of apex locators.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Impedence based\"}"
