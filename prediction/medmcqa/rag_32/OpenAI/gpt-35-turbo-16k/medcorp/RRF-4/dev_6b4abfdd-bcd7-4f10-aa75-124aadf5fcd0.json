    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the number of divisions in the 2 ml syringe that will give 180 mg of ceftriaxone, we need to calculate the volume of the solution that contains 180 mg of ceftriaxone. Given that the concentration of ceftriaxone in the solution is 500 mg/5 ml, we can set up a proportion to find the volume of the solution needed: (180 mg) / (500 mg) = (x ml) / (5 ml) Cross-multiplying, we get: 180 mg * 5 ml = 500 mg * x ml 900 ml = 500x Dividing both sides by 500, we find: x = 900 ml / 500 = 1.8 ml Since the syringe has 10 divisions per ml, we multiply the volume (1.8 ml) by the number of divisions per ml (10) to find the total number of divisions needed: 1.8 ml * 10 divisions/ml = 18 divisions Therefore, the answer is B. 18 divisions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
