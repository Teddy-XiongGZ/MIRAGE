    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Real-time PCR is commonly used for viral load quantification in various viral infections. To determine which of the given options does not require viral load quantification by Real Time PCR, we need to consider the specific characteristics of each infection and the role of viral load monitoring. \\n\\nA. Person with hepatitis B on Tenofovir therapy: Viral load monitoring is important in patients with hepatitis B on antiviral therapy, such as Tenofovir, to assess treatment response and detect viral resistance. Therefore, viral load quantification by Real Time PCR is relevant in this case.\\n\\nB. HSV causing temporal encephalitis: Viral load monitoring is not typically performed in cases of HSV encephalitis. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, imaging studies, and detection of HSV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by PCR. Therefore, viral load quantification by Real Time PCR is not necessary in this case.\\n\\nC. BK virus in patient of allograft renal transplant: BK virus can cause renal complications in transplant recipients. Viral load monitoring by Real Time PCR is important in assessing the risk of BK virus-associated nephropathy and guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, viral load quantification by Real Time PCR is relevant in this case.\\n\\nD. CMV PCR in blood of patient of liver transplant: CMV infection is a common complication in liver transplant recipients. Viral load monitoring by Real Time PCR is crucial in detecting and managing CMV infection in these patients. Therefore, viral load quantification by Real Time PCR is relevant in this case.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. HSV causing temporal encephalitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
