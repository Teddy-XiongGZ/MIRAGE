    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the extra retention in abutment teeth, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] mentions that the retention of removable dental prostheses can be achieved through various methods, including clasps, adhesive attachments, crowns, and fixed partial dentures with intra- or extracoronal attachments. Document [29] discusses the use of composite resin to modify abutment contours and improve removable prosthesis retention. Document [30] compares the retention and durability of different attachment systems for overdentures. Based on this information, it can be concluded that extra retention in abutment teeth is obtained with slots, pins, and grooves, as mentioned in Document [29].\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Slots, pins and grooves\"}"
