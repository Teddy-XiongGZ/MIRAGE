    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the drugs can be stopped abruptly without any withdrawal symptoms, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [26] states that escitalopram can induce withdrawal symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and lethargy, if discontinued abruptly. Document [29] mentions that abruptly stopping antidepressant drugs can sometimes result in 'rebound' hypomania or mania. Therefore, we can conclude that escitalopram (choice A) cannot be stopped abruptly without any withdrawal symptoms. However, there is no specific information in the provided documents about the withdrawal symptoms associated with fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, or seraline. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine if these drugs can be stopped abruptly without any withdrawal symptoms. Based on the available information, the answer is inconclusive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"E\"}"
