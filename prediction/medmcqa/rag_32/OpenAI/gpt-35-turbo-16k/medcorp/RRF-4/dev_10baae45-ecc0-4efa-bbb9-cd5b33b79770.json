    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The McRoberts maneuver involves sudden hyperflexion of the thigh over the abdomen. To determine which nerve is commonly involved in this maneuver, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. Document [0] mentions that lesions of the proximal femoral nerve can cause weakness of hip flexion, quadriceps atrophy, weakness of knee extension, and an absent patellar reflex. However, it also states that adduction of the thigh is spared as these muscles are supplied by the obturator nerve. Document [2] mentions that injuries to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can result in meralgia paresthetica, which manifests as tingling and pain to the anterolateral upper thigh. Based on this information, it is likely that the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is commonly involved in the McRoberts maneuver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lateral cutaneous Nerve of thigh\"}"
