    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the impact of a new drug combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy on the incidence and prevalence of metastatic melanoma. Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease occurring in a population over a specific period of time, while prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a specific point in time. If the new drug combination prolongs survival, it means that patients with metastatic melanoma are living longer. This would result in a decrease in the incidence of metastatic melanoma because fewer new cases are being diagnosed. However, the prevalence of metastatic melanoma would increase because more people are living with the disease. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Incidence remains the same and prevalence increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
