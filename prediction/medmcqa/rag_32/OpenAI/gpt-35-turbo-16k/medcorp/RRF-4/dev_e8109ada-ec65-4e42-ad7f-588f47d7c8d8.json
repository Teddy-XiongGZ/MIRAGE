    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which nerve biopsy is taken to diagnose neuritic leprosy, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that patients presenting with mononeuropathy and multiple mononeuropathies presumably with leprosy, without skin lesions, underwent nerve biopsy. Document [1] states that a biopsy of a representative cutaneous nerve near the site of the neurological deficit was taken for histopathological examination. Document [2] mentions investigations such as skin, nerve, and nasal biopsies were carried out. Document [6] discusses the controversy surrounding biopsies of the superficial sensory branch of the radial nerve. Document [7] suggests that fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of an affected nerve can be a valuable and less invasive procedure for the diagnosis of pure neuritic leprosy. Based on this information, it can be concluded that nerve biopsies are taken from the affected nerves in patients with neuritic leprosy. However, there is no specific mention of a particular nerve biopsy being taken exclusively for the diagnosis of neuritic leprosy. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be determined from the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
