    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cephalometric analysis is used to evaluate growth changes by superimposing cephalometric radiographs on stable reference structures. The relevant documents mention several methods of superimposition, including the sella-nasion (SN) method, the cranial base method, and the basion-nasion (Ricketts) method. However, none of the documents specifically mention the superimposition on the mandibular plane, FHP (Frankfurt Horizontal Plane), or occlusal plane. Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options. \", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
