    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old female with normal pubic hair and breast development, but presenting with primary amenorrhea. The investigation shows a normal karyotype. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Mullerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome). This condition is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper vagina, while the external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics are typically normal. Turner syndrome is characterized by a 45,X karyotype and would not present with normal breast development and pubic hair. Testicular feminization (also known as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome) is characterized by a 46,XY karyotype, but the external genitalia appear female and there is no pubic hair development. Kallmann syndrome is characterized by delayed or absent puberty, but it typically presents with anosmia (loss of sense of smell) as well. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Mullerian agenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
