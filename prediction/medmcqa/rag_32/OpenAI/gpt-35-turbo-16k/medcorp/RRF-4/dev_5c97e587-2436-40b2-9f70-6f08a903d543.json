    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which option does not decrease patient radiation in intraoral radiography, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that dose to organs not of diagnostic importance is reduced by approximately an order of magnitude when rectangular collimation and E-speed film are used. Document [1] mentions that patient dose may be reduced by half by changing from D-speed film to E-speed film. Document [2] states that the radiation dose reduction is 40-50% considering that the dose from a panoramic radiograph approximately corresponds to 2-4 intraoral radiographs. Document [12] mentions that the use of fast (E-speed) film offers a dose reduction of approximately 50%. Based on this information, we can conclude that high speed film (option A) decreases patient radiation in intraoral radiography. Document [1] also mentions that changing from calcium tungstate intensifying screens to rare-earth intensifying screens for panoramic and cephalometric radiography reduces patient dose by more than half. Therefore, intensifying screens (option B) also decrease patient radiation. Document [0] mentions that dose to the thyroid and breast is further reduced by a third with the use of a full leaded apron and thyroid shield. Therefore, a lead apron (option C) also decreases patient radiation. Finally, decreasing kVp (option D) is not mentioned in any of the documents as a method to decrease patient radiation in intraoral radiography. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Decreasing kVp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
