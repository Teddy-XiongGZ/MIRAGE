    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To confirm the diagnosis of internal derangement of TMJ fracture, we need a diagnostic method that can provide detailed views of the TMJ and its internal structures. Panoramic radiographs are useful for initial diagnosis, but they may not provide enough information to confirm the diagnosis. MRI (Choice A) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can provide detailed images of the TMJ and its internal structures, making it a suitable choice for confirming the diagnosis of internal derangement. CT scan (Choice B) can also provide detailed views of the TMJ, but it involves radiation exposure and may not be necessary for confirming the diagnosis in this case. Arthroscopy (Choice C) is an invasive procedure that allows direct visualization of the TMJ, but it is typically used for therapeutic purposes rather than confirming the diagnosis. Bone scan (Choice D) is not typically used for diagnosing internal derangement of the TMJ. Therefore, the most appropriate choice for confirming the diagnosis of internal derangement of TMJ fracture after a panoramic view is MRI (Choice A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
