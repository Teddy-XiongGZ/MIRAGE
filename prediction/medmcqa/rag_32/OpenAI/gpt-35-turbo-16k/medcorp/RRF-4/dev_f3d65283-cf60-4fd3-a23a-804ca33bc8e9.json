    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the capillary oncotic pressure, we need to use the Starling equation: Net filtration pressure = (capillary hydrostatic pressure - interstitial hydrostatic pressure) - (capillary oncotic pressure - interstitial oncotic pressure). Given that the net filtration pressure is 3 mm Hg, the capillary hydrostatic pressure is 25 mm Hg, the interstitial hydrostatic pressure is 2 mm Hg, and the interstitial oncotic pressure is 7 mm Hg, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the capillary oncotic pressure: capillary oncotic pressure = (capillary hydrostatic pressure - interstitial hydrostatic pressure) - (net filtration pressure + interstitial oncotic pressure). Plugging in the values, we get: capillary oncotic pressure = (25 - 2) - (3 + 7) = 25 - 2 - 3 - 7 = 13 mm Hg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
