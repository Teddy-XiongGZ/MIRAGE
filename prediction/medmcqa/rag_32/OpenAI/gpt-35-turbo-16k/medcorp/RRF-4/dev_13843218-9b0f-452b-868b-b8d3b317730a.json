    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, enamel rods are composed of tightly packed hydroxyapatite crystals. The arrangement of the crystals within each enamel rod is complex. According to Document [14], the enamel crystallites in the head of the enamel rod are oriented parallel to the long axis of the rod. In the tail of the enamel rod, the crystallites' orientation diverges slightly (65 degrees) from the long axis. Therefore, the orientation of hydroxyapatite crystals in the enamel rods is not 0 degrees in the center and not 45 degrees at the periphery. The correct answer is D. None.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
