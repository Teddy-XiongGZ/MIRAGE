    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the risk of endocarditis in different lesions, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [4] states that the incidence of endocarditis is increased in patients with cardiac lesions causing turbulent flow. Document [24] provides a list of risk factors for endocarditis, including age-related degenerative valvular lesions, congenital heart valve abnormalities, and coexisting conditions that suppress immunity. Document [22] mentions that in developed countries, congenital heart disease is the most important predisposing factor for endocarditis. Based on this information, we can conclude that the risk of endocarditis is increased in patients with valvular lesions. Therefore, the correct answer is not mentioned in the options provided. \", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
