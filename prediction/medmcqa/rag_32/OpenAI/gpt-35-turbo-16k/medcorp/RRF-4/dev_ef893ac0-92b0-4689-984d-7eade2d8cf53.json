    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the primary cause of repeated fracture of a porcelain fused to metal restoration, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that repair of porcelain fractures in ceramometal fixed partial dentures can be challenging, especially in the anterior region where esthetics is important. Document [2] also discusses the challenges of repairing porcelain fractures in ceramo-metal fixed bridges, emphasizing the difficulty in matching color and texture with the surrounding intact porcelain. Document [4] states that the success of composite resin bonded repairs for porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations is not as favorable as other repair techniques. Document [18] mentions that fractures in metal-ceramic restorations can occur due to inadequate metal support, excessive porcelain thickness, technical flaws, and occlusal forces. Based on this information, the most likely cause of repeated fracture of a porcelain fused to metal restoration is occlusal trauma, as mentioned in option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
