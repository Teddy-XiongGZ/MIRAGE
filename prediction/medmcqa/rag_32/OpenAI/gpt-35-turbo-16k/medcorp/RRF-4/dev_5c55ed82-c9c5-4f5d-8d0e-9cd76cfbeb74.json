    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most accurate and safe method to diagnose a viable pregnancy at 6 weeks is through ultrasound (USG) for fetal cardiac activity. This is because at 6 weeks gestation, the fetal cardiac activity can be visualized using ultrasound. Doppler assessment of fetal cardiac activity is not as accurate as USG for visualizing the fetal heart at this early stage. Urinary Beta-hCG determination can indicate the presence of pregnancy, but it cannot confirm viability or assess fetal cardiac activity. Per vaginal examination of uterine size corresponding to 6 weeks gestation is not a reliable method for diagnosing a viable pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
