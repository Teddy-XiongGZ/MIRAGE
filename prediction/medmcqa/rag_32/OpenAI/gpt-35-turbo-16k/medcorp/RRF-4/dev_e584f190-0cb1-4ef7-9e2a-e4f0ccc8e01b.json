    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cranial nerve is not involved in olfaction, we need to identify the cranial nerves that are involved in olfaction. According to the documents, the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) is responsible for the sense of smell. Therefore, the cranial nerve that is not involved in olfaction would be any cranial nerve other than the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I). Let's go through the potential choices:\\n\\nA. Glossopharyngeal: The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is not involved in olfaction.\\nB. Vagus: The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is not involved in olfaction.\\nC. Hypoglossal: The hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) is not involved in olfaction.\\nD. Trigeminal: The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) is not involved in olfaction.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the cranial nerve that is not involved in olfaction is the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
