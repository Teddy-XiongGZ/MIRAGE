    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's husband has a rash consistent with herpes zoster (shingles), which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The patient is pregnant and has been exposed to the virus. The next step in management would be to administer varicella immunoglobulin to the patient to provide passive immunity and reduce the risk of transmission to the fetus.
