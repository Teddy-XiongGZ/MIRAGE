    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the component that sensitizes bacteria and viruses to UV irradiation is nucleic acids. Document [0] mentions that the combined application of riboflavin (RB) and UV light enhances damage to the guanine bases in DNA. Document [2] states that UV rays can damage the DNA of viruses by creating nucleic acid dimers. Document [7] also mentions that UV-LED irradiation targets different viral components depending on the peak wavelength, and UV-LEDs at 260 nm and 280 nm induce the formation of viral DNA photoproducts. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Nucleic acids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
