    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Excess plasma levels of lignocaine can cause cardiovascular collapse due to myocardial depression. According to the documents, lignocaine toxicity can result in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects. CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations, while additional cardiovascular effects are present at higher concentrations. Excessive quantities of lignocaine can lead to CNS excitation, followed by depression, and cardiovascular effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and even cardiac arrest. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Myocardial depression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
