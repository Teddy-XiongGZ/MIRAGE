    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The effect of doubling the length of a spring can be determined by considering Hooke's law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is linearly proportional to its displacement. When the length of a spring is doubled, its displacement also doubles. Therefore, according to Hooke's law, the force exerted by the spring will also double. Since the effect is directly proportional to the force, the effect of doubling the length of a spring is also doubled.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Doubled\"}"
