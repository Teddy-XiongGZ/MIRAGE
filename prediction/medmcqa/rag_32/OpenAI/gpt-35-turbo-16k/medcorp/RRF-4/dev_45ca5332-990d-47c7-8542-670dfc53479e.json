    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the property of amalgam that makes it undesirable to bevel occlusal margins of an amalgam cavity preparation, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [5] states that the technique of overpacking amalgam produces a greater number of acceptable amalgam margins at the cavosurface margin compared to carving the amalgam to the cavosurface margin. This suggests that amalgam does not flow easily and adapt well to the cavosurface margin. Additionally, Document [16] mentions that plastic deformation or creep occurs in amalgam when subjected to intra-oral stresses such as chewing or grinding. Creep causes the amalgam to flow and protrude from the margin of the cavity, forming unsupported edges. This indicates that amalgam is not highly flowable. Based on this information, we can conclude that the property of amalgam that makes it undesirable to bevel occlusal margins is its lack of flowability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
