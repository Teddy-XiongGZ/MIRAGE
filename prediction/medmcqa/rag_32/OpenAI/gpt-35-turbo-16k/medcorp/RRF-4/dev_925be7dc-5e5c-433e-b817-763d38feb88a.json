    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are cells that display antigens bound by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on their surface. They are involved in antigen presentation to T cells. From the provided documents, we can gather that professional APCs include macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells. M-cells are not mentioned in any of the documents. Langerhans cells are a type of dendritic cell, so they are considered professional APCs. Thymocytes are immature T cells and not APCs. Therefore, the correct answer is A. M-cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
