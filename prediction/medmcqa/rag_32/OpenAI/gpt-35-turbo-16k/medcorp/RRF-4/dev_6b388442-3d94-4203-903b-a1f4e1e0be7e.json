    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reline and rebase procedures for complete dentures are typically indicated when the fit of the denture is diminished due to progressive alveolar bone reduction. According to Document [2], relining is resurfacing the tissue side of a denture with a new material to fill the space between the original denture contour and the altered tissue contour. Rebasing, on the other hand, is resurfacing the fitting surface of a denture by replacing the entire denture base with new material to fill the space between the original denture contour and the altered tissue contour. Therefore, for a loose complete denture, both relining and rebasing can be done when there is excessive alveolar bone loss, which causes the fit of the denture to be diminished.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
