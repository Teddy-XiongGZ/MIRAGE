    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the method of increasing attached gingiva, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that the apically positioned flap, free gingival graft, and subepithelial connective tissue graft are the most common surgical procedures used for augmenting the zone of attached gingiva effectively and predictably. Document [5] also mentions the modified apically repositioned flap (MARF) technique as a predictable surgical technique for increasing the zone of attached gingiva.
