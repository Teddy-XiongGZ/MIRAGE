    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In postductal coarctation of the aorta, the narrowing occurs distal to the insertion of the ductus arteriosus. This type is most common in adults and is associated with notching of the ribs, hypertension in the upper extremities, and weak pulses in the lower extremities. Collateral circulation plays a significant role in providing blood flow to the lower extremities. According to the documents, the collateral circulation in postductal coarctation of the aorta is primarily through the subclavian arteries and the internal thoracic artery, which then goes to the anterior intercostal artery, posterior intercostal artery, and finally into the descending thoracic aorta. The dilation of the intercostal arteries may result in rib notching on chest x-ray. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Intercostal arteries and superior epigastric artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
