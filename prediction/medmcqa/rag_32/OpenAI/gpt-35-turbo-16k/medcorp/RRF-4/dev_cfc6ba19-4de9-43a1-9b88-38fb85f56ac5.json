    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the unique characteristic of attached gingiva in children, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that the width of attached and keratinized gingiva increases with the child's development, except during the period of tooth replacement. Document [3] states that the width of attached gingiva in newly erupted permanent teeth is narrower than in the corresponding primary teeth. Document [9] also mentions that during the early years after eruption of permanent teeth, there is an increase in the width of attached gingiva without occlusal migration of the marginal gingiva. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that the unique characteristic of attached gingiva in children is that the width of attached gingiva increases with age, except during the period of tooth replacement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
