    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dent disease is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure. Fanconi syndrome is a consequence of decreased water and solute resorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Therefore, it is expected that a male child with Dent disease and Fanconi syndrome would have hypercalciuria, proteinuria, and nephrocalcinosis. However, the presentation of Dent disease is not typically seen in the father, as it is an X-linked recessive disorder. Rickets is not a characteristic feature of Dent disease. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Similar presentation in father.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
