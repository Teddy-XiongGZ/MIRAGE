    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the incidence of extra canal in mandibular 1st molar, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions the presence of a third canal in the mesial root of mandibular molars, while Document [2] discusses the incidence of middle mesial (MM) canals in mandibular first molars. Document [3] provides information on the root and canal morphology of mandibular first molars, including the incidence of three roots and four canals. Document [6] also discusses the root form and canal morphology of mandibular first molars. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that the incidence of extra canal in mandibular 1st molar is not mentioned specifically. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact incidence of extra canal in mandibular 1st molar from the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
