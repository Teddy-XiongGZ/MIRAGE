    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the laboratory diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis. To determine the answer, we need to review the relevant documents that discuss the laboratory tests used for diagnosing alcoholic hepatitis. Document [11] states that the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis can be made based on clinical and laboratory findings. Document [10] mentions that in people with alcoholic hepatitis, the serum AST to ALT ratio is greater than 2:1. Document [15] states that measures of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may provide evidence of altered hepatic activity in alcoholic patients. Document [21] mentions that serum markers of chronic alcohol abuse, including AST, ALT, GGT, LDH, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), can be used to differentiate between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcoholic hepatitis. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. AST.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
