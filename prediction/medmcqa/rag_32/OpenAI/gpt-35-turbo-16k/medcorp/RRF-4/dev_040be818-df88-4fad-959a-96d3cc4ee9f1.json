    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, streptococci, specifically Streptococcus mutans, are known to contribute to caries development by producing acid during metabolism. This acid production by S. mutans is essential in the adherence process and leads to the demineralization of tooth enamel, making it vulnerable to decay. While streptococci also produce extracellular polysaccharides, this is not directly related to their role in caries development. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Produce acid during metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
