    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the binding of eukaryotic mRNA to ribosomes is facilitated by the 5' cap structure. Document [2] states that ribosome recruitment in eukaryotes happens when eukaryote initiation factors elF4F and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) recognize the 5' capped mRNA and recruit the 43S ribosome complex at that location. Additionally, Document [10] mentions that the initiation factors eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G in the eIF4F complex recognize and bind the cap structure of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs, facilitating ribosome binding. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Capping.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
