    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the patient with tubercular meningitis has experienced a deterioration in sensorium after 1 month of regular intake of drugs. The priority in this situation is to evaluate for any emergent complications or causes of the deterioration. The most important investigation in this case would be a CT scan of the brain (option B) to assess for any acute changes such as hydrocephalus or tuberculomas. MRI (option A) may also be helpful, but it is not the most urgent investigation in this acute setting. CSF examination (option C) is important for the diagnosis and management of tubercular meningitis, but it may not provide immediate information about the cause of the deterioration. Liver function tests (option D) are not directly related to the acute deterioration in sensorium and would not be the most urgent investigation in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
