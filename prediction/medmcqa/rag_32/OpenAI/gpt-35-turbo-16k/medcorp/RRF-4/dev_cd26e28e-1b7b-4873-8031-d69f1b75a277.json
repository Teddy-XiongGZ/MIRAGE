    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The baby is born to a mother with chronic hepatitis B infection. The mother is positive for HBsAg but negative for HBeAg. The most appropriate treatment for the baby in this case is both active and passive immunization soon after birth. This is because the baby is at risk of vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from the mother. Active immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine stimulates the baby's immune system to produce protective antibodies against HBV. Passive immunization with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) provides immediate protection by providing pre-formed antibodies against HBV. By combining active and passive immunization, the baby has the best chance of preventing HBV infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
