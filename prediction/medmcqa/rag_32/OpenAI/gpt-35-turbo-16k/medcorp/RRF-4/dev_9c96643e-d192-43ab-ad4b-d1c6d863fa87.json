    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protein precipitation can be achieved by altering the solvation potential of the solvent, either by adding a reagent or changing the pH. Trichloroacetic acid, acetyl alcohol and acetone, and adjusting pH to other than the isoelectric point are all methods that can be used for protein precipitation. However, salts of heavy metals are not typically used for protein precipitation. Therefore, the answer is D. Salts of heavy metals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
