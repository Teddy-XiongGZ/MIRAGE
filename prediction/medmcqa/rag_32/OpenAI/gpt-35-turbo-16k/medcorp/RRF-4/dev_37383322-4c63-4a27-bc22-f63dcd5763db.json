    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the arrangement of the layers of the epidermis from the surface to the deep layer. From the given documents, we can gather that the layers of the epidermis are arranged as follows: stratum corneum (corneocytes), stratum granulosum (no mention of Merkel cells, melanocytes, or Langerhans cells), stratum spinosum (Langerhans cells), and stratum basale (Merkel cells and melanocytes). Therefore, the correct arrangement is corneocytes > Langerhans cells > melanocytes > Merkel cells. The answer choice that matches this arrangement is option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
