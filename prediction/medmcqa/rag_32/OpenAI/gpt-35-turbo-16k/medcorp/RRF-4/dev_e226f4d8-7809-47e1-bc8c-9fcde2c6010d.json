    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about phenotype, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [23] states that the phenotype is the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism, including its morphology, development, biochemical and physiological properties, behavior, and the products of behavior. This indicates that the phenotype is the appearance and observable traits of an individual. Document [12] mentions that the phenotype is the end result of both the genetic and environmental factors, further supporting the idea that the phenotype is influenced by genotype. Document [20] explains that the genotype-phenotype distinction was proposed to differentiate between an organism's heredity (genotype) and what that heredity produces (phenotype). This confirms that the phenotype is not the genetic sequence of an individual. Therefore, the statement that is not true about phenotype is C. It is not the genetic sequence of an individual.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
