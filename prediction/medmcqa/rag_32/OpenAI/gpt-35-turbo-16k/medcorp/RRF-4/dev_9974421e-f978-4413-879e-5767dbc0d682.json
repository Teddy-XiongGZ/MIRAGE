    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information can be found in Document [0] and Document [11]. According to Document [0], a lingual bar should be positioned high enough to not irritate the lower movable tissue but low enough to allow for a substantial quantity of material to be used to ensure stiffness. At least 7mm of space is usually required. This suggests that a lingual bar is used when there is sufficient space and the lingual sulcus is not deep. On the other hand, Document [11] mentions that a lingual bar has a pear-shaped cross section tapering towards the gingival boundary and sits on the soft tissue posteriorly to the dentition. This indicates that a lingual bar is used when the lingual sulcus is shallow. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Lingual sulcus is shallow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
