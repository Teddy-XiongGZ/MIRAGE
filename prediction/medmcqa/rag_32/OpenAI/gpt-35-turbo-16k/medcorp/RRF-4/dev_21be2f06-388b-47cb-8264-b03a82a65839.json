    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Long face syndrome is characterized by increased lower facial height. To determine the position of the palatal plane, we need to consider the relationship between the maxilla and the mandible. In long face syndrome, there is excessive vertical growth of the maxilla, which can result in a downward and backward rotation of the mandible. This rotation of the mandible will cause the palatal plane to be posteriorly downward.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Posteriorly downward\"}"
