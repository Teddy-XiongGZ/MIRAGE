    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystocele, enterocele, and urethral descent are all types of pelvic organ prolapse. Prolapse occurs when the fibromuscular supports of the pelvic organs fail. The perineal body, which is located between the anus and the vaginal opening, plays a crucial role in supporting the pelvic organs. Therefore, injury to the perineal body can lead to prolapse. The perineal body is primarily composed of the bulbospongiosus muscle, which is responsible for maintaining the position of the urethra and supporting the pelvic floor. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Bulbospongiosus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
