    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is common to both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that polycarboxylate cement is based on poly(acrylic) acid as the liquid component. Document [29] mentions that zinc polycarboxylate cement uses a liquid containing polyacrylic acid. Therefore, both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement have polyacrylic acid as the liquid component. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Polyacrylic acid is liquid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
