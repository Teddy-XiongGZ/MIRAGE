    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which type of anchorage is not being applied here, we need to understand the different types of anchorage. According to the documents, anchorage can be classified based on the number of teeth (simple/primary, compound, reinforced, reciprocal, stationary), based on implant (direct anchorage, indirect anchorage), and based on bone. None of the given choices (A. Reciprocal, B. Stationary, C. Intramaxillary, D. Intraoral) directly correspond to the types of anchorage mentioned in the documents. Therefore, we cannot determine the type of anchorage that is not being applied here based on the given choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
