    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Galeazzi's fracture dislocation is characterized by a fracture of the radius shaft along with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The interosseous membrane, which connects the radius and ulna, is often torn in this injury. Additionally, the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), which is a ligamentous structure that stabilizes the DRUJ, may also be torn. Based on the information provided in the documents, the correct answer is C. Interosseous membrane tear with triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear and ulnar shaft fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
