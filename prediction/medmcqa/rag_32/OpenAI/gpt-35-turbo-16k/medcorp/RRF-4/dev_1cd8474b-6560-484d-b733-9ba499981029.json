    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating substances, generally including materials such as kaolinite, in a kiln to temperatures between . The strength, and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of pottery, arises mainly from vitrification and formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures. Porcelain can be divided into three main categories: hard-paste, soft-paste, and bone china. The category that an object belongs to depends on the composition of the paste used to make the body of the porcelain object and the firing conditions. Based on this information, we can determine that silica and feldspar are present in porcelain, as they are part of the composition. Calcium carbonate is not mentioned in the relevant documents as a component of porcelain. Amorphous material is not specifically mentioned, but it is possible that it could be present in the form of the glassy matrix that forms during the firing process. Therefore, the answer is C. Calcium carbonate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
