    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine for which condition pulpectomy should not be performed, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [6] states that pulpectomy is performed on primary teeth with extensive decay and involving pulp in the root canal. Document [8] mentions that pulpectomy is the last means to preserve primary teeth with pulpitis or pulp necrosis. Document [25] suggests that pulpectomies of deciduous teeth with severe pulpal necrosis should be considered as a possible treatment plan. Based on this information, we can conclude that pulpectomy is generally performed for primary teeth with pulpitis, pulp necrosis, or severe pulpal necrosis. Therefore, the condition for which pulpectomy should not be performed is primary teeth without pulp, which is the case for pulpless primary teeth next to the line of a palatal cleft. Hence, the answer is D. Pulpless primary teeth next to the line of a palatal cleft.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
