    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cysts associated with vital teeth are those that involve teeth with pulp vitality. From the provided documents, we can gather information about different types of cysts and their association with vital teeth. The dentigerous cyst is mentioned in multiple documents and is known to be associated with unerupted teeth. In Document [0], it is stated that dentigerous cysts can replace the tooth with which they are associated or cause resorption of adjacent tooth roots. In Document [2], it is mentioned that radicular cysts are associated with the roots of non-vital teeth. Therefore, dentigerous cysts are associated with vital teeth, while radicular cysts are associated with non-vital teeth. OKC (odontogenic keratocyst) is not specifically mentioned in relation to vital teeth. Globulomaxillary cyst and lateral periodontal cyst are mentioned in Document [28], but there is no information about their association with vital teeth. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. 'B' & 'C', which includes dentigerous cysts and radicular cysts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
