    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how much drug will remain after 6 hours, we need to calculate the elimination rate constant (k) using the given information. The elimination rate constant (k) can be calculated using the formula: k = (0.693 / t1/2), where t1/2 is the half-life of the drug. Since the drug follows first-order kinetics, we can use the formula: t1/2 = (0.693 / k). Once we have the value of k, we can use the formula: remaining drug = initial drug * e^(-kt), where t is the time in hours. Plugging in the values, we can calculate the remaining drug after 6 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
