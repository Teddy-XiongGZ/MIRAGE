    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the height of contour of the maxillary canine in comparison to the maxillary central incisor, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] provides information about the maxillary central incisor, stating that the diameter of the crown mesiodistally is greater than the length cervicoincisally, which makes the tooth appear wider rather than taller from a labial viewpoint. Document [8] provides information about the maxillary canine, stating that it is notably narrower mesiodistally than the maxillary central incisor. Based on this information, we can conclude that the height of contour of the maxillary canine is less than that of the maxillary central incisor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Less\"}"
