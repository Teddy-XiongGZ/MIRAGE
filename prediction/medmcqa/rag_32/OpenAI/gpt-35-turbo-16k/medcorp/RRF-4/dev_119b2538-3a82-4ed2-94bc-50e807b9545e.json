    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the modulus of elasticity of the cement that is best to support under a complex amalgam restoration, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the fracture strength of amalgam restorations varied with the type of base, and that zinc phosphate cement is equal to no base and superior to zinc phosphate cement plus Dycal, which is equal to Dycal. Document [2] mentions that the modulus of elasticity of composites most likely to be used in posterior teeth is approximately one third of the modulus of elasticity of amalgam. Document [3] states that modulus elasticity of cement plays an important role in affecting the fracture strength of the amalgam restored tooth. From the point of mechanical property, zinc phosphate is one of the best dental cements. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the cement with the best modulus of elasticity to support under a complex amalgam restoration is zinc phosphate cement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
