    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which enzyme is required to induce the formation of a plasma clot in pathogenic staphylococci, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] states that Staphylococcus aureus secretes coagulases, polypeptides that bind to and activate prothrombin, thereby converting fibrinogen to fibrin and promoting the clotting of plasma or blood. Coagulases are the enzymes responsible for inducing clot formation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Coagulase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
