    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most commonly missing tooth, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that dental caries is the most common cause of tooth loss, followed by periodontal disease. Document [5] mentions that in the permanent dentition, third molars (wisdom teeth) are most commonly absent. However, we need to exclude third molars from consideration, as stated in Document [7]. Document [7] also states that the most commonly congenitally missing permanent teeth, excluding third molars, are mandibular second premolars, maxillary lateral incisors, and occasionally maxillary second premolars. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most commonly missing tooth is the maxillary lateral incisor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
