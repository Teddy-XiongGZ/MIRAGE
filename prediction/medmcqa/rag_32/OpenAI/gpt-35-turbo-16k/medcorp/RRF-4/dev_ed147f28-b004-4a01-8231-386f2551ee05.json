    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given cephalometric measurements. ANB angle is a commonly used measurement to assess the sagittal relationship between the maxilla and the mandible. A negative ANB angle indicates a Class III relationship, where the mandible is positioned more anteriorly than the maxilla. A facial angle of 98\u00b0 is within the normal range. Based on these measurements, the correct answer is C. True Class III malocclusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
