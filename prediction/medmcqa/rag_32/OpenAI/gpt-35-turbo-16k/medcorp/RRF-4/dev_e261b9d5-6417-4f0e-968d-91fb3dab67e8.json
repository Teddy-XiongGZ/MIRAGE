    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Traumatic occlusal forces can cause changes in the alveolar bone. According to Document [1], bone is removed from areas where it is no longer needed and added to areas where it is needed in response to external forces, particularly occlusal forces. This suggests that there is bone resorption in areas of pressure and bone apposition in areas of tension. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Osteoblasts in areas of tension and osteoclasts in areas of pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
