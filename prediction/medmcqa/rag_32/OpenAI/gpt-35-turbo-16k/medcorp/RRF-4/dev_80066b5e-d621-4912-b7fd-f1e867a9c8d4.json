    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the nutritional management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Document [2] describes the nutritional management of CKD patients in a public outpatient clinic in Brazil. It mentions that for patients with CKD stage 3, the main dietary focus is on the control of protein intake, particularly from animal sources. For patients on stages 4 or 5 of CKD, a more complete nutritional assessment is performed, and the dietary plan focuses not only on the control of protein but also on energy supply and specific micronutrients. Document [9] recommends a protein intake of 0.6 g/kg of ideal body weight/day for CKD patients without malnutrition to halt the progression of CKD. Based on this information, the renal feed for CKD patients is likely to be low calorie low volume (choice A) to control protein intake and manage the nutritional needs of CKD patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
