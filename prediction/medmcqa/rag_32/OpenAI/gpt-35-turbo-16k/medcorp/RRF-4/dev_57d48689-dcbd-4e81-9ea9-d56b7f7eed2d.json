    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, carbon steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, and the carbon content can vary depending on the specific type of carbon steel. Document [3] states that high-carbon steel has approximately 0.6 to 1.0% carbon content, while document [8] mentions that carbon steel commonly used in knives has around 1.0% carbon. Therefore, the percentage of carbon in carbon steel hand instruments is likely to be around 1.0%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
