    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with progressive jaundice, pruritus, and clay-colored stools, which are indicative of obstructive jaundice. The CT scan shows dilated main pancreatic duct and common bile duct, suggesting a blockage in the biliary system. Given the patient's history of chronic smoking, the most likely diagnosis is Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (D). Carcinoma head of pancreas (A) and Periampullary carcinoma (B) are also possible, but Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is more likely based on the imaging findings and the patient's risk factor. Chronic pancreatitis (C) is less likely as it typically presents with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and may not cause significant biliary duct dilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
