    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Occlusal equilibration involves selectively reshaping the occlusal surfaces of teeth to achieve an optimum and mutually protected occlusion. To determine which surfaces need to be reduced, we need to analyze the available information. Document [1] states that occlusal equilibration resulted in the resolution of cervical dentin hypersensitivity, suggesting that the treatment involved reducing occlusal interferences. Document [4] mentions that the orthodontist should equilibrate the occlusion of every completed case to eliminate minute occlusal interferences. Document [5] explains that occlusal adjustment involves selectively grinding down involved cusps or restorations. Based on this information, it can be inferred that occlusal equilibration typically involves reducing occlusal interferences on both the upper and lower teeth. Therefore, the answer is D. Both AB.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
