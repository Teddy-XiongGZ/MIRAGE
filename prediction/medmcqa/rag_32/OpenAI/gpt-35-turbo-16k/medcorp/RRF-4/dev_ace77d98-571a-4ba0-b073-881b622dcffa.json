    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which bones are part of the inferior wall of the orbit, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the floor of the orbit consists of three bones: the maxillary bone, the palatine bone, and the orbital plate of the zygomatic bone. Document [19] also mentions that the floor of the orbit is formed by the orbital surface of the maxilla, the orbital surface of the zygomatic bone, and the minute orbital process of the palatine bone. Therefore, the correct answer is not mentioned in the given choices. None of the options (A, B, C, D) are part of the inferior wall of the orbit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
