    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient suddenly pulling out the endotracheal tube indicates an unplanned extubation. The first step is to assess the patient's condition and provide bag and mask ventilation to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This will help determine if the patient is able to maintain spontaneous breathing. Reintubation may be necessary if the patient is unable to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation with bag and mask ventilation. Sedation may be considered if the patient is agitated and uncooperative. Physiotherapy is not the appropriate next step in managing an unplanned extubation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
