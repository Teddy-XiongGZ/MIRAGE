    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The researcher claims that the new drug is effective in chronic hypertensives with a p-value of < 0.10. The p-value is the probability of observing an effect of the same magnitude or more extreme given that the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the null hypothesis would be that the drug is not effective. A p-value of < 0.10 means that there is a 10% chance of observing the same effect or a more extreme effect if the drug is not actually effective. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 90% of test results could have occurred by chance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
