    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the direction of force can have different effects on the bite. The documents mention forces in various contexts, such as physics, mechanics, and aerodynamics. However, none of the documents specifically address the effects of force on the bite or dental occlusion. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific effects of the direction of force on the bite based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
