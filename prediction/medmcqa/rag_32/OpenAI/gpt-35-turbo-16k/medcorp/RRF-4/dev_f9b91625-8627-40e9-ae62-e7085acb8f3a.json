    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the characteristics of porcelain denture teeth, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [5] states that porcelain teeth are more brittle than acrylic resin teeth. Document [10] mentions that ceramic denture teeth, including porcelain, have superior wear resistance compared to acrylic resin teeth. Document [27] describes that porcelain denture teeth are aesthetically and functionally superior to natural teeth and other materials. However, there is no specific information about the coefficient of thermal expansion or inter alveolar clearance. Document [3] discusses the wear mechanisms of porcelain denture teeth, but it does not compare the abrasion resistance of porcelain teeth to enamel or gold. Based on the available information, the most accurate statement is that porcelain denture teeth have a higher abrasion resistance than gold. Therefore, the answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
