    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine when the maximum strain of the parturient heart occurs, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [4] discusses the effects of the physiologic load of pregnancy on left ventricular contractility and remodeling. It states that the increase in hemodynamic load during pregnancy is associated with preservation of global pump function. However, there is a transient decrease in contractile state, which may represent an adaptation phase of the contractile elements of the myocardium to the rapid changes in loading conditions observed during the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, the maximum strain of the parturient heart occurs during the first trimester.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
