    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ganglionic transmission refers to the transmission of information between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons in autonomic ganglia. The relevant documents provide information about the neurotransmitters and receptors involved in ganglionic transmission. Document [0] mentions that synaptic transmission occurs between the preganglionic nerve terminal and the principal ganglion neuron. Document [4] states that ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine receptors (AChR) mediate fast synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Document [8] mentions that catecholamines, such as noradrenaline, can inhibit transmission through airway parasympathetic ganglia by inhibiting transmitter release. Document [14] discusses the effects of N6-2'-O dibutyryl 3',5' cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) on ganglionic transmission. Based on this information, it can be concluded that ganglionic transmission is mediated by postsynaptic nicotinic receptors, as mentioned in Document [4].\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Postsynaptic nicotinic receptors\"}"
