    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the drug used to counteract the gastric irritation produced by administration of NSAIDs. To find the answer, we need to look for information about drugs that can protect the gastric mucosa and reduce the adverse effects of NSAIDs on the gastrointestinal tract. Document [0] mentions that NSAIDs cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract by reducing the levels of protective prostaglandins. Document [7] states that medications like proton pump inhibitors and prostaglandin analogs can reduce gastric adverse effects and restore the lining of the GI tract. Document [12] mentions that the risk of peptic ulcer disease increases with NSAID use, but misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, can reduce the risk of gastric ulcers in NSAID users. Based on this information, the drug used to counteract the gastric irritation produced by administration of NSAIDs is Misoprostol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
