    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phage mediated change in C. diphtheria is due to transduction. Transduction is the process by which genetic material is transferred from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage. In the case of C. diphtheria, the tox gene, which encodes for diphtheria toxin, is carried by a lysogenic phage called corynephage beta. When the phage infects C. diphtheria, it integrates its genetic material into the bacterial chromosome, resulting in the production of diphtheria toxin. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Transduction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
