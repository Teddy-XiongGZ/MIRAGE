    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about Vibrio cholerae, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [13] states that V. cholerae is a highly motile, comma-shaped, gram-negative rod. Document [17] mentions that V. cholerae naturally lives in brackish or saltwater and attaches itself easily to the chitin-containing shells of crabs, shrimps, and other shellfish. Document [26] explains that V. cholerae is found as a free-living organism in brackish water and can survive in fresh or saltwater. Based on this information, we can conclude that statement D, \"Cannot survive in extracellular environment,\" is not true about Vibrio cholerae, as it is capable of surviving in the environment outside of a host.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
