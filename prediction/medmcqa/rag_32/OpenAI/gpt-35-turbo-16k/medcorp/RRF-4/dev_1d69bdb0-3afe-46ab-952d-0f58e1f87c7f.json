    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the force applied to cause root movement, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] discusses the optimum force theory and mentions that increasing the rotational stiffness of an appliance can result in greater control over root movement. Document [2] states that force distribution is more important than its intensity, and that diffuse distribution of forces tends to promote less root resorption. Document [4] compares different types of tooth movement and force magnitudes in rats and concludes that heavier orthodontic forces result in more root resorption. Document [7] discusses the association between applied force, achieved tooth movement, and related root resorptions, and mentions that the magnitude and type of force play a role in root resorption. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that the force applied to cause root movement should be carefully controlled and distributed to minimize root resorption. Therefore, the answer choice is D. Gentle action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
