    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, CT scanning is not always reliable for detecting nodal metastasis. The sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning for nodal metastasis vary depending on the study, but it is generally limited. The documents mention that small, clinically occult metastases are frequently overlooked on CT. Therefore, it is possible that nodal metastasis may not be seen on CT scan even if certain characteristics are present. Among the given choices, spiculated node, size more than 6 mm, and rounded node are not mentioned specifically in relation to the detection of nodal metastasis on CT scan. However, the document does mention that nodal metastases can show irregular contrast enhancement and frequently occur in parotids, superficial nodes in the neck, and in the posterior triangle. Therefore, necrotic node may be a more likely characteristic that is not seen on CT scan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
