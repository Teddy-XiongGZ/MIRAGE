    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the signs of myocardial infarction, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that chest pain is the most typical and significant symptom of myocardial infarction. Document [5] mentions Levine's sign, which is the act of holding a clenched fist to the chest. Document [9] mentions that tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular arrhythmia may be present, indicating cardiac electrical disturbances. Document [18] describes chest pain as a common symptom of acute myocardial infarction. Based on this information, we can conclude that the signs of myocardial infarction do not include 'a' wave elevation, Kussmaul's sign, or bradycardia in case of infarction of the anterior portion of the heart. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 'a' wave elevation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
