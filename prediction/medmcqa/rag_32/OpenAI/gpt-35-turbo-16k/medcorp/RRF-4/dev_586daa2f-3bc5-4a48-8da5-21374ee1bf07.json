    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, there are several studies that discuss the susceptibility of primary teeth to caries. Document [1] mentions that certain teeth and tooth sites have similar susceptibilities and can be grouped. The most susceptible group consists of six tooth surfaces: the buccal pits and occlusal fissured surfaces of the first molar teeth. Document [15] also states that pits and fissures in occlusal surfaces of first molars and pits in buccal surfaces of lower first molars are most vulnerable for developing a carious lesion. Therefore, the correct order of caries susceptibility of primary teeth is 1st molar > 2nd molar > canine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 1st molar>2nd molar>canine\"}"
