    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with progressive jaundice and elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, which suggests a cholestatic pattern of liver injury. The SGOT and SGPT levels are only slightly elevated, indicating minimal hepatocellular damage. Based on these findings, the most probable diagnosis is Dubin-Johnson syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired bilirubin excretion and elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin. Choledocholithiasis, viral hepatitis, and malignant obstructive jaundice would typically present with higher levels of SGOT and SGPT, as well as other clinical features that are not mentioned in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
