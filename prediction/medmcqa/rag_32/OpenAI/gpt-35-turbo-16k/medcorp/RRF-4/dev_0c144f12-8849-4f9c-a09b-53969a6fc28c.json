    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To test the statistical significance of the difference in heights of school children among three socio-economic groups, the most appropriate statistical test is the one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). This test is used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between them. In this case, the three socio-economic groups can be considered as independent groups, and the heights of the school children can be compared across these groups using the one-way ANOVA test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
