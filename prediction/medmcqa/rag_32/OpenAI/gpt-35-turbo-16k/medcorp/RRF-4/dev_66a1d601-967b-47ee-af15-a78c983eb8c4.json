    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the answer to the question, we need to search for information related to plaque accumulation and Glickman. Looking through the documents, we find Document [22] titled 'Bacterial colonization during de novo plaque formation.' This document describes a study where plaque accumulation was observed over a period of 4 days without oral hygiene. The study found that the mean plaque index increased from 0 to 1.6 after 4 days. Although this document does not specifically mention Glickman, it provides relevant information about plaque accumulation. Therefore, we can conclude that the maximum accumulation of plaque takes place in approximately 4 days.\", \"answer_choice\": \"4 days\"}"
