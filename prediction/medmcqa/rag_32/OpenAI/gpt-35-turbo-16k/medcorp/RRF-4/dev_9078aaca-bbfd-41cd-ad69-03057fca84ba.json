    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Duplex Doppler ultrasonography is a non-invasive diagnostic method used to assess the blood flow in the lower limb veins. The characteristics of venous blood flow in duplex Doppler can be determined by analyzing the spectral Doppler waveform. In normal venous blood flow, the waveform is typically biphasic, meaning it has two distinct phases: a forward flow phase during muscle relaxation and a reverse flow phase during muscle contraction. This biphasic waveform is a characteristic feature of venous blood flow in the lower limb. Therefore, the answer is B. Biphasic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
