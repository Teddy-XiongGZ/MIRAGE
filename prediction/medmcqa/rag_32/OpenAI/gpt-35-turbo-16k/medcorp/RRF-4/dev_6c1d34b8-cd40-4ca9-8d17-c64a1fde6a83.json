    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is characterized by the infection of the endocardium or heart valves by microbes, resulting in tissue destruction. The typical features of infective endocarditis include the presence of vegetation along the cusps of the heart valves, which are composed of fibrin, platelets, and microorganisms. Thrombus formation in the left atria can also occur as a result of the infection. Perforation of the cusps can occur due to the destructive nature of the infection. However, myocardial abscess is not a typical feature of infective endocarditis. Myocardial abscess refers to the formation of a localized collection of pus within the myocardium, which is the muscular tissue of the heart. While infective endocarditis can lead to complications such as myocardial abscess, it is not a characteristic feature of the condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
