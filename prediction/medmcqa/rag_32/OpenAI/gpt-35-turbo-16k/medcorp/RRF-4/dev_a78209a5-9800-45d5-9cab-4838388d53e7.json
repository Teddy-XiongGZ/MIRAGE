    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, cobalt-chrome alloys are known for their high resistance to corrosion. The alloys form a protective passive film composed mainly of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) on the surface, which contributes to their corrosion resistance. Therefore, the presence of chrome in cobalt-chrome casting is responsible for its resistance to corrosion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
