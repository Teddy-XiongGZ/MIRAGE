    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is least likely to cause infective endocarditis, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [4] states that Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of infective endocarditis, accounting for about 31% of cases. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that other species of Staphylococcus, such as Staphylococcus albus, may also have the potential to cause infective endocarditis. Document [4] also mentions that Streptococcus viridans and Enterococci are the second and third most common organisms responsible for infective endocarditis. Streptococcus faecalis is a species of Enterococcus, so it is likely to have the potential to cause infective endocarditis. Salmonella typhi is a species of Salmonella, which is not commonly associated with infective endocarditis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that is not commonly associated with infective endocarditis either. Based on this information, the least likely organism to cause infective endocarditis among the options provided is Salmonella typhi.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
