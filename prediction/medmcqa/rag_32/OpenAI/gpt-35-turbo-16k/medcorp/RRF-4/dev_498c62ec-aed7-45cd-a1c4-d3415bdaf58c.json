    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the advantage of glass ionomer cement reinforced with metal particles is likely to be increased resistance to abrasion. Document [5] states that the addition of metal to glass-ionomer cements can markedly increase the strength of the materials. Document [15] also mentions that adding metal particles to glass ionomer powder increased flexural strength. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increased resistance to abrasion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
