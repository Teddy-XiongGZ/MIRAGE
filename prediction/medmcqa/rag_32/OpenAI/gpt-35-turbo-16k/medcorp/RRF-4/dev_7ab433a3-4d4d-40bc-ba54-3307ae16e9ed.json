    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Occlusal adjustment refers to the process of modifying the occlusal surfaces of teeth to achieve a harmonious occlusion. It involves factors such as compensating curve, cusp height, incisal guidance, and postural position. To determine which factor does not affect occlusal adjustment, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Compensating curve: Document [26] mentions Trapozzano's concept, which eliminates the plane of orientation and compensating curves from the factors of occlusion. However, Document [27] discusses the importance of considering functional aspects, including compensating curves, in an ideal occlusion. Therefore, compensating curve is a factor that can affect occlusal adjustment.\\n\\nB. Cusp height: Document [26] mentions cusp height inclinations as one of the factors required to establish a balanced occlusion. Additionally, Document [27] discusses the importance of occlusal guidance on the functioning side, which involves the cusp height. Therefore, cusp height is a factor that can affect occlusal adjustment.\\n\\nC. Incisal guidance: Document [27] mentions incisal guidance as one of the characteristics of an ideal occlusion. It also discusses the freedom for the mandible to move from centric relation to centric occlusion and slightly anterior to centric occlusion without interference. This movement involves the incisal guidance. Therefore, incisal guidance is a factor that can affect occlusal adjustment.\\n\\nD. Postural position: Postural position refers to the position of the mandible at rest. While the documents provide information about occlusal adjustment and its effects on occlusion-related disorders, there is no specific mention of postural position in relation to occlusal adjustment. Therefore, postural position is the factor that does not affect occlusal adjustment.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the answer is D. Postural position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
