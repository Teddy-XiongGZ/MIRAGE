    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which vessel is not ligated in case of epistaxis control, we need to review the relevant documents for information on the surgical management of epistaxis. Document [0] mentions endoscopic transnasal sphenopalatine artery ligation as a surgical technique for the management of epistaxis. Document [2] states that if arterial ligation is contemplated and the site of bleeding has not been identified, it is reasonable to ligate the external carotid or maxillary artery. Document [3] mentions that surgical treatment by electrocoagulation of the bleeding site under general anesthesia is an effective intervention in 95% of cases, and if these measures have been proven to be ineffective, clipping of the ipsilateral anterior and posterior ethmoid- and/or the maxillary artery provides a treatment option. Document [5] discusses transantral maxillary artery ligation for severe idiopathic epistaxis. Document [6] states that early arterial ligation is the treatment of choice in severe epistaxis. Document [8] mentions that in severe cases with persistent and recurrent bleeding not controlled with conservative measures, surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization are considered as a next step. Document [10] discusses the management of intractable spontaneous epistaxis and mentions transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation and arterial embolization as treatment options. Document [12] describes endoscopic transseptal sphenopalatine artery ligation for intractable posterior epistaxis. Document [15] mentions internal maxillary artery ligation as a treatment option for epistaxis. Document [17] reports a case of severe arterial epistaxis treated by transantral ligation of the maxillary artery. Document [19] discusses the treatment of epistaxis and mentions surgical arterial ligation as an option. Based on the information from these documents, it can be concluded that the vessel not ligated in case of epistaxis control is the internal carotid artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Internal carotid artery\"}"
