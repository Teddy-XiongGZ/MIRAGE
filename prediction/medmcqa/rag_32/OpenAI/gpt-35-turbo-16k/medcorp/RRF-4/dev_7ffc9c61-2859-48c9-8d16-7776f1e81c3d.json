    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"COPD is characterized by airflow limitation, which is measured by spirometry. The key spirometry findings in COPD include decreased FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and decreased FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio. This indicates airflow obstruction. Additionally, COPD is associated with increased RV (residual volume), which is the volume of air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. However, MEFR (maximal expiratory flow rate) is not typically used to diagnose or assess COPD. Diffusion capacity, which measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gases, is often decreased in COPD due to destruction of the alveoli. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Decreased diffusion capacity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
