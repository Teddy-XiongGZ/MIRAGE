    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the answer to the question, we need to search for information about the plastic carrier size in carrier-based gutta-percha. Looking through the relevant documents, we can find information about the different materials used for the carrier, such as polyethylene (PE), hydroxyapatite (HA), and strontium oxide (SrO) in Document [1]. However, there is no specific mention of the plastic carrier size in the documents. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact material used for the plastic carrier size of 40-90 in carrier-based gutta-percha. \", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
