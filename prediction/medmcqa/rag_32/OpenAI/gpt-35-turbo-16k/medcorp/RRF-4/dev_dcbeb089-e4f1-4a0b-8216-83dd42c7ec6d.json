    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the main crystalline component of calculus, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] states that calculus is composed primarily of calcium phosphate crystals organized into four principal mineral phases: whitlockite, hydroxyapatite, octacalcium phosphate, and brushite. Therefore, the main crystalline component of calculus can be one of these four options. To confirm the main component, we need to refer to other documents that provide more specific information about the composition of calculus. Document [6] mentions that dental calculus from humans consists principally of the calcite form of calcium carbonate mixed with small amounts of apatite, but it does not mention the other mineral phases. Document [8] states that the crystalline components of human dental calculus include hydroxyapatite and octacalcium phosphate, among others. Document [12] also mentions the presence of hydroxyapatite, octacalcium phosphate, and brushite in dental calculus. Based on this information, we can conclude that the main crystalline component of calculus is hydroxyapatite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hydroxyapatite\"}"
