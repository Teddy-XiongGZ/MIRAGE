    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the termination point of root canal procedures. Document [0] states that the therapeutic procedures should not extend beyond the apical foramen. Document [3] compares the ability of radiographic and electronic methods to determine the location of the apical constriction. Document [6] mentions that root canals should be terminated short of the radiographic root apex. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the termination point of root canal procedures is the apical foramen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
