    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, ultrashort-acting barbiturates are commonly used for anesthesia due to their extremely short duration of action. Looking at the potential choices, meprobamate is not an ultrashort-acting barbiturate. Pentobarbitone is a short-acting barbiturate, not ultrashort-acting. Phenobarbitone is a long-acting barbiturate, not ultrashort-acting. Thiopentone, on the other hand, is an ultrashort-acting barbiturate commonly used for anesthesia.
