    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which option is not used in the management of overdosage of Fibrinolytics, we need to review the relevant documents for information on the management of overdosage. Document [2] mentions that adverse effects of fibrinolytic agents include bleeding, hypotension, allergic reactions, angioedema, anaphylactic shock, and reperfusion arrhythmias. Document [14] discusses the management of bleeding in vascular surgery and mentions that fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates administration are recommended during massive transfusion. Document [19] discusses the use of fibrinogen concentrates in the management of perioperative bleeding. Document [31] mentions that supportive measures should be instituted, including volume correction and blood factor transfusion, in the management of bleeding complications in a patient with ongoing fibrinolytic therapy. Based on this information, it can be concluded that FFP (Fresh Frozen Plasma) is used in the management of bleeding complications in patients with ongoing fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, the answer is D. FFP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
