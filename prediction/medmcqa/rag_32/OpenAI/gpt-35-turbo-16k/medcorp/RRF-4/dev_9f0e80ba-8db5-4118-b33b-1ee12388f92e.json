    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information for answering this question can be found in Document [25] (Title: Grind). According to the document, the edge angle is measured between a line lying in the plane of one of the edge's faces and a second line intersecting the back's center contour, both lines lying in the same plane normal to the edge. Therefore, the edge angle is between the rake face and the radial line. Hence, the correct answer is A. Rake face and radial line.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
