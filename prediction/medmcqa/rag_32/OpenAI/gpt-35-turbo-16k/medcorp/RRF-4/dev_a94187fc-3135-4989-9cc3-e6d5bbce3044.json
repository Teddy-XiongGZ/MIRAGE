    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the appropriate method for checking bone healing in a 5-year-old child with a mandibular fracture on a follow-up recall after 2 months, we can refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] provides information on radiographic changes during bone healing after mandibular fractures. According to this document, serial radiographs were used to evaluate the radiographic features of healing at different time intervals. Document [1] discusses the use of computed tomography (CT) examination for follow-up evaluation of mandibular fractures. Document [13] mentions the use of resorbable plate fixation in association with dental arch stabilization for the treatment of mandibular fractures in children. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that radiographic evaluation, such as an OPG or CT scan, would be appropriate to check the bone healing in a 5-year-old child with a mandibular fracture after 2 months. Therefore, the answer choice is B. NCCT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
