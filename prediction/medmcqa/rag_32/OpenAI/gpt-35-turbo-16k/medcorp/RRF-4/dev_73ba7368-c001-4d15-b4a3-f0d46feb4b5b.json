    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Loss of flexion in the interphalangeal joint of the thumb in a supracondylar fracture is due to involvement of the anterior interosseous nerve. According to Document [1], anterior interosseous nerve syndrome, which affects only the motor branch of the median nerve, is characterized by paralysis of the flexor pollicis longus, the flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger, and the pronator quadratus, resulting in weakness of flexion of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb and the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger without sensory loss.
