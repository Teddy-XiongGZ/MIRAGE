    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the treatment plan for a parasymphysial fracture in a 55-year-old man, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] provides information on the treatment of bilateral condylar fractures, but it does not specifically mention parasymphysial fractures. Document [3] mentions that if either of the condyles is displaced, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is the most satisfactory method of treatment. Document [9] describes the use of open cap splint with circummandibular wiring as a treatment modality for pediatric mandibular parasymphysis/symphysis fractures. Document [21] compares circummandibular wiring with resorbable bone plates in pediatric mandibular fractures. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the treatment plan for a parasymphysial fracture in a 55-year-old man would likely involve open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or the use of an open cap splint with circummandibular wiring. However, the specific duration of immobilization (IMF) or the need for a compression plate or reconstruction plate cannot be determined from the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
