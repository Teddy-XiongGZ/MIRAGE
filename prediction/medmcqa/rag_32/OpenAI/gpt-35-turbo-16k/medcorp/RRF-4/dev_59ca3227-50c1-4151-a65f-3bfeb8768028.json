    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the estimates of the additional energy requirements during pregnancy vary. Document [0] states that the traditional estimates are approximately 300 calories per day or 80,000 calories for a full-term pregnancy. However, these estimates have been challenged as being excessive, especially for non-Western populations. Document [1] recommends an additional 340 calories per day during the second trimester and 450 extra calories per day in the third trimester. Document [2] suggests adding 100 to 300 kcal/d to the estimated nonpregnant energy requirements in the first trimester, 340 kcal/d in the second trimester, and 452 kcal/d in the third trimester. Document [3] recommends an additional 100-300 kcal/day. Document [9] states that pregnant women's energy intakes remain stable throughout trimesters. Considering all these sources, it is clear that the energy requirements during pregnancy vary and there is no consensus on a specific number. However, the most common estimate mentioned is around 300 calories per day. Therefore, the answer is A. 300.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
