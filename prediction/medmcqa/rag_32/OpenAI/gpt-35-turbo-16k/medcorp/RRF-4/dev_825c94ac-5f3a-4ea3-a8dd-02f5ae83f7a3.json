    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cryosurgery is a surgical technique that employs freezing to destroy undesirable tissue. The mechanism by which a cryogen destroys cells is complex. The formation of a hemispherical iceball composed of thermogradients, each of which maintains a temperature proportional to its distance from the application point, initiates the cryoinjury. The freezing process induces coagulation necrosis and is confined to the tissues within the region of the probe application and the ice ball. The degree and extent of tissue destruction depend largely on the size of the ice ball and the temperatures within it. Therefore, cell death occurs when the temperature falls below a certain threshold. However, it is important to note that cryosurgery is not limited to just freezing the cells, as it also involves a slow thawing process. General anesthesia may or may not be required depending on the specific case and the location of the surgery. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
