    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To test the statistical significance of the difference in heights of school children, we need to compare the heights of different groups. Since we are comparing the heights of different groups, the appropriate statistical test to use is ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). ANOVA allows us to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. In this case, we would compare the heights of different groups of school children to see if there is a significant difference in their heights.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. ANOVA\"}"
