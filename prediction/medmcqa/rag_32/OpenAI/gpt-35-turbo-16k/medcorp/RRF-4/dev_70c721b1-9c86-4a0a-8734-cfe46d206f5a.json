    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Filtration process in radiography is used to remove the portion of long wavelength photons. It is done to improve the quality of the radiograph by reducing the amount of scattered radiation and increasing the contrast of the image. Filtration helps to remove the low-energy photons that contribute to image blur and reduce the overall image quality. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Remove the portion of long wavelength photons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
