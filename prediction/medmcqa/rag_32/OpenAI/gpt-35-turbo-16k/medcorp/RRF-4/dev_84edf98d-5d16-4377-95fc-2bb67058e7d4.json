    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, the necrotising reaction that occurs at the site of the second injection of horse serum in a rabbit is most likely the Arthus phenomenon. The Arthus phenomenon is characterized by a local inflammatory reaction, including hemorrhage and necrosis, at the site of antigen injection in a sensitized individual. This reaction occurs when there is a localized immune complex formation between pre-existing antibodies and the injected antigen. In this case, the rabbit has been sensitized by the initial intravenous injection of horse serum, and the subsequent intradermal injection of horse serum leads to the development of a necrotising reaction at the injection site, which is consistent with the characteristics of the Arthus phenomenon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Arthus phenomenon\"}"
