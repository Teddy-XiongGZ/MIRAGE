    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If during an application of an orthodontic force, the level declines to zero between activations, then the force duration is classified as intermittent force. This means that the force is applied for a certain period of time and then completely released before being applied again. Continuous force refers to a force that is constantly applied without any breaks. Interrupted force refers to a force that is temporarily stopped and then resumed. Differential force refers to a force that varies in magnitude or direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Intermittent force\"}"
