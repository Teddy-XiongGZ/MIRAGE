    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options is an example of placebo, we need to understand what placebo means. Placebo refers to a treatment or intervention that has no intrinsic therapeutic value but is administered as if it were a therapy. It is used in clinical trials as a control group to evaluate the effects of a new treatment. Based on this definition, we can eliminate options B (Physiotherapy) and D (Cognitive behavioral therapy) as they are active treatments with known therapeutic effects. Option A (Herbal medication with no known effect) could be a placebo if it is administered as if it were an active medication. Option C (Sham surgery) is a classic example of placebo, where a surgical procedure is performed without any actual therapeutic intervention. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Sham surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
