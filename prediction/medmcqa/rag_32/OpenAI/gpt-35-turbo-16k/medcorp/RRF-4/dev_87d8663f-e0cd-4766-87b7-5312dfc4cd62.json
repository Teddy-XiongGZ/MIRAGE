    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If the coefficient of thermal expansion of ceramic is much lower than that of metal, it means that the ceramic will contract more than the metal when exposed to temperature changes. This can result in compressive stresses in the ceramic and tensile stresses in the metal. These stresses can lead to cohesive failure of the ceramic, where the ceramic material itself fractures or cracks. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Cohesive failure of ceramic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
