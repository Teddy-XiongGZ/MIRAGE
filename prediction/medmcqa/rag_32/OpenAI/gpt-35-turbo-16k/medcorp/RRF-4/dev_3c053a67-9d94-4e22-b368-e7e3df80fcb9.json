    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Direct pulp capping is a procedure used to preserve tooth vitality by placing a protective dressing directly over an exposed pulp. To determine when direct pulp capping is not done, we need to consider the indications and contraindications mentioned in the documents. Document [18] states that direct pulp capping is contraindicated in primary teeth, which eliminates option D. Document [18] also mentions that direct pulp capping is indicated for mechanical exposure, which eliminates option A. Document [18] does not mention anything about bleeding or pinpoint exposure, so we cannot definitively determine if these situations are contraindications for direct pulp capping. Therefore, the answer is either B or C. To confirm the correct answer, we would need more information from the documents or additional research. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B/C\"}"
