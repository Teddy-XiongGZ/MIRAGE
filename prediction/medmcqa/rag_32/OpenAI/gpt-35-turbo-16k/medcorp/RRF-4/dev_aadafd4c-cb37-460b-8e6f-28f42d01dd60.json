    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most probable reason for the failure of topical administration of 1% Pilocarpine to produce pupillary constriction in a patient with a large, dilated pupil is Adie's tonic pupil. Adie's tonic pupil is characterized by a dilated pupil that does not constrict normally in response to light but may constrict with near vision. It is a form of tonic pupil disorder that is associated with cholinergic denervation supersensitivity. In this condition, the affected pupil may not respond to dilute concentrations of pilocarpine, such as 1%, which is typically effective in normal pupils. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. Adie's tonic pupil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
