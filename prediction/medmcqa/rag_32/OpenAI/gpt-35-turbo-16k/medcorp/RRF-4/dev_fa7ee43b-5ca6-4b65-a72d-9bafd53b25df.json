    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best time to administer analgesics during extraction, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [6] states that dental pain is largely inflammatory and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the best analgesics for dental pain. Document [11] mentions that there is a strong relationship between the speed of reduction of pain intensity and overall pain relief. Document [27] states that a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg demonstrated a rapid onset of analgesia in approximately half an hour. Based on this information, the best time to administer analgesics during extraction would be when pain is moderate to severe, as this is when the analgesics would be most effective in providing relief.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
