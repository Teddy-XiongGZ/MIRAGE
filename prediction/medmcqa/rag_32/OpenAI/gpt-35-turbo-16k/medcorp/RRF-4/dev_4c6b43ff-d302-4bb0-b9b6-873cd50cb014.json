    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a physiological method of heat loss from the body that is NOT included in the options. To determine the correct answer, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that heat loss occurs through four mechanisms: evaporation, convection, conduction, and radiation. Document [4] specifically mentions that evaporative heat loss occurs through sweating. Document [7] mentions that the flow of blood to the skin (vasodilation) is an effective mechanism for heat transfer from the body core to the environment. Document [22] mentions that heat loss occurs through the rate of heat conduction from body tissues to the skin via the blood. Based on this information, we can conclude that sweating, vasodilation, and conduction are all physiological methods of heat loss from the body. Posture is not mentioned as a specific physiological method of heat loss in any of the documents. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Posture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
