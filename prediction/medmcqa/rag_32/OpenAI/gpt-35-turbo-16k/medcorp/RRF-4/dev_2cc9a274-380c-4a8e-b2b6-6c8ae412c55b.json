    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the ideal instrument used to widen the canal, we need to consider the information provided in the documents. Document [4] mentions the Crown-Down technique, which involves the widening of the canal orifices with Gates-Glidden drills followed by the incremental removal of organic canal contents using manual files. Document [14] compares the use of stainless steel K-files and nickel-titanium Lightspeed Rotary instruments for canal preparation, and it states that the Lightspeed instrument stayed centered in the canals maintaining the central axis, with minimal incidence of transportation, elbow formation, and zipping. Document [24] reviews different types of root canal instruments and states that flexible stainless steel instruments with noncutting tips are superior to titanium-based instruments in both cutting efficiency and instrumentation of curved root canals. Based on this information, the ideal instrument used to widen the canal is a file.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. File\"}"
