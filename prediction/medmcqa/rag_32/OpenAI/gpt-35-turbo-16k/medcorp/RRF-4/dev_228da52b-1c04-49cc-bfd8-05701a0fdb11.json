    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is true about prostate cancer, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Let's go through each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Histopathology is determined by Gleason score: Document [0] mentions the Gleason grading system used for prostate cancer classification. This suggests that histopathology is indeed determined by the Gleason score. Therefore, option A is likely to be true.\\n\\nB. Most common region involved is central zone: There is no specific information provided in the documents about the most common region involved in prostate cancer. Therefore, we cannot determine the accuracy of option B.\\n\\nC. Most common type is squamous cell Carcinoma: There is no mention of squamous cell carcinoma being the most common type of prostate cancer in the provided documents. Therefore, option C is unlikely to be true.\\n\\nD. It is not a hormone dependent cancer: Document [27] mentions that bicalutamide, a medication used in the treatment of prostate cancer, may cause sexual dysfunction and reduced sex drive. This suggests that prostate cancer is hormone-dependent to some extent. Therefore, option D is unlikely to be true.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, option A is the most likely to be true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
