    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the true statements about the occulomotor nerve, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] states that the occulomotor nerve controls all muscles of the eye except for the superior oblique muscle controlled by the trochlear nerve (IV), and the lateral rectus muscle controlled by the abducens nerve (VI). This means that statement C is false. Document [11] mentions that the oculomotor nerve also controls the constriction of the pupils, which supports statement B as true. Document [18] states that the oculomotor nerve has parasympathetic pre-ganglionic fibers responsible for the innervation of sphincter pupillae and ciliary muscles, which supports statement A as true. Finally, document [25] mentions that the oculomotor nerve exits the brainstem and crosses straight to the superior orbital fissure, supporting statement D as true. Therefore, the false statement is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
