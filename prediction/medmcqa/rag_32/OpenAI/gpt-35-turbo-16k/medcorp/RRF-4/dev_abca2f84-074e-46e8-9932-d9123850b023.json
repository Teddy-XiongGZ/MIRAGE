    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a suitable fixative for a routine biopsy specimen. To determine the answer, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that most often formalin is an adequate choice, if not the optimal one, for tissue fixation. Document [4] also mentions that pathologists mostly examine formalin-fixed tissue sections. Document [6] discusses the use of an alcohol-based fixative as an alternative to formalin, but it does not specifically mention routine biopsy specimens. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the most suitable fixative for a routine biopsy specimen is 10% formalin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
