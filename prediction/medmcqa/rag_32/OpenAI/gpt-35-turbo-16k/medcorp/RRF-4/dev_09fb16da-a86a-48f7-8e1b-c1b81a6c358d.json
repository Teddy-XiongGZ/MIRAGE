    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the fixation period of intrusive luxation injury, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] presents a case of severe intrusive luxation in a 40-year-old male, where the intruded tooth was immediately repositioned (surgical extrusion) and splinted within hours following the injury. The splint was removed 2 months later. Document [6] also presents a case of severe intrusive luxation in an 11-year-old girl, where the intruded teeth were repositioned successfully by endodontic and orthodontic management. The splint was removed after 2 months. Based on these cases, it can be inferred that the fixation period for intrusive luxation injury is typically around 2 months. Therefore, the answer choice is C. 4 weeks, if semi-rigid & 2 weeks, if rigid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
