    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about the salivary gland output in Sjogren's syndrome, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [4] states that in Sjogren's syndrome, the output/min of total protein, albumin, amylase, and IgA is decreased. This means that the output of salivary glands is decreased in Sjogren's syndrome. Therefore, statement C is true and not the correct answer. Document [4] also mentions that the absolute concentrations of albumin, cystatin C, cystatin S, total IgA, and total protein are increased in Sjogren's syndrome. This means that statement D is true. However, there is no mention of an increase in sodium concentration or phosphate concentration in the relevant documents. Therefore, statement A and B are not mentioned and their truthfulness cannot be determined. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Decreased output of salivary glands <0.5 ml/min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
