    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient has lower natural teeth and 7 maxillary implants placed. The space available for restoration is 15 mm. To determine the ideal treatment plan, we need to consider the options mentioned in the documents. Document [9] discusses the treatment of a patient with a high smile line using a single-step implant treatment. Document [14] describes the treatment of a patient with 2 missing maxillary central incisors using implant-supported restorations. Document [29] discusses the rehabilitation of completely edentulous patients with implant-supported prosthesis. Considering these options, the ideal treatment plan for the patient would be a hybrid denture, as it provides a fixed and stable restoration for the maxillary arch with multiple implants. This option would be suitable for the patient's condition with 7 maxillary implants and the available space of 15 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hybrid denture\"}"
