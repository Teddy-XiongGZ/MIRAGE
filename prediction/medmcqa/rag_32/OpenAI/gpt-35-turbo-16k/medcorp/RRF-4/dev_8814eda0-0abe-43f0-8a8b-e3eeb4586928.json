    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following anterior pituitary hormones is primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. To answer this, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss the regulation of anterior pituitary hormone secretion by the hypothalamus. Document [1] states that hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland is regulated by hormones secreted by the hypothalamus. Document [5] explains that the hypothalamus controls the anterior pituitary gland via releasing factors and release-inhibiting factors, which are substances released by hypothalamic neurons into blood vessels at the base of the brain. These factors bind to specific receptors on the surface of the hormone-producing cells in the anterior pituitary. Document [19] provides a list of tropic hormones from the anterior pituitary, which includes TSH, ACTH, LH, and FSH, but does not mention somatostatin. Therefore, based on the information provided, the anterior pituitary hormone primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus is likely to be somatostatin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Somatostatin\"}"
