    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the false statement about the innervation of the parotid gland, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the parotid gland receives autonomic innervation from the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is a cranial nerve. Document [5] further confirms that the parotid gland receives parasympathetic innervation from the glossopharyngeal nerve via the otic ganglion. Therefore, the correct statement is that the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers relay in the otic ganglion. Document [16] mentions that the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers originate in the inferior salivatory nucleus, not the inferior petrosal nucleus. Finally, document [19] states that the parotid gland has a dual innervation, with both adrenergic (sympathetic) and cholinergic (parasympathetic) nerves. Therefore, the false statement is D. Sympathetic nerves are vasomotor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
