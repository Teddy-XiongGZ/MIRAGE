    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In alpha-thalassemia trait, there is a decrease in the production of alpha-globin chains, resulting in an excess of beta-globin chains. This leads to the formation of unstable tetramers called hemoglobin H (HbH). Electrophoresis in alpha-thalassemia trait typically shows the presence of HbH, which is a variant of hemoglobin. Therefore, the answer is A. Increased HbF and normal HbA2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
