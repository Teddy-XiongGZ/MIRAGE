    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine where a counter bevel should not be given in a premolar tooth, we need to understand what a counter bevel is. A counter bevel is a bevel that is placed on the external surface of a tooth to provide additional retention for a restoration. It is typically used when there is limited tooth structure available for bonding. Given this information, we can eliminate option D (Any surface of premolar) because a counter bevel can be given on any surface of a premolar if needed. Now, we need to consider the specific surfaces of the premolar tooth. The facial surface refers to the front surface of the tooth, the occlusal surface refers to the biting surface of the tooth, and the lingual surface refers to the back surface of the tooth. Based on the information provided, we do not have any specific contraindications for giving a counter bevel on any of these surfaces. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Any surface of premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
