    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the correct answer by understanding the process of skeletal muscle contraction. Step 1: Skeletal muscle contraction is initiated by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Step 2: The released calcium ions bind to troponin, causing a conformational change. Step 3: This conformational change allows tropomyosin to move, exposing the binding sites on actin. Step 4: Myosin heads bind to the exposed binding sites on actin, forming cross-bridges. Step 5: The myosin heads undergo a power stroke, pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere. Step 6: The sarcomere shortens, resulting in muscle contraction. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Contraction is initiated by calcium binding to troponin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
