    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the answer, we need to refer to the relevant documents and find information about the tensile strength of GIC after 24 hours of setting. We can search for information about the tensile strength of GIC in the documents that discuss the mechanical properties of GICs. Once we find the relevant information, we can compare it to the tensile strength of Znpo4 to determine if it is equal, greater, or lesser.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of the above\"}"
