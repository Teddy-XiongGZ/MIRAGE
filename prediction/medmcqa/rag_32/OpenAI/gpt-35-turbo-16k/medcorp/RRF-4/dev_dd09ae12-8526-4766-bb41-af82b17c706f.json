    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information regarding the force experienced by the alveolar border in case of a mandible fracture can be found in Document [14]. According to this document, transverse mandibular fractures caused by blast waves result in transverse lines of fractures on the mandibular body, and may be associated with transverse shearing of teeth at the cementoenamel junction. This suggests that the alveolar border of the mandible experiences compression force during a fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
