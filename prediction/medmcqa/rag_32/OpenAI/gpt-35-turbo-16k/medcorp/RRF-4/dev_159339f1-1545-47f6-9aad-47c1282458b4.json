    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the effect of proximal cavity design on the cementation of Class II inlays. Document [3] proposes a decision tree protocol for demineralized gingival margin extension in Class II composite cavity preparations. Document [5] reviews and discusses gingival margins for crowns. Document [6] suggests intrasulcular margins for full coverage crowns. Document [7] evaluates the effect of deep margin elevation on CAD/CAM-fabricated ceramic inlays. Document [12] compares the efficacy of different placement techniques in marginal sealing of extended Class V cavities. Document [13] evaluates the influence of a proximal margin elevation technique on marginal adaptation of ceramic inlays. Document [15] discusses the assessment of gingival margin thickness before margin placement. Document [19] examines the interfacial chemistry of Class II composite restorations. Document [21] investigates the effect of different gingival margin restorations on microleakage. Document [23] compares microleakage and thickness of resin cement in ceramic inlays with various temperatures. Document [24] examines the role of additional retention on marginal adaptation and sealing of large resin composite Class II restorations. Document [26] evaluates the effects of flowable composite lining and operator experience on microleakage and internal voids in Class II composite restorations. Document [28] compares the marginal adaptation of different filling materials. Document [29] examines the effect of the site and method of preparation on the marginal adaptation. Document [30] evaluates microleakage in resin composite restorations following antimicrobial pre-treatments. Document [31] evaluates microleakage in resin composite restorations after antimicrobial pre-treatments with 2% chlorhexidine and Clearfil Protect Bond. Based on this information, we can conclude that all of the provided options (A, B, C, and D) are true regarding Class-II inlay gingival margins preparation. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
