    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the primary roots of teeth are described as more divergent and flaring compared to the secondary roots. To determine the other difference, we need to analyze the information in the documents. Document [4] states that the primary teeth molars have the same number of roots as the permanent molars, but the roots of the primary molars are more divergent than those of permanent molars. Document [7] mentions that the root morphology tends to follow a pattern, with central and lateral incisors having single roots. Document [13] states that the mandibular first and second premolars typically present with single roots but may have bifurcated roots in rare situations. Document [17] provides information on root trunk dimensions of different tooth types, but it does not specifically mention primary or secondary teeth. Based on this information, we can conclude that the primary roots of teeth do not show a difference in the presence of accessory and lateral canals compared to secondary roots. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
