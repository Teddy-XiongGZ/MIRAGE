    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no specific information about the exact time it takes for the calcification of roots of deciduous teeth to be completed. However, Document [28] mentions that the root resorption for a tooth on one side is the same as for its counterpart on the other side regardless of differences in sex or arch. This suggests that the completion of root resorption in deciduous teeth may occur around the same time for both sides. Considering the average age of root resorption stages mentioned in Document [28], it is reasonable to assume that the calcification of roots of deciduous teeth may be completed by around 6 years of age.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 6 years\"}"
