    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The major determinant of the loading dose of a drug is the volume of distribution (Vd). The loading dose is calculated using the equation: Loading dose (mg) = [Cp (mg/L) x Vd (L)] / F, where Cp represents the desired plasma concentration of the drug, Vd represents the volume of distribution, and F represents the bioavailability of the drug. The loading dose is necessary to rapidly achieve the desired drug concentration in the body. Half-life, clearance, and bioavailability are not the major determinants of the loading dose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
