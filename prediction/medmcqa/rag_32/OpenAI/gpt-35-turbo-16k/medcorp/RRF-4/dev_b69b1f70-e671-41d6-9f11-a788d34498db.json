    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which amino acid does not include post-translational modification, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] states that proteinogenic amino acids are amino acids that are incorporated biosynthetically into proteins during translation. This means that they are not subject to post-translational modification. Therefore, we need to identify which of the given amino acids are proteinogenic amino acids. Document [8] also mentions that there are 22 genetically encoded (proteinogenic) amino acids. From the given choices, Selenocysteine and Triiodothyronine are not among the 22 genetically encoded amino acids, so they are not proteinogenic amino acids and are not subject to post-translational modification. Hydroxyproline and Hydroxy-lysine, on the other hand, are proteinogenic amino acids and can undergo post-translational modification. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Selenocysteine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
