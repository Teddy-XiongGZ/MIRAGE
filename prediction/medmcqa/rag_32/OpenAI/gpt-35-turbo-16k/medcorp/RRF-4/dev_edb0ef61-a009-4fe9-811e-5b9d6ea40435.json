    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the chances of ankyloses of a mandibular molar that is autotransplanted, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] states that there is an increased risk of ankylosis of the transplanted permanent tooth if the primary tooth at the recipient site is in infraposition. Document [16] mentions that the occlusal morphology and root form of the autotransplanted tooth can affect the stress in the surrounding bone and the risk of root resorption. Document [27] suggests that the success rate of autotransplantation depends on the conditions of the recipient site. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the chances of ankyloses of a mandibular molar that is autotransplanted depend on the conditions of the recipient site, including the position of the primary tooth and the occlusal morphology and root form of the transplanted tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
