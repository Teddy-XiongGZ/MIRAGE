    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the Golgi apparatus in serous acinar cells is typically located in the supranuclear region. Document [0] mentions that the Golgi apparatus is present in the medial and trans-Golgi cisternae and trans-Golgi network (TGN) of serous exocrine cells. Document [5] also supports this by stating that the Golgi apparatus is present in the apical portion of parotid gland serous cells, which is located near the lumen of the acinus. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Supranuclear.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
