    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the ideal denture base material, we need to consider the characteristics that it should have. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Sufficient strength: This is an important characteristic for a denture base material as it needs to withstand the forces of mastication. Therefore, it is desirable for the denture base material to have sufficient strength.\\n\\nB. Dense and non-irritating surface: A denture base material should have a smooth and non-irritating surface to prevent discomfort and irritation to the oral tissues. Therefore, it is desirable for the denture base material to have a dense and non-irritating surface.\\n\\nC. High specific gravity: Specific gravity refers to the density of a material. A high specific gravity may indicate that the material is heavy, which can affect the comfort and wearability of the denture. Therefore, it is not desirable for the denture base material to have a high specific gravity.\\n\\nD. Esthetically acceptable: The esthetic appearance of a denture is important for patient satisfaction. Therefore, it is desirable for the denture base material to be esthetically acceptable.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the option that does not align with the characteristics of an ideal denture base material is C. High specific gravity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
