    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times, we need to calculate the 95% confidence interval. The formula for the confidence interval is: CI = X\u0304 \u00b1 (Z * (SD / \u221an)), where X\u0304 is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 95% corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96), SD is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size. Given that the average is 30 mm, the SD is 1, and the sample size is 100, we can calculate the confidence interval as follows: CI = 30 \u00b1 (1.96 * (1 / \u221a100)). Simplifying the equation, we get CI = 30 \u00b1 (1.96 * 0.1). Therefore, the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times is 30 - (1.96 * 0.1) = 30 - 0.196 = 29.804. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the answer is 30.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 28\"}"
