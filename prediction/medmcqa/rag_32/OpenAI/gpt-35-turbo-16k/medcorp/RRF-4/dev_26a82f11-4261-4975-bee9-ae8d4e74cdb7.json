    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, myocardial ischemia occurs whenever there is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Myocardial ischemia refers to a condition where there is inadequate blood flow and oxygen supply to a portion of the myocardium. Therefore, the answer is not A. Sudden Death, as sudden death is a severe consequence of myocardial ischemia but not the term used to describe the imbalance itself. The answer is also not B. Stable angina or C. Unstable angina, as these are specific types of chest pain that can result from myocardial ischemia but do not encompass the broader concept of an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand. The correct answer is D. Myocardial infarction, as this term refers to the death of myocardial tissue due to prolonged ischemia resulting from an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
