    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] states that in posteromedial displacement of the distal fragment, the reduction is performed in pronation which tensions the medial periosteum and prevents varus malalignment. This suggests that the distal segment is dislocated posteriorly more than anteriorly. Therefore, option A is not true. Document [20] mentions that a decrease in carrying angle by at least 10 degrees is associated with the least satisfactory subjective results, indicating that cubitus varus is more common than cubitus valgus during malunion. Therefore, option B is not true. Document [15] states that peri-operative nerve palsy can occur and may require a return to the operating room for any reason, suggesting that nerve injury related manifestations are not always transitory. Therefore, option C is not true. Finally, there is no information in the provided documents that directly supports or refutes option D. Therefore, the correct answer is: None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
