    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polycystic ovarian disease, also known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is a complex endocrine disorder. To determine which statement is not true about PCOS, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [9] states that PCOS is a hyperandrogenic state with oligo-anovulation that cannot be explained by any other disorder. Document [15] mentions that women with PCOS are known to be uniquely insulin resistant. Document [26] indicates that women with PCOS and polycystic-appearing ovaries do not demonstrate any definitive serum hormonal differences compared with women with PCOS and normal-appearing ovaries. Document [25] states that PCOS is a multifactorial disease with a genetic component. Based on this information, we can conclude that the statement 'Increased prolactin' is not true about PCOS, as there is no mention of increased prolactin levels in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
