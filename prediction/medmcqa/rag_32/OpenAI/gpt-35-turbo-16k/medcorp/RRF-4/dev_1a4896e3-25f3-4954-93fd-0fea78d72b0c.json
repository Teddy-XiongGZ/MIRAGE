    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss autosomal dominant inheritance. Document [0] explains that autosomal dominant traits are associated with a single gene on an autosome (non-sex chromosome), and a single copy of the gene inherited from either parent is enough to cause the trait to appear. Document [2] further supports this by stating that an individual needs to inherit at least one dominant allele for a disorder gene to be affected or show the phenotype. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is the disorder that is associated with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
