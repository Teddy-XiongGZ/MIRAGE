    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about piperacillin, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [20] states that piperacillin is a broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotic of the ureidopenicillin class and is active against many Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Document [18] mentions that piperacillin is active against many Gram-negative bacilli, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Document [28] states that piperacillin-tazobactam, which contains piperacillin, is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, it can be concluded that piperacillin is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, so statement A is true. Document [18] also mentions that piperacillin is used in combination with the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam, which enhances piperacillin's effectiveness by inhibiting many beta-lactamases to which it is susceptible. This indicates that piperacillin inhibits beta-lactamase, so statement B is true. Document [20] states that piperacillin is a ureidopenicillin, so statement C is true. Finally, document [2] mentions that piperacillin is dissolved in a solution before being administered to a patient through parenteral means, indicating that it is given parenterally, so statement D is true. Therefore, the statement that is not true about piperacillin is: A. Active against pseudomonas aeruginosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
