    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the force needed for intrusion of four mandibular anterior teeth, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that Bench et al. suggested an intrusive force of 15-20g per lower incisor and 60-80g for all four lower incisors. Liu et al. proposed a force of 100g for all four incisors. However, it is important to note that higher force can result in various side-effects on teeth, as mentioned in Document [2]. Therefore, based on the available information, the force needed for intrusion of four mandibular anterior teeth is likely to be in the range of 60-100g. Among the given choices, the closest option is B. 100gm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
