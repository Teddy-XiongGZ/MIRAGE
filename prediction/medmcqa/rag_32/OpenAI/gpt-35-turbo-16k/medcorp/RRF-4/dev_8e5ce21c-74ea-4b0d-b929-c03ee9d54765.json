    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that the levator ani muscle is responsible for 'wagging' the tail in tailed quadrupeds, which suggests that it is not attached at the pelvic brim. Document [19] describes the levator ani muscle as consisting of two portions: pubococcygeus and iliococcygeus, which confirms that these are components of the muscle. Document [24] mentions that the levator ani muscle is funnel-shaped and consists of a transverse portion called the levator plate and a vertical portion called the suspensory sling, which suggests that the fibers are directed posterior and medial. Finally, document [25] states that the levator ani muscles are responsible for sustained contraction and long-term closure of the urethra, which indicates that they support the pelvic viscera. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Levator ani muscle is attached at pelvic brim.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
