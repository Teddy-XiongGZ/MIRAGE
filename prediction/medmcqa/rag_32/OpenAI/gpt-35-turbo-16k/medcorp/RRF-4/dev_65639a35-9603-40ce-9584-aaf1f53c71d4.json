    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is presenting with bradycardia and low blood pressure, indicating decreased myocardial contractility. To choose the contraindicated anesthetic agent, we need to consider the effects of each option on myocardial contractility. Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic and does not directly affect myocardial contractility. Etomidate is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic that has minimal effects on myocardial contractility. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that can increase myocardial contractility. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that can decrease myocardial contractility. Given the patient's decreased myocardial contractility, the contraindicated anesthetic agent would be D. Dexmedetomidine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
