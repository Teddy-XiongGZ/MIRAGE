    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A molecule with a permanent dipole occurs when two atoms in a molecule have substantially different electronegativity, causing one atom to attract electrons more than the other. Based on the information provided, the molecule with a permanent dipole is likely to be water (H2O) because it contains two polar O-H bonds in a bent (nonlinear) geometry. The bond dipole moments do not cancel, resulting in a net dipole moment for the molecule. Oxygen (O2) is a diatomic molecule and does not have a permanent dipole moment. Helium (He) is a noble gas and does not form polar bonds. Liquid nitrogen (N2) is also a diatomic molecule and does not have a permanent dipole moment. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
