    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which group of fibers are not attached to alveolar bone, we need to find information about the attachment of each group of fibers in the relevant documents. The relevant documents that mention the attachment of fibers to alveolar bone are Document [0], Document [1], Document [3], Document [7], Document [9], Document [11], Document [12], Document [14], Document [21], Document [22], Document [23], and Document [28]. After reviewing these documents, we can conclude that the group of fibers that are not attached to alveolar bone is the Transseptal fibers. This information is mentioned in Document [2], which states that Transseptal fibers do not have an osseous attachment and are considered to belong to the gingival tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
