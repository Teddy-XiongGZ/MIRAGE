    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can gather information about the features of cardiac rest pain. Document [0] mentions that classic coronary pain, or angina, involves substernal pressure that commonly begins with exertion and is relieved by rest. Document [1] describes chest pain associated with myocardial infarction as a sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing that radiates to various areas such as the left arm, lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and upper abdomen. Document [3] states that angina is typically described as retrosternal and diffuse, radiating to the left arm/jaw, and is often described as an aching, pressure-like sensation. Document [7] mentions that typical angina is described as a crushing or squeezing substernal sensation that often radiates down the left arm or to the left jaw. Based on this information, we can conclude that features of cardiac rest pain are compressive, radiating, and can be described as aching or pressure-like. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
