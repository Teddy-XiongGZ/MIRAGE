    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Local anesthetics (LAs) act by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, in particular the voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. Therefore, LA blocks the conductance of Na+ from exterior to interior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
