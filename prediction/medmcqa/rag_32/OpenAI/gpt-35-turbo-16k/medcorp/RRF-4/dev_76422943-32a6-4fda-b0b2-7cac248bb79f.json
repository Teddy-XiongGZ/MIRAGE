    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A p-value of 0.00 indicates that the observed result is extremely unlikely to occur by chance alone. In hypothesis testing, a p-value less than the predetermined alpha level (usually 0.05) is considered statistically significant, which means that the null hypothesis is rejected. Since the p-value is 0.00, it is less than any conventional alpha level, so the test is highly significant. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Test is not significant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
