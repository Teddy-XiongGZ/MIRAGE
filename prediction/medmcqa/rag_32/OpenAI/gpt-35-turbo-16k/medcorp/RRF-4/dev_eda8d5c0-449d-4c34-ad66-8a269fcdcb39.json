    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biotin is a coenzyme for carboxylases in the human body, including propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. These carboxylases are involved in amino acid catabolism, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism. Biotin deficiency affects the activity of carboxylases, so the correct answer is D. Carboxylase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
