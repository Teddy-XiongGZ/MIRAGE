    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is not done for antenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome, we need to review the relevant documents for information on the diagnostic methods used. Document [0] mentions that antenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome was made through amniocentesis and karyotyping of fetal cells. Document [2] states that amniocentesis and karyotyping are definitive methods of making the diagnosis antenatally. Document [3] mentions that amniocentesis is traditionally performed for karyotype analysis in pregnant women aged 35 years and older. Document [4] discusses the performance of antenatal serum screening for Down's syndrome using the quadruple test, but does not mention cordocentesis. Based on this information, it can be concluded that cordocentesis is not done for antenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome. Therefore, the answer is C. Cordocentesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
