    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Restriction endonucleases are enzymes that cleave DNA at specific target sequences. The recognition site for most restriction endonucleases is a short palindromic sequence. To determine which sequence a restriction endonuclease cuts at, we need to find the specific recognition sequence for the given restriction endonuclease. We can search for this information in the relevant documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
