    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the muscle spindle is a receptor for stretch receptor reflex. Muscle spindles are stretch receptors within the body of a skeletal muscle that primarily detect changes in the length of the muscle. They convey length information to the central nervous system via afferent nerve fibers. This information can be processed by the brain as proprioception. The muscle spindle has both sensory and motor components. Sensory information is conveyed by primary type Ia sensory fibers and secondary type II sensory fibers. Activation of muscle fibers within the spindle is primarily caused by gamma motor neurons and to a lesser extent by beta motor neurons. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Receptor for stretch receptor reflex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
