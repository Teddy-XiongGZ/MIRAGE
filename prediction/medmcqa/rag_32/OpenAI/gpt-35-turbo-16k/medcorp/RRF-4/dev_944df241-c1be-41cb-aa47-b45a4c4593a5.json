    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is clear that ionic exchange between enamel surface and the environment continues throughout life. Document [1] mentions that the labile pools of Mg, Na, and K ions in enamel samples were assessed, indicating ongoing exchange of these ions. Document [3] discusses the effect of fluoride on ion exchange in enamel, suggesting that the exchange process is not limited to a specific time period. Additionally, document [7] discusses the passive and iontophoretic transport of fluorides across enamel, further supporting the idea of ongoing ionic exchange. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Continues throughout life.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
