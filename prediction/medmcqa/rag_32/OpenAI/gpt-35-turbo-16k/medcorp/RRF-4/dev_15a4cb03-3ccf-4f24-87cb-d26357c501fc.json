    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Wide divergent roots of primary teeth can lead to problems during resorption and extraction. During resorption, if the roots are wide and divergent, the apical 1/3rd of the roots may remain unresorbed, leading to complications such as over-retained primary teeth. Additionally, during extraction, the wide and divergent roots can increase the risk of fracture, especially in the apical 1/3rd of the roots. Therefore, both options A and B are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
