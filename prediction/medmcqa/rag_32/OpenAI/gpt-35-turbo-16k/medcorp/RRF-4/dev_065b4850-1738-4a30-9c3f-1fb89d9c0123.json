    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein that is produced by the fetal yolk sac and fetal liver during gestation. It is present in fetal serum, amniotic fluid, and maternal serum. The question asks for the maximum level of alpha-fetoprotein, so we need to determine where the highest levels are found. According to the documents, the normal range of AFP levels in fetal serum spans approximately two orders of magnitude. However, very high AFP levels may be subject to hooking, resulting in the level being reported significantly lower than the actual concentration. In amniotic fluid, AFP levels usually range between 10 ng/ml to 150 ng/ml. In maternal serum, AFP levels start to rise from about the 14th week of gestation and can range from 0 ng/ml to 40 ng/ml in men and non-pregnant women. Elevated AFP levels can also be found in patients with liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Based on this information, the maximum level of alpha-fetoprotein is seen in: \", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Fetal serum\"}"
