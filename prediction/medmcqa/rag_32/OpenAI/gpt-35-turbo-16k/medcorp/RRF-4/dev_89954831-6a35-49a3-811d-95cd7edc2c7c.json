    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information states that HbS migrates more slowly toward the anode (positive electrode) than HbA during electrophoresis at alkaline pH. This is because HbS has a substitution of glutamic acid with valine, resulting in the absence of negatively charged glutamate residues in the two \u03b2 chains, making HbS less negative than HbA. Therefore, the mobility of HbS is decreased compared to normal hemoglobin (HbA).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
