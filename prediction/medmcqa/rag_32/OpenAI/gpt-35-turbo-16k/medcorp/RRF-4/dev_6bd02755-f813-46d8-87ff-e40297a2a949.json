    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the adrenal gland in females secretes DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone). Document [1] states that the fetal zone of the adrenal gland produces large amounts of adrenal androgens, including DHEA, which are used by the placenta for estrogen biosynthesis. Document [15] also mentions that the zona reticularis, which is part of the adrenal cortex, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs.
