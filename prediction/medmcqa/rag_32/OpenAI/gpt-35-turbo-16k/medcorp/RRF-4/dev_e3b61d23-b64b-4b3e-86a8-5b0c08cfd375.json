    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which disease affects neurons only, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [23] states that in all forms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), only motor neurons are affected, while sensory neurons are not affected. Document [19] also mentions that progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), which is classified among motor neuron diseases, affects only the lower motor neurons. Based on this information, we can conclude that the disease that affects neurons only is progressive muscular atrophy (PMA).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
