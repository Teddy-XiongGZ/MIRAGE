    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the true statements about the LDL receptor. \\n\\n1. The LDL receptor recognizes apo B100 and apo E. This is mentioned in Document [12] which states that the LDL receptor is found in the liver and most other tissues and it recognizes Apo B100 and Apo E, mediating the uptake of LDL, chylomicron remnants, and IDL through endocytosis.\\n\\n2. The LDL receptor is involved in the endocytosis process. This is mentioned in Document [1] which states that the LDL receptor mediates the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL and thus maintains the plasma level of LDL. It also mentions that LDL receptors are clustered in clathrin-coated pits, and coated pits pinch off from the surface to form coated endocytic vesicles that carry LDL into the cell.\\n\\n3. The LDL receptor is present in both hepatic and extrahepatic cells. This is mentioned in Document [1] which states that LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs in all nucleated cells, but mainly in the liver which removes ~70% of LDL from the circulation.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
