    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red blood cells. It is positive in conditions where immune-mediated hemolytic anemia is suspected, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, alloimmune hemolysis, and drug-induced immune-mediated mechanism. Aplastic anemia is not typically associated with immune-mediated destruction of red blood cells, so the direct Coombs test would not be positive in this condition. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Aplastic anemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
