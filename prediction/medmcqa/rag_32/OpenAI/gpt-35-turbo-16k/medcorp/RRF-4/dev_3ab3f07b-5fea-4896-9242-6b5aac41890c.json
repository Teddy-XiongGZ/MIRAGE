    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about the larynx, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] states that the larynx is a cartilaginous skeleton, ligaments, and muscles. Document [19] mentions that there are two types of ligaments in the larynx: extrinsic ligaments that attach the larynx to other structures and intrinsic ligaments that connect the larynx cartilages. Document [15] states that the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles abduct the vocal cords. Document [21] mentions that the larynx serves the vital function of keeping ingested food and water from entering the lungs. Based on this information, we can determine that statement A is true because the intrinsic muscles of the larynx are indeed supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Statement B is also true because the cricothyroid muscle is supplied by the external laryngeal nerve, as mentioned in Document [21]. Statement C is true because the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles do indeed abduct the vocal cords, as mentioned in Document [15]. Therefore, the statement that is not true about the larynx is statement D, which states that the lymphatic drainage of the larynx is to the deep cervical nodes. There is no information provided in the relevant documents about the lymphatic drainage of the larynx.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
