    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In order to determine which statement is not seen in 3rd nerve palsy, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that the most common error in misdiagnosed cases of 3rd nerve palsy is failure to correctly interpret the physical examination. Document [2] states that the oculomotor nerve (3rd nerve) is most frequently affected in ocular nerve palsies, and Document [10] mentions that with pupil sparing, the most common cause of 3rd nerve palsy is ischaemic microvascular disease. Based on this information, we can conclude that pupil dilation (choice A) is not seen in 3rd nerve palsy, as pupil sparing is mentioned as a common feature. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Pupil dilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
