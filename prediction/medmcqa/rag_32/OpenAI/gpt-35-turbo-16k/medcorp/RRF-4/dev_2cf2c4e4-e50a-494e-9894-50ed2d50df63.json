    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The strength of association between the risk factor and disease is measured by the odds ratio/relative risk. The odds ratio/relative risk is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength of the association between an exposure (risk factor) and an outcome (disease). It compares the odds of the outcome occurring in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome occurring in the unexposed group. A high odds ratio/relative risk indicates a strong association between the risk factor and the disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Odds ratio/Relative risk\"}"
