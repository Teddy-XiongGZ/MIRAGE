    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which heart disease has the highest maternal mortality, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that maternal mortality due to cardiac disease in Turkey was primarily caused by cardiac disorders, with valvular heart disease being the leading cause. Document [2] mentions that maternal mortality due to heart disease in a low-resource setting was primarily caused by occult maternal heart disease, with rheumatic heart disease being the most common condition. Document [4] states that cardiac disease is the most common cause of indirect maternal deaths, with cardiac disease mortality rates decreasing over time. Document [8] mentions that rheumatic cardiac disease with mitral valve involvement was the most common cardiac disease in pregnant women, and pulmonary edema was associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the highest maternal mortality is likely to be associated with mitral stenosis, as it is a common complication of rheumatic heart disease and can lead to pulmonary edema and other severe complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
