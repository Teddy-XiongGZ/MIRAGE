    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a person lies down, there are several physiological changes that occur. First, there is an immediate increase in venous return, meaning that more blood is returning to the heart. This is because when a person lies down, the force of gravity is no longer pulling blood downwards, allowing it to flow more easily back to the heart. Second, the heart rate typically becomes stable at slightly more than normal. This is because lying down reduces the workload on the heart, leading to a decrease in heart rate. Third, cerebral blood flow increases and becomes stable at more than normal. When a person lies down, blood flow to the brain increases due to the redistribution of blood from the lower extremities. Finally, blood flow to the apex of the lung decreases. This is because when a person lies down, the diaphragm moves upwards, reducing the blood flow to the lower parts of the lungs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
