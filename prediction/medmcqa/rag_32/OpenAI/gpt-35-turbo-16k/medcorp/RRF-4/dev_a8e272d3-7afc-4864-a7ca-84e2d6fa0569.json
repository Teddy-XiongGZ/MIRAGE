    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the preferable core material for a molar tooth, we need to consider the characteristics and requirements of the core. A chemically cured composite is preferred for a core build-up on a molar tooth because it offers sufficient strength, is esthetically acceptable, and is less brittle compared to a light-cured resin. The lower viscosity of a chemically cured composite allows for better flow around pins and posts, ensuring a secure and stable core.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
