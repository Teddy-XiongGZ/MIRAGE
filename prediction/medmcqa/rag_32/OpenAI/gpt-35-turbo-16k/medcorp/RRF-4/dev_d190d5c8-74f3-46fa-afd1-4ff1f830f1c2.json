    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about fresh frozen plasma, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] states that fresh frozen plasma contains all coagulation factors except platelets, so statement A is true. Document [4] mentions that fresh frozen plasma must be ABO compatible with the recipient's red cells, so statement B is also true. Document [9] states that fresh frozen plasma may be used in the treatment of deficiencies of coagulation proteins for which specific factor concentrates are unavailable or undesirable, so statement C is true. However, there is no information provided about fresh frozen plasma needing to be used within 30 minutes of having trauma, so statement D is the one that is not true about fresh frozen plasma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
