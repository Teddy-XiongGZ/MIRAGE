    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels, we need to calculate the value at the 5th percentile. The 5th percentile is the value below which 5% of the data falls. We can calculate this by subtracting 1.645 times the standard deviation from the mean. In this case, the mean is 10.6 g/dL and the standard deviation is 2 g/dL. So, the calculation would be: 10.6 - (1.645 * 2) = 7.32 g/dL. Therefore, the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels is 7.32 g/dL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
