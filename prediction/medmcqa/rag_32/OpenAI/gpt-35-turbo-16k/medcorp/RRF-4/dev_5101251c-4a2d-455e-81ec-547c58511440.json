    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis is characterized by abnormal permanently dilated bronchi, which can lead to respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough. Auscultation is a physical examination technique that involves listening to the sounds produced by the lungs and airways. In bronchiectasis, auscultation findings can vary depending on the severity and location of the bronchiectasis. Crackles are abnormal lung sounds that can be heard on auscultation and are commonly associated with bronchiectasis. Bibasilar crepitations are also a possible finding on auscultation in patients with bronchiectasis. Tubular breath sounds are not typically associated with bronchiectasis. Based on this information, the most likely finding on auscultation in a patient with post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis would be bibasilar crepitations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
