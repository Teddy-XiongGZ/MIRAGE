    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which intravenous anesthetic agent is contraindicated in epileptic patients posted for general anesthesia, we need to review the relevant documents for information on the interactions between anesthetic agents and epilepsy. Document [1] states that the main anesthetic drugs to avoid in epileptic patients are alfentanil, remifentanil, and sevoflurane. Document [5] mentions that the main anesthetic drugs to avoid are alfentanil, remifentanil, and sevoflurane, but their contraindications are only relative. Document [7] discusses the effects of anesthetic drugs on epilepsy but does not specifically mention contraindications. Document [14] states that certain anesthetics have been reported to cause perioperative seizures, but it does not specify which ones. Document [20] mentions that most anesthetics and analgesics have both pro- and anticonvulsant activity, but it does not provide specific contraindications. Based on the available information, it is unclear which intravenous anesthetic agent is contraindicated in epileptic patients posted for general anesthesia. Therefore, the answer is not determinable from the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not determinable\"}"
