    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that regulates iron homeostasis. It acts by binding to the iron exporter ferroportin, inducing its internalization and degradation. Therefore, hepcidin inhibits the function of ferroportin, which is responsible for exporting iron from cells. Among the given choices, ferroportin is the correct answer as hepcidin inhibits its function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
