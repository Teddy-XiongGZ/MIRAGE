    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine where viruses are cultured, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that virus cultures require host cells in which the virus multiplies. For bacteriophages, cultures are grown by infecting bacterial cells. Document [1] states that human and monkey cells are used in both traditional viral culture and shell vial culture. Document [2] mentions that the culture of viruses requires the culture of cells of mammalian, plant, fungal, or bacterial origin as hosts for the growth and replication of the virus. Document [4] explains that viral culture is a laboratory technique in which samples of a virus are placed on different cell lines. Based on this information, it can be concluded that viruses are cultured in host cells, which can be of mammalian, plant, fungal, or bacterial origin. Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options given.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
