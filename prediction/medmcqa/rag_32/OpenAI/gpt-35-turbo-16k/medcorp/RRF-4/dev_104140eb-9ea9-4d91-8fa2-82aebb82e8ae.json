    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the use of grids in radiography. Document [4] mentions that the use of grids improves image quality by reducing scatter radiation. However, it also states that the use of grids requires a greater radiation exposure to the patient as a good deal of primary beam is attenuated by the lead slats. Document [19] also mentions that the use of grids increases the radiation dose to the patient. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Increased secondary radiation fog to film.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
