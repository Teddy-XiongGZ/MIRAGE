    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the method used for bone sounding in modern times, we need to analyze the relevant documents. None of the documents specifically mention bone sounding, so we need to look for information related to bone sounding methods. Document [2] titled 'History of bone acoustic in fracture diagnosis: crepitus in antiquity; bone percussion with Auenbrugger; bone auscultation with Laennec and Lisfranc; monitoring cementless hip arthroplasty fixation with acoustic and sensor.' mentions the history of acoustic methods used in fracture diagnosis, including bone percussion and bone auscultation. However, it does not provide information about modern methods. Document [8] titled 'Direct bone conduction stimulation: Ipsilateral effect of different transducer attachments in active transcutaneous devices.' discusses the attachment methods of transducers for direct stimulation of the skull bone, but it does not mention bone sounding. Document [14] titled 'Stunning' discusses different stunning methods used in slaughterhouses, but it is not relevant to bone sounding. Based on the information from the documents, we cannot definitively determine the method used for bone sounding in modern times.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
