    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the most difficult maxillary tooth to anaesthetize by infiltration can be determined by considering the success rates of infiltration anaesthesia for different teeth. Document [15] states that a combination of labial and lingual infiltration is the most reliable method for obtaining pulpal anaesthesia in mandibular permanent central incisors. However, Document [10] mentions that intraligamentary injections are unreliable and have a 0% success rate for anaesthetizing the mandibular central incisor region. Therefore, it can be inferred that the most difficult tooth to anaesthetize by infiltration is the mandibular central incisor. However, the question specifically asks about the maxillary tooth. Unfortunately, there is no specific information provided in the documents about the success rates of infiltration anaesthesia for different maxillary teeth. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine the most difficult maxillary tooth to anaesthetize by infiltration based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information provided\"}"
