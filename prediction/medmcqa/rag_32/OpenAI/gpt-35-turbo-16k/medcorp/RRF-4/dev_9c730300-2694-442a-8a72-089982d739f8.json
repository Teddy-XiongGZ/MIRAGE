    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the best way to assess the tissue response to oral hygiene instruction. To determine the answer, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses a study that evaluated the success of different forms of oral hygiene instruction based on parameters such as plaque index, bleeding index, and periodontal index. Document [3] also discusses a study that evaluated the effect of self-instructional oral hygiene manuals on plaque and gingival bleeding scores. Document [12] mentions a study that evaluated the soft tissue response of periodontal pockets to root planing and oral hygiene. Based on this information, it can be inferred that changes in plaque scores and reduced tendency to bleed on probing the gingival margin are the most relevant indicators of tissue response to oral hygiene instruction. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Reduced tendency to bleed on probing the gingival margin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
