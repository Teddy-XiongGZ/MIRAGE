    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement about Pseudomonas is false, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] provides a brief history of Pseudomonas and mentions that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an emerging opportunistic pathogen of clinical relevance. Document [1] mentions that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the Gram-negative bacteria tested for antimicrobial activity. Document [3] discusses the antibiotic susceptibility testing of Shewanella putrefaciens, which is a different bacterium but provides some information about Pseudomonas aeruginosa being resistant to penicillin. Document [5] mentions the effect of houttuyfonate sodium on eliminating adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and forming biofilms. Document [7] discusses the misidentification of a polystyrene-degrading bacterium as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Document [15] mentions Pseudomonas septicaemia in apparently healthy children. Document [19] discusses the pyrimidine salvage pathways in Pseudomonas and former pseudomonads. Document [26] mentions the etiologic bacteria of pneumonia in the elderly, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on this information, we can determine that statement D is false because Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not the most common organism in burn patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
