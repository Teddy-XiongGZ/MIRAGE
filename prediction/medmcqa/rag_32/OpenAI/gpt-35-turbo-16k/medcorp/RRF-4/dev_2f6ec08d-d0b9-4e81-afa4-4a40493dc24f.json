    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the impact of filler particle size on composite properties is discussed. Document [0] states that a general decreasing trend in toughness, elastic modulus, ductility, and tensile strength is observed with decreasing particle size. Document [2] mentions that resin composites with non-aggregated silica nanoparticles showed an increase in flexural modulus and compressive strength up to a certain filler concentration, but a further increase in filler concentration diminished all mechanical properties. Document [5] states that microfilled fillers with smaller particle size have compromised mechanical properties and are contraindicated for load-bearing situations. Document [15] mentions that an increase in particle size of silica filler resulted in a decrease in curing depth and Knoop hardness of the resin composite. Based on this information, it can be concluded that increased size of filler particle in composite does not increase strength, decrease surface roughness, increase exposure time, or decrease viscosity. Therefore, the correct answer is D. decreases viscosity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
