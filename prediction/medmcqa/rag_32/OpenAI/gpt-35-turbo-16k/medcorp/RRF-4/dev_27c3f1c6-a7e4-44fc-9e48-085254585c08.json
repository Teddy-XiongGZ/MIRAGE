    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, growth hormone (GH) has been consistently shown to stimulate granulation tissue formation and enhance wound healing. GH has been found to increase the concentration of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mRNA in the ingrown granulation tissue, increase wound tensile strength, enhance collagen deposition, and improve the biomechanical properties of wounds. Therefore, the hormone having the maximum effect on granulation wound healing is growth hormone (GH).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
