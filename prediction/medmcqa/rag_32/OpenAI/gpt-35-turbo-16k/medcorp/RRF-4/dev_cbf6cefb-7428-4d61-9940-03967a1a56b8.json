    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mean electrical axis of the heart is 90 degrees. To determine the lead with the maximum voltage of the R wave, we need to look for the lead that is perpendicular (90 degrees) to the mean axis. According to the hexaxial reference system, lead aVR is perpendicular to the mean axis. Therefore, the lead with the maximum voltage of the R wave would be aVR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
