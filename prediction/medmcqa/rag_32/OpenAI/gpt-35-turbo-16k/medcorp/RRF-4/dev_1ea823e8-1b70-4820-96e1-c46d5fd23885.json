It can also occur with severe features, which are defined as: systolic blood pressure \u2265160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265110 mmHg despite escalation of antihypertensive therapy; thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/microL); impaired liver function; new-onset or worsening renal insufficiency; pulmonary edema; or persistent cerebral or visual disturbances.
