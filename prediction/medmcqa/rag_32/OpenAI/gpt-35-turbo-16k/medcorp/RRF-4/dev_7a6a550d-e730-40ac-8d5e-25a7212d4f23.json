    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the percentage of mandibular incisors with 2 root canals, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that 12.08% of canines had two roots, but it does not provide information specifically about mandibular incisors. Document [1] mentions that the prevalence of bilateral symmetry of double root canals in mandibular central incisors was 44.4%, but it does not provide information about the overall percentage of mandibular incisors with 2 root canals. Document [2] states that roots with two canals were more frequent in incisors (14.9% and 17.2% for central and lateral incisors, respectively). Document [3] mentions that 1.32% of canines had 2 roots, but it does not provide information specifically about mandibular incisors. Document [4] states that 22.6% of central mandibular incisors and 24.3% of lateral mandibular incisors exhibited two root canals. Document [5] mentions that 6.7% of central incisors, 17.4% of lateral incisors, and 3.0% of canines had double root canals. Document [6] states that the incidence of two root canals in mandibular lateral incisors was 35%, but it does not provide information specifically about mandibular central incisors. Document [7] mentions that the prevalence of more than 1 root canal in mandibular central and mandibular lateral incisors was 40.5% and 37.9%, respectively. Document [8] states that the prevalence of dual-canal in mandibular lateral teeth was 35%, but it does not provide information specifically about mandibular central incisors. Document [9] mentions that 6.7% of central incisors, 17.4% of lateral incisors, and 3.0% of canines had double root canals. Document [10] states that 26.2% of mandibular central incisors and 30.8% of lateral incisors had two canals. Document [11] mentions that 86.8% of mandibular incisors had a single root with a single canal, but it does not provide information specifically about the percentage of mandibular incisors with 2 root canals. Document [12] states that 29.7% of mandibular lateral teeth had dual-canal, but it does not provide information specifically about mandibular central incisors. Document [13] mentions that 60% of central incisors and 74% of lateral incisors had no accessory canals. Document [14] states that all the sample teeth had a single root with a single root canal. Document [15] mentions that 92% of the specimens had Type I or Type III canal configurations. Document [16] states that the most common classification was 1ManA1 (Vertucci type I), followed by 1ManA1-2-1 (Vertucci type III; 13%). Document [17] mentions that the prevalence of two canal systems in mandibular incisors was approximately 40%. Document [18] states that 10.9% of mandibular central incisors, 25.5% of lateral incisors, and 18.2% of all mandibular incisors had two canals. Document [19] mentions that 26.2% of mandibular incisors had two roots, but it does not provide information specifically about mandibular incisors with 2 root canals. Document [20] states that the prevalence of two canals in mandibular central and mandibular lateral incisors was 40.5% and 37.9%, respectively. Document [21] mentions that 29.7% of mandibular lateral teeth had dual root canals. Document [22] states that 26.3% of mandibular central incisors, 30.8% of lateral incisors, and 28.6% of all mandibular incisors had two canals. Document [23] mentions that 21% of mandibular second molars had one root. Document [24] states that 86.3% of mandibular second molars had two roots. Document [25] mentions that 73% of mandibular incisors had two roots. Document [26] states that 7.2% of mandibular incisors had C-shaped canals. Document [27] mentions that 3.5% of mandibular incisors had C-shaped canals. Document [28] states that 3.5% of mandibular incisors had C-shaped canals. Document [29] mentions that 26.2% of mandibular incisors had two roots. Document [30] states that 7.2% of mandibular incisors had C-shaped canals. Document [31] mentions that 9.3% of mandibular incisors had one root. Based on the information from the relevant documents, the percentage of mandibular incisors with 2 root canals ranges from 10.9% to 37.9%. Therefore, the answer is A. 22-40%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 22-40%\"}"
