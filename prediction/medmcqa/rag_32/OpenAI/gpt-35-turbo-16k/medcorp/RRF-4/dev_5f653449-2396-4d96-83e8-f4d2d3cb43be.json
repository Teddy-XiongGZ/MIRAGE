    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of transfer of information from the RNA to the proteins is called translation. Translation is the process where the genetic information in mRNA is used to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence. This process occurs in ribosomes, where transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules recognize the codons in mRNA and provide the corresponding amino acids. The ribosome then links these amino acids together to form a protein chain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Translation\"}"
