    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine at what stage of embryonic development initial tooth development begins, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that primary teeth start to form in the development of the embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks. Document [2] also mentions that primary (baby) teeth start to form between the sixth and eighth weeks in utero.
