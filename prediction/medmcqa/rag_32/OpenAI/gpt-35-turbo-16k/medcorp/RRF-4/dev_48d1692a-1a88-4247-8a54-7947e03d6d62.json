    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the answer, we need to search for information about the optimal anti-rotational design in a blade. The relevant documents that may contain this information are Document [6] (Title: Mechanical evaluation of cerebral aneurysm clip scissoring phenomenon: comparison of titanium alloy and cobalt alloy), Document [8] (Title: The effect of different screw-rod design on the anti-rotational torque: a biomechanical comparison of three conventional screw-rod constructs), and Document [23] (Title: Screw-blade fixation systems for implant anchorage in the femoral head: Horizontal blade orientation provides superior stability). We will search for information about the optimal anti-rotational design and the maximum offset allowed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
