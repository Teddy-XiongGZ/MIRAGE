Let's analyze each statement:\\n\\nA. Transferrin saturation <16%: This statement is true. Transferrin saturation is a measure of the amount of iron bound to transferrin, and a value below 16% is indicative of iron deficiency.\\n\\nB. Detected by serum ferritin levels even in earlier states: This statement is true. Serum ferritin levels are a reliable indicator of iron stores in the body and can detect iron deficiency even in earlier stages.\\n\\nC. Mostly presents without any symptoms with abnormal laboratory findings: This statement is true. Iron deficiency anemia can often be asymptomatic or present with vague symptoms, but abnormal laboratory findings such as low hemoglobin and microcytic anemia are common.\\n\\nD.
