    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formation of the dental lamina is a band of epithelial tissue seen in histologic sections of a developing tooth. According to the documents, the dental lamina is first evidence of tooth development and begins at the sixth week in utero or three weeks after the rupture of the buccopharyngeal membrane. It is formed when cells of the oral ectoderm proliferate faster than cells of other areas. Therefore, the formation of the dental lamina is initiated by the oral ectoderm, which is derived from the ectoderm layer of the forming embryo. Neural crest cells are involved in tooth development but are not directly responsible for the formation of the dental lamina. Odontoblasts are responsible for the formation of dentin, not the dental lamina. Forebrain and Rathke's pouch are not mentioned in the context of dental lamina formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Neural crest cells\"}"
