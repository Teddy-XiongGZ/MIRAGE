    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In dislocation of the jaw, the displacement of the articular disc beyond the articular tubercle of the temporomandibular joint is caused by spasm or excessive contraction of a specific muscle. According to the provided documents, the muscle involved in this condition is the lateral pterygoid muscle. Document [0] mentions that the spasm of the lateral pterygoid muscle can result in trismus (locked jaw) and the involvement of this muscle can cause anterior dislocation of the disk. Document [5] also states that the lower head of the lateral pterygoid contracts during mouth closing, which can lead to anterior disc displacement. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Lateral pterygoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
