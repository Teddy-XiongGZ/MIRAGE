    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the Rinne's test shows air conduction greater than bone conduction on both sides, indicating a normal result. The Weber test lateralizes to the right ear, suggesting a conductive hearing loss in the left ear. Therefore, the next logical step would be to perform Schwabach's test to further evaluate the conductive hearing loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
