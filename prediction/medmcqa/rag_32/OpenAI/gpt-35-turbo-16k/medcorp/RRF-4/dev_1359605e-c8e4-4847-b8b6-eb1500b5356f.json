    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluoride substitution in hydroxyapatite crystals occurs by replacing the hydroxyl ion (OH-) with fluoride ion (F-). The question asks which ion substitution imparts more strength. To determine this, we need to analyze the relevant documents for information on the mechanical properties of fluoridated hydroxyapatite. Specifically, we should look for information on the influence of fluoride substitution on the strength or mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
