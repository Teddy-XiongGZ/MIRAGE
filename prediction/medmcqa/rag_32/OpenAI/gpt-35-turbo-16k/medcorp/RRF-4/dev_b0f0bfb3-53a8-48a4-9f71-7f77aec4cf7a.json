    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepatic first-pass metabolism refers to the metabolism of a drug that occurs in the liver before it reaches the systemic circulation. The first-pass effect can significantly reduce the bioavailability of a drug. To bypass hepatic first-pass metabolism, the drug needs to be administered in a way that allows it to directly enter the systemic circulation without passing through the liver. Based on the provided documents, the routes of drug administration that can bypass hepatic first-pass metabolism are sublingual, intravenous, and intradermal. Oral administration, on the other hand, involves the drug passing through the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, making it subject to first-pass metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Oral.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
