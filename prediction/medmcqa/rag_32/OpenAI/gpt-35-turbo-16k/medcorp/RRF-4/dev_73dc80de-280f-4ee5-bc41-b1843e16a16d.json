    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the most probable cause of the ulcer near the midline of the lower lip following a formocresol pulpotomy is leakage of formocresol on the lip. The formocresol pulpotomy involves the use of formocresol as a pulp dressing agent, which can be caustic and irritating to the surrounding tissues. If there was leakage of formocresol onto the lip during the procedure, it could have caused a chemical burn and resulted in the development of the ulcer. Lip biting by the patient, allergy to the anaesthetic solution, and pressure by the rubber dam frame are less likely to be the cause of the ulcer in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
