    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The statement in the assertion is true, as avascular necrosis of the distal pole of the scaphoid can occur after a scaphoid fracture. The reason provided is also true, as the blood supply to the scaphoid bone is predominantly from branches of the radial artery, which enter the distal tubercle and supply the distal pole. However, the blood supply to the proximal pole of the scaphoid is retrograde, meaning it flows from distal to proximal. This retrograde blood supply increases the risk of avascular necrosis in the proximal pole if the blood flow is disrupted by a fracture. Therefore, both the assertion and the reason are true, and the reason explains the assertion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
