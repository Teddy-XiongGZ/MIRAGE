    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that specific molecular markers for limbal epithelial stem cells are lacking. Document [1] states that ABCG2 is a stem cell-associated marker expressed in limbal epithelial cells. Document [7] also mentions that ABCG2 is a marker that identifies human limbal epithelial stem cells. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. ABCG2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
