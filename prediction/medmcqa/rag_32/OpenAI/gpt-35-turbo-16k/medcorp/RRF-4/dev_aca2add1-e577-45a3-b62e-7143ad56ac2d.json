    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the factors that affect the strength of a gypsum investment, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the compressive strength characteristics of selected investments, including gypsum-bonded investments. It states that the gypsum-bonded investment did not exhibit marked differences in strength as a function of either time or temperature. Document [5] also mentions that there is no correlation between the compressive strength of gypsum-bonded investments and the wet and dry compressive strength. However, document [8] provides more insight into the effect of burnout temperature on the strength of gypsum-bonded investments. It states that the strength of gypsum-bonded investment is temperature sensitive, and there are marked differences in strength between different products. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that the strength of a gypsum investment is not dependent on carbon content, silica content, or copper. The most relevant factor affecting the strength of a gypsum investment is the burnout temperature. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options, but it can be inferred that the strength of a gypsum investment is dependent on the burnout temperature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not provided in the options\"}"
