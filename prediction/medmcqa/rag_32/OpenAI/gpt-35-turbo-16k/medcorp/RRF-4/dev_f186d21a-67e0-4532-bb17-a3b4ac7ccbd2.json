    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the composition of Cobalt-Chromium alloys, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [3] states that different Cobalt Chromium alloys contain different amounts of alloying elements. Document [9] mentions that the alloy composition used in orthopedic implants is described in industry standard ASTM-F75, which mainly consists of cobalt, with 27 to 30% chromium, 5 to 7% molybdenum, and other trace elements. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. 30% cobalt and 60% chromium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
