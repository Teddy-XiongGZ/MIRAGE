    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The facial nerve is a cranial nerve responsible for innervating the muscles of facial expression. To determine its location, we can refer to the relevant documents. Document [4] states that the facial nerve exits the temporal bone through the stylomastoid foramen and enters the parotid gland. Within the parotid gland, it gives off two main trunks, the superior temporofacial and inferior cervicofacial trunks, which give rise to the parotid plexus. From this plexus, five branches emerge: the temporal (or frontal), zygomatic, buccal, mandibular, and cervical branches. These branches carry motor fibers to the facial muscles. Document [13] also mentions that the facial nerve travels extratemporally for approximately 14 mm before dividing into five main branches: frontal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical. Based on this information, we can conclude that the facial nerve is located below the SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) and above the parotidomassetric fascia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Below SMAS and below parotidomassetric fascia\"}"
