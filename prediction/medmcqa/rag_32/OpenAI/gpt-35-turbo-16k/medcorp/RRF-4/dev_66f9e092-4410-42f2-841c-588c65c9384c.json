    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mean and standard deviation can be worked out only if data is on an interval/ratio scale. Nominal scale data only allows for frequency counts and percentages, dichotomous scale data only allows for proportions, and ordinal scale data only allows for rankings. Interval/ratio scale data, on the other hand, allows for numerical values with equal intervals between them, which is necessary for calculating the mean and standard deviation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
