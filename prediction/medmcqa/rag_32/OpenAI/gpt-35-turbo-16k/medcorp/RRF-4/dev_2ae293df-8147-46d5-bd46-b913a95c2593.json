    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 70-year-old male presenting with amblyopia, exertional chest pain, episodic tachycardia, and extra systoles on ECG. To determine the probable cause, we need to consider the symptoms and potential risk factors associated with each choice. \\n\\nA. Cocaine poisoning: Cocaine use can cause tachycardia, chest pain, and visual disturbances, but it is less likely in this case as there is no mention of drug use.\\n\\nB. Chronic nicotine poisoning: Nicotine can cause tachycardia, but it is unlikely to cause amblyopia or exertional chest pain.\\n\\nC. Arsenophagia: Arsenic poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms, including visual disturbances, chest pain, and cardiac arrhythmias. However, there is no mention of exposure to arsenic in the patient's history.\\n\\nD. Cannabis ingestion: Cannabis use can cause tachycardia and chest pain, but it is unlikely to cause amblyopia.\\n\\nBased on the symptoms described, none of the options seem to be the probable cause. It is important to consider other potential causes, such as cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, or other underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing would be necessary to determine the exact cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
