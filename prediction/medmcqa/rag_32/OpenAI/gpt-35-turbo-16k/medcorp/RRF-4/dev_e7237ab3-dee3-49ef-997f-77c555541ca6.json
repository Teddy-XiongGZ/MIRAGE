    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old with painless progressive bilateral facial swellings. Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is cherubism. Cherubism is a rare hereditary benign lesion of the mandible that appears in childhood as bilateral painless swellings. It typically presents before puberty and spontaneously regresses after puberty. The characteristic radiographic findings of cherubism include multiloculated osteolysis involving the mandible and maxilla. The lesions are typically bilateral and symmetric. Monostotic and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia are other differential diagnoses for facial swellings, but they are less likely in this case as they typically present with unilateral lesions. Central giant cell granuloma is also a differential diagnosis, but it is more commonly seen in older children and adults and typically presents as a solitary lesion rather than bilateral swellings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
