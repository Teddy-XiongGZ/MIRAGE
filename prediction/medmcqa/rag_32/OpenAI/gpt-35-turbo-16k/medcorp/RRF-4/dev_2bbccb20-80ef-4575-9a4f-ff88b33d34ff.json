    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the false statement about Thyroglossal Duct cyst, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. According to the documents, Thyroglossal Duct cyst is a congenital malformation that occurs due to incomplete closure of the thyroglossal duct. It is the most common congenital neck mass in children and young adults. The cyst is typically lined by stratified squamous or pseudostratified columnar epithelium.
