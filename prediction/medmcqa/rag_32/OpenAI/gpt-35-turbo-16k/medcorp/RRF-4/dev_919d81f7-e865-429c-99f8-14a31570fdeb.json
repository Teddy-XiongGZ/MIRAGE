    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of scale that TNM Staging belongs to. To determine the answer, we need to understand the characteristics of the different types of scales. An ordinal scale is a scale that has ordered categories but does not have a consistent unit of measurement. A ratio scale is a scale that has ordered categories and a consistent unit of measurement, with a true zero point. A nominal scale is a scale that has unordered categories. An interval scale is a scale that has ordered categories and a consistent unit of measurement, but does not have a true zero point. TNM Staging involves the classification of tumors based on the size of the primary tumor, involvement of nearby lymph nodes, and presence of distant metastasis. These categories are ordered and have a consistent unit of measurement, but there is no true zero point. Therefore, TNM Staging is best classified as an ordinal scale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
