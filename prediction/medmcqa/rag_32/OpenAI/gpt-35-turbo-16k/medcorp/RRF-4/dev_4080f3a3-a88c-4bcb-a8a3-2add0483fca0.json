    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which score is used for wound infection, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions the ASEPSIS score, which is a scoring method for postoperative wound infections. Document [2] discusses the TILI score, which is a diagnostic tool for local wound infections. Document [3] introduces the W.A.R. score, which assesses the individual patient's risk of wound infection. Based on this information, the answer is either the ASEPSIS score, the TILI score, or the W.A.R. score. To confirm the correct answer, we need to review the other documents. Document [4] does not mention any specific score for wound infection. Document [5] is a general overview of wound assessment and evaluation and does not provide information about a specific score for wound infection. Document [6] evaluates wound infection after arterial surgery but does not mention a specific score. Document [7] discusses a wound scoring system for breast surgery but does not mention wound infection. Document [8] introduces the DISINFECT score for leg wound infections following cardiac surgery, but it is not specific to wound infection in general. Document [9] presents a wound score for diabetic foot infections but does not mention wound infection in general. Document [10] discusses the W.A.R. score for wound classification and antimicrobial treatment but does not specifically mention wound infection. Document [11] describes wound infections after cardiac surgery but does not mention a specific score for wound infection. Document [12] discusses the ASEPSIS score for postoperative wound sepsis but does not mention wound infection in general. Document [13] evaluates the use of the ASEPSIS score in postoperative wound surveillance but does not mention wound infection in general. Document [14] reviews the ASEPSIS scoring system but does not mention wound infection in general. Document [15] evaluates different wound classification systems but does not mention a specific score for wound infection. Document [16] discusses the ASEPSIS score in relation to wound infection after cardiac surgery. Document [17] introduces the wound bed score for predicting the risk of wound infection. Document [18] evaluates the ASEPSIS score in wound infection assessment after cardiac surgery. Document [19] investigates the relation between wound tissue oxygen tension and wound infection. Document [20] discusses the surveillance of wound infections but does not mention a specific score for wound infection. Document [21] emphasizes the importance of recognizing wound infection even when classic signs are not present. Document [22] reviews the quality of measurement of surgical wound infection but does not mention a specific score. Document [23] discusses surgical wound infection rates based on wound class, operative procedure, and patient risk index but does not mention a specific score. Document [24] highlights the lack of guidelines for determining wound infection and the indication for systemic antibiotics. Document [25] investigates wound infections from snake bites but does not mention a specific score for wound infection. Document [26] evaluates the agreement between different definitions of wound infection but does not mention a specific score. Document [27] identifies risk factors for wound infection after biliary tract surgery but does not mention a specific score. Document [28] discusses wound bed preparation and the importance of managing bacterial balance but does not mention a specific score for wound infection. Document [29] investigates the association between the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of physical status and wound infection but does not mention a specific score. Document [30] introduces the modified TIME-H scoring system for wound management but does not mention wound infection specifically. Document [31] describes the Wound Score system and its versatility for scoring various wound types, including diabetic foot ulcers. Based on this analysis, the answer is either the ASEPSIS score or the W.A.R. score. However, since the ASEPSIS score is specifically mentioned in relation to wound infection in multiple documents, it is the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
