    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Giant cell/Neonatal hepatitis is a condition characterized by the presence of giant cells in the liver tissue. To determine the condition that usually results in this case, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that neonatal giant cell hepatitis (NGCH) is an important diagnostic consideration in infants who present with jaundice. Document [3] reports a case of neonatal giant cell hepatitis (NGCH) presenting with acute hepatic failure.

Based on this information, it can be concluded that the condition that usually results in giant cell/Neonatal hepatitis is neonatal hepatitis itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
