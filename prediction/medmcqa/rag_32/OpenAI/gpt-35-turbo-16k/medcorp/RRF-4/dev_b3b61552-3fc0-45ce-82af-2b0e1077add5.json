    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the type of mandibular fracture managed by adapting mini plates. To answer this, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [4] mentions the use of 2.0 mm locking miniplates in the management of mandibular fractures without maxillomandibular fixation. Document [5] compares the internal fixation of mandibular fractures using rigid 2.7 mm AO/ASIF plates or mini-plates. Document [8] compares the clinical results between different methods of fixation of standard mini-plates for the management of mandibular angle fractures. Document [14] evaluates the treatment of mandibular fractures using intermaxillary fixation, wire fixation, and mini-plate fixation. Based on this information, it can be concluded that mandibular fractures managed by adapting mini plates are a type of rigid osteosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Rigid osteosynthesis\"}"
