    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the term 'embrasure' refers to the triangular-shaped spaces located between the proximal surfaces of adjacent teeth. The borders of embrasures are formed by the interdental papilla of the gingiva, the adjacent teeth, and the contact point where the two teeth meet.
