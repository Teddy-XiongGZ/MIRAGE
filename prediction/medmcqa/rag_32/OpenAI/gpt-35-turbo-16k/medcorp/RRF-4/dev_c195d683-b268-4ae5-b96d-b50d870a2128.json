    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cannula is used in a patient with severe dehydration and diarrhea, we need to consider the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions the use of intravenous fluid therapy (IVF) in patients with severe dehydration. Document [10] also mentions the use of endovenous rehydration in severely dehydrated patients. Document [13] discusses the use of rapid rehydration using intravenous fluids in children with moderately dehydrated acute gastroenteritis. Based on this information, it is clear that intravenous fluids are used in patients with severe dehydration and diarrhea. However, none of the documents specifically mention the use of a specific cannula for this purpose. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific cannula used based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
