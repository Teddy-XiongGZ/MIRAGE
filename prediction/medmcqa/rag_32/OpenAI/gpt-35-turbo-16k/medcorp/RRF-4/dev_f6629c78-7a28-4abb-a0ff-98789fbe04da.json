    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Poiseuille's Law, the flow rate of blood is directly proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the blood vessel. So, if the radius of the blood vessels is increased by 50%, we can calculate the increase in blood flow by taking the ratio of the new flow rate to the original flow rate. Let's assume the original flow rate is 1 unit. If the radius is increased by 50%, the new radius will be 1.5 times the original radius. According to Poiseuille's Law, the new flow rate will be (1.5^4) = 5.0625 times the original flow rate. Therefore, the rise in blood flow is approximately 5 times.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
