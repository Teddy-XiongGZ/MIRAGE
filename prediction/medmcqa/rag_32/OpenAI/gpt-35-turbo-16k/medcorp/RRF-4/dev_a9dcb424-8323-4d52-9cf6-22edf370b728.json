    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which joint histologically and morphologically best simulates the TMJ, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that sheep TMJ is anatomically similar to the human TMJ and should be considered as a prime model for TMJ research. Document [1] suggests that the upper joint cavity of pigs resembles the human TMJ best and may serve as a model for arthroscopic TMJ surgery. Document [2] proposes a model to simulate the human TMJ behavior based on interdependent joints topology. Document [3] focuses on improving the qualitative information that can be acquired from radiographs of the TMJ. Document [4] investigates the influence of distraction rates on the TMJ position and cartilage morphology in a rabbit model. Document [5] compares the histologic features of the costochondral, sternoclavicular, and temporomandibular joints in Macaca mulatta. Document [6] describes and evaluates the normal rat TMJ from an anatomical and histopathologic point of view. Document [7] examines morphological and biochemical changes in an experimental model of TMJ arthritis in rats. Document [8] predicts TMJ disc thickness and position changes for different jaw positions. Document [9] describes the histology of the rhesus monkey TMJ and compares it to the human joint. Document [10] compares the structural and ultrastructural organization of the TMJ between sheep and pigs. Document [11] characterizes the histologic changes associated with experimental partial anterior disc displacement in the rabbit TMJ. Document [12] reviews the biomechanical properties of the mandibular condylar cartilage and its relevance to the TMJ disc. Document [13] correlates histologic changes with stress developed by various disc interferences in the rabbit TMJ. Document [14] describes the anatomical modifications of the TMJ during aging. Document [15] discusses the observations on the spectra of normalcy in TMJ function and morphology. Document [16] investigates the biomechanical effects of maximal mouth opening on the TMJ and its relationship to morphology and kinematics. Document [17] studies the mechanics of the TMJ and its dysfunction and breakdown. Document [18] analyzes the temporomandibular joint loading patterns related to joint morphology. Document [19] explores hard tissue structural changes in TMJ morphology prior to orthodontic therapy. Document [20] proposes a standard protocol for histology and immunohistochemistry reactions in the TMJ of rats. Document [21] provides an introduction to joint anatomy. Document [22] discusses diagnostic imaging techniques for the TMJ. Document [23] applies SPHARM-PDM to quantify TMJ osteoarthritis. Document [24] describes the histology of cartilage. Document [25] examines the postnatal development of the TMJ in the common marmoset. Document [26] provides an introduction to joint anatomy. Document [27] compares the trabecular structure of the condyle in young and mature sheep. Document [28] analyzes the 3D reconstruction of the TMJ after resection of the cyst and stress-strain analyses. Document [29] tests the effect of hyaluronic acid on experimental TMJ osteoarthrosis in sheep. Document [30] discusses cartilage histomorphometry. Document [31] analyzes the variation of the TMJ intraarticular space during mastication. Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the joint which histologically and morphologically best simulates the TMJ is the sheep TMJ, as stated in Document [0]. Therefore, the answer is A. 5th costochondral graft.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
