    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the classification of a mandibulectomy defect, we need to refer to the relevant document that provides a classification system for mandibular defects. Document [7] titled 'A new classification for mandibular defects after oncological resection' presents a classification system based on the four corners of the mandible: class I (lateral), class II (hemimandibulectomy), class III (anterior), and class IV (extensive). Based on this classification system, we can determine the classification of the mandibulectomy defect. The Cantor Curtis class 2 defect falls under class II, which is a hemimandibulectomy defect. Therefore, the answer is B. lateral to canine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
