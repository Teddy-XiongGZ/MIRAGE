    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the treatment of choice for erythrodermic psoriasis depends on the severity of the disease at the time of presentation and the patient's comorbidities. Cyclosporine and infliximab are the most rapidly acting agents for the treatment of erythrodermic psoriasis. Acitretin and methotrexate are also appropriate first-line choices, although they usually work more slowly. Combination therapy, such as cyclosporine plus etretinate, may be considered for patients not responding to monotherapy. Topical treatments like coal tar and topical steroids may be used as supportive care, but they are not the primary treatment of choice for erythrodermic psoriasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
