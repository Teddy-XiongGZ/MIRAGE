    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the amino acid used in the estimation of collagen, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [3] mentions a method for determining the amount of COL III in the reticular dermis of parchments calculated from the ratio of Ile/Val. However, this document does not provide information about the amino acid used in the estimation of collagen. Document [5] discusses the use of the molar ratio Hyp to Hyl to differentiate collagen types I and II. While this document mentions hydroxyproline, it does not explicitly state that it is used in the estimation of collagen. Document [6] proposes a method for estimating the ratio of collagen type III to type I in soft tissues based on the ratio of Gly/Ala. This document suggests that the amino acid glycine is used in the estimation of collagen. Document [7] compares the qualitative composition of amino acids in different types of collagen and mentions that collagen contains high content of proline and glycine. Based on the information from these documents, it can be concluded that the amino acid used in the estimation of collagen is glycine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Glycine\"}"
