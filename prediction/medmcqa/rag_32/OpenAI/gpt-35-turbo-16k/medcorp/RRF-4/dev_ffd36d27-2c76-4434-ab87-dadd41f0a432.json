    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how far the gutta percha should be trimmed back before sealing the coronal area in a patient with gingival recession, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the drawbacks of gutta percha, including the lack of sealability. It mentions that the lack of seal on the coronal 1/3 and apical 1/3 portion is directly related to the failure of root canal treatment. However, it does not provide specific information about how far the gutta percha should be trimmed back. Document [3] discusses the effective removal of gutta percha in endodontic retreatment. It recommends removing gutta percha without solvents in the coronal two-thirds of canals as much as possible and with solvents in the apical third. While this document provides guidance on gutta percha removal, it does not mention the specific distance for trimming back the gutta percha before sealing the coronal area. None of the other documents provide information directly related to the question. Based on the available information, it is not possible to determine the exact distance for trimming back the gutta percha before sealing the coronal area in a patient with gingival recession.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
