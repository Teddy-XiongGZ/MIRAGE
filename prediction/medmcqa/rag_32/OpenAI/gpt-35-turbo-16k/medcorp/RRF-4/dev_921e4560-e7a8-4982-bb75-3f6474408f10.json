    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the common feature of all types of shock. Document [4] states that a severe mismatch between the supply and demand of oxygen is the common feature of all types of shock. This is further supported by Document [1], which states that shock is the process of oxygen demand becoming greater than oxygen supply. Therefore, the answer is not A (Vasoconstriction) or D (Bradycardia) as these are not common to all types of shock. Document [8] mentions that low blood pressure is a general sign for all types of shock, which aligns with the common feature of a severe mismatch between oxygen supply and demand. Therefore, the answer is B (Hypotension). C (Sepsis) is not common to all types of shock, as septic shock is a specific type of distributive shock. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
