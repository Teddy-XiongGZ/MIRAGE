    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 35-year-old male with well-defined bald patches and small broken hairs in the surrounding area. This presentation is consistent with alopecia areata, which is characterized by patchy hair loss with no scarring. Androgenetic alopecia typically presents with gradual hair thinning and a receding hairline, but not well-defined bald patches. Anagen effluvium is characterized by the sudden loss of actively growing hairs, usually due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Telogen effluvium is characterized by the excessive shedding of resting hairs, usually due to stress, hormonal changes, or certain medications. Neither anagen effluvium nor telogen effluvium present with well-defined bald patches. Therefore, the likely diagnosis in this case is B. Alopecia areata.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
