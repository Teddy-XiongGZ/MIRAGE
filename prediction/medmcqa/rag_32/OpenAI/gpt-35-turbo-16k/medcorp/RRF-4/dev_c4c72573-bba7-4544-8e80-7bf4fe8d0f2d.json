    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which instruments are required for tonsillectomy, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions the equipment required for tonsillectomy, including a Crowe-Davis or McIvor mouth gag, Allis clamp, no. 12 scalpel, curved Metzenbaum scissors, Fisher tonsil knife/dissector, Tyding snares, adenoidectomy curettes, and a St. Clair-Thompson adenoid forceps. Document [5] states that the most common instruments for total tonsillectomy in 2015 were monopolar electrocautery and coblation. Document [7] describes the technique of \"cold\" tonsillectomy using sharp dissection with a number 12 scalpel, Metzenbaum scissors, Fisher tonsil dissector, and Tyding snare. Document [13] compares two methods of tonsillectomy, including a dissection/snare technique and a suction-cautery method. Based on this information, we can conclude that the instruments required for tonsillectomy include a Crowe-Davis or McIvor mouth gag, Allis clamp, no. 12 scalpel, curved Metzenbaum scissors, Fisher tonsil knife/dissector, Tyding snares, adenoidectomy curettes, St. Clair-Thompson adenoid forceps, monopolar electrocautery, and coblation. The instruments not mentioned in the relevant documents are the Harmonic scalpel. Therefore, the answer is D. Harmonic scalpel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
