    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the maximum chance of perforation during post preparation in the distal canal of the mandibular first molar, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that most perforations and strippings occurred on the distal walls of mesial roots of mandibular molars. Document [2] evaluates the possibility of producing lateral perforation in distal canals of mandibular molars and states that statistically significant differences were found at the 'c' and 'd' levels in group 3 (#3 drill) without taking into account the root curvature. Based on this information, the maximum chance of perforation is seen on the distal surface of the mandibular first molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
