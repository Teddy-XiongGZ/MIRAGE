    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA methylation is a process by which a methyl group is added to DNA, and it is known to be involved in gene silencing and regulation of gene expression. Mismatch repair is a mechanism that corrects errors in DNA replication, and DNA replication itself is a process of copying DNA. Capping refers to the addition of a modified nucleotide to the 5' end of mRNA. Based on the information provided, DNA methylation is not directly related to mismatch repair, DNA replication, or capping. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Capping.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
