    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In full tooth borne dentures, occlusal rests are placed on the teeth for support. According to Document [0], a periodontally healthy tooth will be able to sustain its own load in addition to 1.5 similar teeth. This means that the occlusal load transmitted to the teeth is 1.5 times the load on a single tooth. Therefore, the percentage of occlusal forces transmitted to the teeth in full tooth borne dentures is 150%, which is equivalent to 100% of the occlusal forces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
