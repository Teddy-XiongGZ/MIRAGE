    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Electromyography (EMG) is a technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. It is used clinically for the diagnosis of neurological and neuromuscular problems. EMG measures action potentials created during muscle contraction and can be used to determine whether a muscle is active or inactive during movement, assess the velocity of nerve conduction, and measure the amount of force generated during movement. EMG is also used in research laboratories for studying biomechanics, motor control, movement disorders, and physical therapy. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. To study muscle activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
