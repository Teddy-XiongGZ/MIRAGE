    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common lesion of the mandible, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the most common malignant tumors of the mandible are SCCs of the oral cavity, notably carcinoma of the floor of the mouth and gingiva that invade the mandible secondarily. Document [7] mentions that the most common fibro-osseous lesion of the jaws is ossifying fibroma. Document [14] states that central giant-cell granuloma is the most common giant cell lesion of the jaws. However, none of these documents specifically mention the most common lesion of the mandible overall. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the most common lesion of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
