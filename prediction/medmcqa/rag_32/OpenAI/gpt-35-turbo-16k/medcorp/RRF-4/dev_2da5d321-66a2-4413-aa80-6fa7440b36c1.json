    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The distal palatal termination of the maxillary complete denture base is determined by the anatomical structures in the mouth. The vibrating line is the intersection between the soft and hard palate and is used as a landmark for extending the maxillary denture. The fovea palatine are concavities on the mucosa that can be seen as landmarks for the vibrating line. The tuberosity is the posterior region of the maxillary arch and is not directly related to the distal palatal termination of the denture base. The maxillary torus is a bony protuberance on the hard palate and is also not directly related to the distal palatal termination of the denture base. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Vibrating line.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
