    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the contents of the zone of stimulation. The zone of stimulation refers to the area where stimulation is applied and can lead to various physiological responses. Fibroblasts are cells involved in wound healing and tissue repair, so they can be present in the zone of stimulation. Osteoclasts are cells responsible for bone resorption, so they may not be present in the zone of stimulation. Osteoblasts are cells responsible for bone formation, so they may be present in the zone of stimulation. New bone formation can occur in the zone of stimulation as a result of the stimulation-induced bone remodeling. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Osteoclasts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
