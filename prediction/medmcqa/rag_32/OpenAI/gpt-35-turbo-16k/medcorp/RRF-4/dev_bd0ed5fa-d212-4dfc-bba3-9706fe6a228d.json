    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common location of intracranial neurocysticercoses, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] states that neurocysticercosis can occur in different locations, including parenchymal, subarachnoid/cisternal, intraventricular, and spinal. Document [4] also mentions that neurocysticercosis can be found in the brain parenchyma. Document [7] further supports this by stating that neurocysticercosis in the brain parenchyma is the most common form. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most common location of intracranial neurocysticercoses is the brain parenchyma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
