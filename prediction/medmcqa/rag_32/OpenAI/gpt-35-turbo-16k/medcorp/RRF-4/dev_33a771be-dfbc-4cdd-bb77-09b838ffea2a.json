Document [0] states that Apert syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis, midfacial malformation, and severe symmetrical syndactyly. Document [15] mentions that the craniofacial features of Apert syndrome include hyperacrobrachycephaly, steep wide forehead, flat occiput, ocular hypertelorism and proptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures, divergent upgaze and esotropic downgaze, a tendency towards large ears, marked depression of the nasal bridge, short and wide nose with a bulbous tip, and reduced anterior facial height. Document [14] specifies that the hand deformities in patients with Apert syndrome include a short thumb with radial deviation, complex syndactyly of the index, long and ring finger, symbrachyphalangism, and simple syndactyly of the fourth webspace.
