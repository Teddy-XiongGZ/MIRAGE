    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what the standard deviation of means measures. To answer this, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [4] states that the standard deviation of the mean is a measure of the precision of the mean obtained. It is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by a formula. Therefore, the standard deviation of means measures the precision or variability of the mean.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Sampling error\"}"
