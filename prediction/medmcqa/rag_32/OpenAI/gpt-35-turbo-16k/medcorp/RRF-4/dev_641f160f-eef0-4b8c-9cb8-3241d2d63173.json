    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most important prognosis factor for death in a child with acute liver failure, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the factors significantly correlated with death in children with liver failure were age, clinical type and stage of liver failure, decrease in prothrombin activity (PTA) and albumin (AIB) level, increase in serum level of total bilirubin (TBIL), appearance of deviation of TBIL and ALT, complications, and hepatic encephalopathy. Document [6] also mentions that INR, hepatic encephalopathy, and serum albumin (Alb) are major factors affecting the short-term prognosis of acute liver failure. Based on this information, the most important prognosis factor for death in a child with acute liver failure is likely to be increasing prothrombin time (PT) or INR, as mentioned in documents [2] and [6]. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increasing prothrombin time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
