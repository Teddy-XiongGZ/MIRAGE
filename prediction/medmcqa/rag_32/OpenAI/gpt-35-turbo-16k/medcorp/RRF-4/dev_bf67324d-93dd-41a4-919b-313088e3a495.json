    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine why lidocaine is used more commonly in dentistry, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that lidocaine is the most commonly used local anesthetic in dentistry. Document [1] mentions that lidocaine is one of the most commonly used local anesthetics in dentistry and can be administered in multiple ways. Document [16] states that lidocaine is the gold standard and most widely used local anesthetic in dentistry. Document [19] mentions that lidocaine has a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy, making it suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anesthesia. Document [27] compares 4% articaine and 2% lidocaine and shows that articaine achieved pulpal anesthesia more effectively than lidocaine. Based on this information, we can conclude that lidocaine is used more commonly in dentistry because it is widely available, has a rapid onset of action, and is effective for achieving anesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
