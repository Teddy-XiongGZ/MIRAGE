    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The upper denture falling when the patient opens their mouth wide suggests that there is an issue with the fit or design of the denture. To determine the cause, we can consider the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that over-extension in the sulcus around the maxillary molar region can cause mucosal trauma and displacement of the prosthesis. Document [7] discusses major connectors for upper teeth, and it mentions that plates, which have a lot of coverage, may not be well tolerated and can affect phonetics. Document [14] talks about the difficulty in establishing balanced occlusion inside the patient's mouth, which can affect the fit and stability of the denture. Based on this information, it is likely that the upper denture falls due to over-extended borders (B) or poor peripheral seal (D). However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact cause. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Over-extended borders\"}"
