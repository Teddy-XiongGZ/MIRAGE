    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cells are decreased in chronic periodontitis, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [27] states that plasma cells, naive B cells, and neutrophils are elevated in periodontitis tissues compared to healthy controls. Document [26] mentions that the presence of periodontitis and cancer synergistically increases T regulatory cells (Tregs) in peripheral blood. However, there is no specific mention of a decrease in any particular cell type in chronic periodontitis. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively determine which cells are decreased in chronic periodontitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
