    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myocardial infarction is defined as the irreversible death of heart muscle due to prolonged obstruction of blood supply to the organ. The major pathology in myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis caused by acute occlusion of a coronary artery. This is supported by several documents that mention necrosis, coagulative necrosis, and infarction as key features of myocardial infarction. Ischemia caused by dynamic obstruction of a coronary artery (choice A) and ischemia due to fixed atheromatous stenosis of one or more coronary arteries (choice C) are both related to the underlying cause of myocardial infarction, but they do not directly describe the major pathology. Altered conduction due to ischemia or infarction (choice D) is a potential complication of myocardial infarction, but it is not the major pathology itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
