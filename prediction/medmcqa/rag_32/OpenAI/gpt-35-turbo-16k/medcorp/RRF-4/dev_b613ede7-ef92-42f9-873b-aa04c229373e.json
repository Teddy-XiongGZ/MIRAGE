    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, dental plaque is formed by the reaction of enzymes on certain substances. Document [0] mentions that Streptococcus mutans uses the enzyme glucansucrase to convert sucrose into a sticky, extracellular, dextran-based polysaccharide that allows the bacteria to cohere, forming plaque. Document [14] also states that S. mutans uses the enzyme glucansucrase to convert sucrose into a sticky polysaccharide. Therefore, the correct answer is sucrose. None of the documents mention lipids or proteins as being directly involved in the formation of dental plaque. Saliva is mentioned in some documents as providing nutrients for the bacteria involved in plaque formation, but it is not directly involved in the enzymatic reaction that forms plaque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
