    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the treatment for infected mandibular angle fracture, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that infection is the most common complication of mandibular angle fractures, but it does not specify the treatment. Document [1] mentions that common complications of mandibular fractures include infection, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [2] discusses the surgical outcomes of patients with bilateral mandibular angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [3] states that closed reduction with intermaxillary fixation is used for mandibular angle fractures with a third molar in the line of fracture, but it does not specifically address infected fractures. Document [4] mentions that new three-dimensional plates have shown a reduction in postoperative infection rates for mandibular angle fractures, but it does not specify the treatment for infected fractures. Document [5] states that open reduction with one plate adaptation is generally the proper treatment method for mandibular angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [6] reports that older patients and patients who had a wisdom tooth extracted had a higher incidence of infection and plate removal, but it does not specifically address the treatment for infected fractures. Document [7] suggests that the presence of a wisdom tooth in the fracture increases the risk of infectious complications, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [8] discusses the use of a single upper border miniplate for mandibular angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [9] states that the presence of a tooth in the fracture does not affect the incidence of postoperative infection or the need for plate removal, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [10] reports a low infection rate for mandibular angle fractures treated with a 2.0-mm 8-hole curved strut plate, but it does not specifically address the treatment for infected fractures. Document [11] compares one-plate fixation and two-plate fixation for mandibular angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [12] describes a case of fungal infection and hardware failure following mandibular angle fracture treatment, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [13] evaluates the results of treating mandibular angle fractures with a single malleable miniplate, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [14] examines the effects of molar tooth involvement in mandibular angle fractures, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [15] suggests that the presence of mandibular third molars increases the risk of angle fractures, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [16] analyzes the association between the mandibular gonial angle and the risk of mandibular angle fracture, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [17] reviews the rate of postoperative infection in mandibular angle fractures with teeth in the fracture line, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [18] reviews the treatment and complications of mandibular angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [19] describes the treatment of mandibular angle fractures using a single miniplate ventral to the oblique line of the buccal cortex, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [20] analyzes the outcome and complications of mandibular angle fractures treated with two-miniplate fixation, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [21] reports the use of a 1.7 mm 3-dimensional strut plate for mandibular angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [22] analyzes the influence of the mandibular gonial angle on the occurrence of mandibular angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [23] evaluates mandibular third molars as risk factors for angle fractures, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [24] describes a case of iatrogenic mandibular fracture associated with third molar removal, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [25] discusses the treatment of mandibular angle fractures based on the principles of osteosynthesis, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [26] evaluates the treatment outcomes of rigid internal fixation for infected mandible fractures, but it does not specifically address the treatment for infected mandibular angle fractures. Document [27] evaluates the treatment of mandibular angle fractures using two noncompression miniplates, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [28] reviews the treatment of mandibular angle fractures and discusses the controversy surrounding the use of maxillomandibular fixation, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [29] analyzes the epidemiology, patterns, treatments, and outcomes of mandibular angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Document [30] reviews the management of bilateral angle fractures, but it does not provide specific treatment recommendations for infected fractures. Document [31] evaluates the efficacy of single miniplate osteosynthesis for angle fractures, but it does not mention the treatment for infected fractures. Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, there is no specific treatment recommendation for infected mandibular angle fractures. Therefore, the answer choice is not provided in the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information to determine\"}"
