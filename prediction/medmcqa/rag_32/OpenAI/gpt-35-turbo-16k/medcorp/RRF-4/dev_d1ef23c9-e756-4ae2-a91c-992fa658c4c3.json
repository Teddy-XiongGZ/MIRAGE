    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CSF rhinorrhoea is the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the nose. It is a potentially serious condition that can lead to complications such as meningitis. Immediate treatment is necessary to prevent further complications. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Antibiotics and observation: Antibiotics may be necessary if there is an infection, but they alone cannot treat CSF rhinorrhoea. Observation alone is not sufficient for immediate treatment.\\n\\nB. Plugging with paraffin gauge: Plugging the leak with paraffin gauge may temporarily stop the leakage, but it is not a definitive treatment and may not address the underlying cause.\\n\\nC. Blowing of nose: Blowing the nose is not a recommended treatment for CSF rhinorrhoea and may exacerbate the condition.\\n\\nD. Craniotomy: Craniotomy is a surgical procedure that involves opening the skull to access the brain. While it may be necessary in some cases, it is not the immediate treatment of choice for CSF rhinorrhoea.\\n\\nBased on the options provided, none of them are the immediate treatment of choice for CSF rhinorrhoea. The correct answer is not listed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
