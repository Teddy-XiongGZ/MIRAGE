    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the 90% confidence interval, we need to find the margin of error and then add and subtract it from the average GFR. The margin of error can be calculated using the formula: margin of error = 1.645 * (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size)). In this case, the sample size is 100, the standard deviation is 25, and the z-score for a 90% confidence interval is 1.645. Plugging in these values, we get: margin of error = 1.645 * (25 / sqrt(100)) = 1.645 * (25 / 10) = 1.645 * 2.5 = 4.1125. Therefore, the 90% confidence interval is 85 +/- 4.1125, which gives us a range of 80.8875 to 89.1125. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the range is 81 to 89.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 81-89\"}"
