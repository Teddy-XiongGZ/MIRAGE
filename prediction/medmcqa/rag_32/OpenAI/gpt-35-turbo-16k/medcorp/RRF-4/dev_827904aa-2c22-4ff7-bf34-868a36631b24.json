    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma are derived from B cells. Document [0] states that the establishment of a cell line derived from Hodgkin's disease indicates a B-lymphocyte origin of Sternberg-Reed cells. Document [2] further supports this by stating that Reed-Sternberg cells with B-cell phenotypes have rearranged immunoglobulin variable-region heavy-chain (VH) genes, indicating that these cells arise from B cells. Therefore, the answer is D. B cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
