    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the access cavity for mandibular first molars, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] discusses the importance of endodontic access in locating maxillary and mandibular molar canals. It mentions modifications to the traditional triangular access opening that make it easier to locate and instrument the fourth canal system commonly found in molar teeth. However, there is no specific mention of the shape of the access cavity for mandibular first molars. Document [7] provides information on the root and canal anatomy of mandibular first and second molars. It states that mandibular first molars normally have two roots and at least three main canals. Again, there is no mention of the shape of the access cavity. Document [12] discusses the effect of access cavity designs on the biomechanical behavior of endodontically treated mandibular first molars. It mentions different access cavity designs, including traditional access cavity and conservative access cavity, but does not specify the shape of the access cavity. Based on the information provided in the documents, there is no clear indication of the specific shape of the access cavity for mandibular first molars. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unknown\"}"
