    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which study found that sugar restriction in the diet was beneficial in the presence of unfavorable hygiene, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. The documents do not directly mention the specific study that investigated the effects of sugar restriction in the presence of unfavorable hygiene. However, Document [0] discusses the influence of dietary sucrose on plaque formation and gingival inflammation, while Document [5] examines the influence of frequent sugar intakes on experimental gingivitis. Based on this information, it is likely that the study that found sugar restriction to be beneficial in the presence of unfavorable hygiene is related to dental health and gingivitis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is C. Vipeholm, as it is a well-known study that investigated the effects of sugar restriction on dental health.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
