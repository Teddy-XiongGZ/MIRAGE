    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which bone is better described as 'bat with extended wings', we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, is due to the upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). This suggests that the bone involved in wing development and elongation is likely one of the bones in the bat's digits. Document [6] provides further evidence by stating that the distal phalanges in bat wings are low density bone that contain collagen I and proteins associated with mineralization in bone. Based on this information, the bone better described as 'bat with extended wings' is the distal phalanges.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Nasal\"}"
