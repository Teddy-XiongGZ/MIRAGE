    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of preterm births and the fact that she is currently at 9 weeks gestation, it is important to assess the cervical length to determine if she is at risk for cervical insufficiency. Cervical length measurement by ultrasound (choice A) is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient. This will help identify if she has a short cervix, which may indicate the need for cervical cerclage (choice B) to prevent preterm birth. Complete bed rest (choice C) is not recommended as it has not been shown to be effective in preventing preterm birth. Abdominal cerclage (choice D) is typically reserved for cases of recurrent mid-trimester pregnancy loss and is not the first-line treatment for cervical insufficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
