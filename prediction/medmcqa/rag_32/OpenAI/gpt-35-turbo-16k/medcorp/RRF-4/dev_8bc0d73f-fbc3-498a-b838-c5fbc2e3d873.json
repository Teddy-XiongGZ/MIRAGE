    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, the major fimbrial structural component of P. gingivalis is Fim A. This is supported by multiple documents that mention FimA as the major protein subunit of the fimbriae in P. gingivalis. Document [0] states that Mfa1, the major protein subunit of the short fimbriae, is necessary for optimal coadhesion between P. gingivalis and S. gordonii. Document [2] also mentions FimA as the subunit protein of major (long) fimbriae, which is a well-known virulence factor. Furthermore, Document [8] reports that the presence of two different types of fimbriae expressed on the cell surface of P. gingivalis, and the involvement of FimA fimbriae in the invasion process and alveolar bone resorption in rats. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Fim A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
