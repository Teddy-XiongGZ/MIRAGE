    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the correct answer by eliminating the incorrect options. Option A is incorrect because there is no information suggesting that penicillin is inactivated by erythromycin. Option B is also incorrect because erythromycin can exert its effects intracellularly. Option C is incorrect because there is no evidence that erythromycin enhances \u03b2-lactamases activity. Option D is the correct answer because penicillin is only effective against growing cells, while erythromycin can target both growing and non-growing cells. Therefore, treating patients with both antibiotics at the same time would not be appropriate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
