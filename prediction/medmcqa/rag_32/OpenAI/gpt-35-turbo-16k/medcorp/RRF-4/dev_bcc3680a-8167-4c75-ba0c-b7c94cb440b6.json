    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To remove confounding, various methods can be used. Randomization is a method that can help remove confounding by distributing potential confounding variables evenly across study groups. Random selection is a method used to obtain a representative sample from a population, which can help reduce confounding. Matching is a method where individuals in different groups are matched based on certain characteristics, which can help control for confounding. Blinding is a method used to prevent bias in the study by keeping participants or researchers unaware of the treatment assignment. However, blinding does not directly remove confounding. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Blinding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
