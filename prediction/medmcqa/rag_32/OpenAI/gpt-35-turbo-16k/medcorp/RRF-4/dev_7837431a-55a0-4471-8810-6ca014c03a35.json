    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prolonged sodium channel inactivation refers to the sodium channels remaining in the closed or inactivated state for an extended period of time. Inactivation of sodium channels is an important process in nerve conduction as it allows for the refractory period, which is the time during which the sodium channels are unable to open and generate another action potential. Therefore, if sodium channel inactivation is prolonged, it would result in a longer refractory period. The refractory period is divided into two phases: the absolute refractory period, during which no action potential can be generated, and the relative refractory period, during which a stronger stimulus is required to generate an action potential. So, if sodium channel inactivation is prolonged, it would lead to a longer relative refractory period, which means that it would be more difficult to generate an action potential during this time. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Decreased relative refractory period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
