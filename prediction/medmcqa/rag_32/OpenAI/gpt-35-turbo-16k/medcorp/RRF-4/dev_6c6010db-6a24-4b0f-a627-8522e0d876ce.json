    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zinc oxide-eugenol cement is composed of zinc oxide and eugenol. To determine which component gives its strength, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. Document [0] mentions that modifications of zinc oxide-eugenol cement resulted in variations in physical properties, including retentive and compressive strengths. Document [3] states that the addition of bis-eugenol to zinc oxide-eugenol cement did not decrease its physical properties. However, document [14] mentions that zinc oxide-eugenol cement has the lowest compressive and tensile strength compared to other liners. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the component responsible for the strength of zinc oxide-eugenol cement is zinc oxide, as it is the main component of the cement. Eugenol, which is derived from oil of cloves, is not mentioned as a contributing factor to the strength of the cement. Therefore, the answer is B. Zinc oxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
