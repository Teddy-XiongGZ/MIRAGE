    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the shape of the lower 2nd molar, we need to find the relevant information about its morphology. We can search for descriptions of the lower 2nd molar in the provided documents. After reviewing the documents, we find that Document [9] (Marsh rice rat) describes the morphology of the lower molars. According to this document, the first lower molar is rounded at the front end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is elongated and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form the front edge of the molar. Based on this information, the shape of the lower 2nd molar is likely to be a Distorted '+' shape.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Distorted \u2018+\u2019 shape\"}"
