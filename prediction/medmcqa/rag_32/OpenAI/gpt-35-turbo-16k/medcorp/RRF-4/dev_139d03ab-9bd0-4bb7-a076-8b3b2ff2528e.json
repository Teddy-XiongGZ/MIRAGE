    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-linking fixatives are used to stabilize and preserve biological tissues by forming covalent bonds between proteins. Osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, and formaldehyde are commonly used cross-linking fixatives. Methanol, on the other hand, is not a cross-linking fixative. It is a precipitating fixative that reduces the solubility of proteins and disrupts their hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, the answer is C. Methanol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
