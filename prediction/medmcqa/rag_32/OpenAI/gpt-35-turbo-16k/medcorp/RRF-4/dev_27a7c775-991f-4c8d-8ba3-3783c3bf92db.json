We can find this information in the relevant documents that discuss drug dose adjustments in renal failure. We should look for specific drugs mentioned in these documents and see if they require dose reduction in renal failure. Once we have identified the drugs that require dose reduction, we can compare them to the given choices and determine which one does not require dose reduction in renal failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
