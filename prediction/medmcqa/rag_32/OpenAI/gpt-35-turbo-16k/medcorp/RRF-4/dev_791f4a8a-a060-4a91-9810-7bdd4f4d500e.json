    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the heart of a controlled trial. To determine the heart of a controlled trial, we need to understand the key components of a controlled trial. From the provided documents, we can see that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are mentioned multiple times. RCTs are considered the gold standard for controlled trials and involve the randomization of trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance. This randomization helps to reduce bias and ensure that the study groups are comparable. Therefore, the heart of a controlled trial is randomization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Randomization\"}"
