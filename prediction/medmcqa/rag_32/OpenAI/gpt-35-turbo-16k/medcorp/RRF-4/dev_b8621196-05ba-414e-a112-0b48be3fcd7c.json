    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which diuretic can be given in mild to moderate hypertension, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the treatment of mild hypertension can begin with either a diuretic or a beta blocker. Document [11] mentions that diuretics are effective in adult and elderly hypertensive subjects, independently of their race. Document [21] states that thiazide diuretics may be useful for mild CHF, but are typically used in severe CHF in combination with loop diuretics. Based on this information, the diuretic that can be given in mild to moderate hypertension is a thiazide diuretic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Thiazide diuretic\"}"
