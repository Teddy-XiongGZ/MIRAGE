    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the preferred type of prefabricated post preparation system in mandibular molars, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [7] discusses the management of grossly decayed mandibular molars and suggests that multisection post and core or single cast post and core with auxiliary post can be an effective design. Document [24] compares the fracture strength and failure pattern of endodontically treated maxillary premolars with different postendodontic restoration techniques and concludes that the insertion of a single post in the palatal canal could be a safer and more conservative choice. Document [25] states that premolars require the placement of a post in the majority of cases, and any remaining thin walls can provide additional ferrule and serve as an anti-rotation mechanism. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the preferred type of prefabricated post preparation system in mandibular molars is likely to be a single post placed in the canal, preferably in a conservative manner. Therefore, the answer is C. Tapered, passively cemented.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
