    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intensifying screens are used in extraoral radiography to increase the efficiency of X-ray detection. They convert X-rays into visible light, which is then captured by the film or digital sensor. This increases the sensitivity of the imaging system, allowing for lower radiation doses to be used while still producing diagnostic images. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Decrease radiation to patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
