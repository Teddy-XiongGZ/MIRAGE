    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which muscles have parallel oriented fibers, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss muscle architecture and fiber orientation. Document [0] states that parallel muscles have fibers that are parallel to the force-generating axis. Document [3] mentions that parallel muscles can be fusiform, strap, or fan-shaped. Document [15] provides examples of muscles with parallel architecture, such as the biceps brachii. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and B (Sartorius and Rectus abdominis) as they are mentioned in the documents as having parallel oriented fibers. Document [0] also mentions that strap muscles, such as the laryngeal muscles, are parallel muscles. Therefore, we can eliminate option C (Sternohyoid) as well. This leaves us with option D (Tibialis anterior) as the muscle that does not have parallel oriented fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
