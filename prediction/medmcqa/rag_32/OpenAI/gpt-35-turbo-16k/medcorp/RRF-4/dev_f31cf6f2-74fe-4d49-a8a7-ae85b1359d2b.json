    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described, the child developed a maculopapular rash on the jaw spreading onto the trunk, which cleared on the 3rd day without desquamation. Additionally, the child had tender post auricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy. Considering these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Rubella. Rubella typically presents with a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads to the trunk. The rash usually lasts for 3 days and fades in the same directional pattern as it appears. Postauricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy is also a characteristic feature of Rubella. Kawasaki disease is unlikely as it presents with a longer duration of fever, desquamation, and involvement of the extremities. Erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease) typically presents with a slapped-cheek rash and does not involve lymphadenopathy. Measles usually presents with a high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downward.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Rubella\"}"
