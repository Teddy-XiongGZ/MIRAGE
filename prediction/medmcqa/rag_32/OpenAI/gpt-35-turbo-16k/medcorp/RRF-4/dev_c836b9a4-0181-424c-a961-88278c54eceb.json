    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the cleaning method for base metal alloy, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the influence of different metal cleaning methods on the bond strength of resin bonding systems to a NiCr alloy. Document [1] mentions acid wash as a step in the metalwork process. Document [7] talks about pickling as a metal surface treatment using acid. Document [11] mentions pickling with acids like hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid to remove impurities from metal surfaces. Document [21] lists aluminum as a base metal alloy. Based on this information, it can be inferred that cleaning of base metal alloy is done using acid-based solutions like warm HCl or cold H2SO4. Sandblasting with aluminium oxide is not mentioned as a cleaning method for base metal alloy in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Warm HCl\"}"
