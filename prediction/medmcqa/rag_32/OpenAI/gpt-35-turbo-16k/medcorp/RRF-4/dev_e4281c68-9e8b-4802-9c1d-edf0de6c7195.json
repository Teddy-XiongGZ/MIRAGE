    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which diseases are infectious but not communicable, we need to understand the definitions of these terms. An infectious disease is an illness resulting from an infection, while a communicable disease is a disease that can spread from one person to another. Based on this information, we can eliminate diseases that are both infectious and communicable, such as measles and mumps, as they can be transmitted from person to person. Scarlet fever is also communicable as it can be spread through respiratory droplets. Tetanus, on the other hand, is an infectious disease caused by a bacterial infection but is not communicable as it cannot be transmitted from person to person. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Tetanus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
