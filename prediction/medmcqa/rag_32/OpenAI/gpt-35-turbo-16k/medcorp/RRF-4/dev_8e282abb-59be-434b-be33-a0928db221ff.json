    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the tertiary monoblock system of obturation of the root canal, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] discusses the creation of primary, secondary, and tertiary monoblocks using different materials. However, it does not specifically mention Resilon as a tertiary monoblock system. Document [7] mentions resin-based obturation systems, but it does not specify Resilon as a tertiary monoblock system. Document [2] discusses the use of MTA monoblock obturation technique, but it is not referred to as a tertiary monoblock system. Document [19] mentions Gutta Percha and Resilon as root canal filling materials, but it does not specify them as tertiary monoblock systems. Based on the information provided, it is not clear which option is the correct answer. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be determined from the given documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
