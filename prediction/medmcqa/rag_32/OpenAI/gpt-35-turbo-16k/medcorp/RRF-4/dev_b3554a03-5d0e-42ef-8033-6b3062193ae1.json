The main concern in this condition is the potential for airway obstruction. Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an alternate airway by making an opening in the trachea. It may be considered in cases of severe airway compromise or when other treatment options have failed. Microlaryngoscopy is a procedure that allows for visualization and removal of the papillomas using specialized instruments.
