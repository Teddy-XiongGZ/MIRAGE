    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the primary colonization of plaque is dominated by specific bacterial species. Document [1] states that the initial plaque development on nonretentive tooth surfaces in monkeys was primarily dominated by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Actinomyces viscosus. Document [2] also mentions that in canine plaque biofilms, the species with the highest relative abundance in the early stages of plaque formation were Bergeyella zoohelcum, Neisseria shayeganii, and a Moraxella species. Both of these documents indicate that the primary colonization of plaque is dominated by specific bacterial species, rather than facultative aerobic or anaerobic gram-positive or gram-negative rods or cocci. Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
