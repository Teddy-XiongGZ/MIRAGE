    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has inward deviation of both eyes, which suggests esotropia. To determine the cause and further evaluate the condition, several tests can be done. The forced duction test is used to assess the restriction of eye movement and can help determine if there is any mechanical restriction causing the inward deviation. The cover uncover test is used to assess the presence and magnitude of the deviation and can help determine if it is constant or intermittent. Fundus examination can provide additional information about the structure and health of the eyes. Therefore, all of the above tests should be done to fully evaluate the inward deviation of both eyes in the 18-month-old child.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
