    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the steady state plasma concentration of the drug, we can use the formula: Css = (infusion rate / clearance) * (1 - e^(-0.693 * t1/2)), where Css is the steady state plasma concentration, infusion rate is 1.6 mg/min, clearance is 640 mL/min, and t1/2 is the half-life of the drug (1.8 hours). Plugging in the values, we get: Css = (1.6 mg/min / 640 mL/min) * (1 - e^(-0.693 * 1.8)). Calculating this expression gives us the steady state plasma concentration of the drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
