    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the principle of rapid tooth separation is not explicitly mentioned. However, Document [0] discusses the biomechanics of the Kansal Separator, which is a device designed to separate teeth. Document [1] describes a surgical procedure for separating fused teeth. Document [6] discusses the use of distraction osteogenesis for rapid tooth movement. None of these documents specifically mention the principles of wedge or traction. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine the exact principle of rapid tooth separation. The answer is D. None.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
