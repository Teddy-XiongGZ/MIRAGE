    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can evaluate each statement to determine if it is true or false. \\n\\nA. Base lines differ depending on the endemicity of the disease: True. Document [15] states that the baseline titres for Widal test can vary among different populations in endemic areas.\\n\\nB. O antibodies last longer and hence is not indicative of recent infection: False. Document [6] mentions that early rising O antibodies are predominantly IgM in nature and are due to recent infection.\\n\\nC. H antigen cannot differentiate between subtypes: True. Document [6] states that H antigen is a mixture of IgG and IgM, and the IgM portion gets inactivated, leading to a fall in titre. It does not differentiate between subtypes.\\n\\nD. High titre value in a single widal test is not confirmative: True. Document [26] mentions that a single Widal test has a high false-positive rate and should not be used as a confirmatory test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
