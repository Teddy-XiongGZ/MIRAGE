    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Regeneration refers to the process of tissue repair and restoration. To determine which layer of cementum is formed during regeneration, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] states that the main types of cementum are acellular extrinsic fibres cementum (AEFC), cellular intrinsic fibres cementum (CIFC), and mixed stratified cementum (MSC) which displays both cellular and acellular cementum. Document [17] further explains that acellular extrinsic fiber cementum (AEFC) contains only extrinsic collagen fibers, while cellular intrinsic fiber cementum (CIFC) is thick and contains both extrinsic and intrinsic collagen fibers. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Cellular intrinsic fibre cementum, as it is the layer of cementum that contains both extrinsic and intrinsic collagen fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
