    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that mentions the PHP-M index is Document [4]. However, it does not provide information about the number of teeth selected for scoring of PHP-M. Therefore, we need to look for information in other documents. Document [1] mentions the Patient Hygiene Performance (PHP) index, which is similar to PHP-M. It states that the index was recorded for plaque and gingival health before and after each routine, but it does not specify the number of teeth selected for scoring. Document [8] also mentions the PHP index, but it does not provide information about the number of teeth selected for scoring either. Since none of the documents provide the specific answer to the question, we cannot determine the correct choice based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unknown\"}"
