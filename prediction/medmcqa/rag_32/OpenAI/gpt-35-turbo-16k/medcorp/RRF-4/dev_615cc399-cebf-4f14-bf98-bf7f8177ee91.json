    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lipoproteins are complex particles that transport lipids (fats) in the extracellular fluid. They consist of a central hydrophobic core of non-polar lipids, primarily cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, surrounded by a hydrophilic membrane consisting of phospholipids, free cholesterol, and apolipoproteins. The lipids carried by lipoproteins include free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides. The proteins in lipoproteins are apolipoproteins, which play a role in classifying the lipoprotein and participate in lipoprotein uptake and clearance. Therefore, the lipoprotein contains free cholesterol + phospholipid at the periphery, cholesteryl ester + fatty acid at the center, and proteins as apoproteins. Hence, the answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
