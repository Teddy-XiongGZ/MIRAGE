    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the maximum number of genes that code for receptors in the mammalian genome, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [28] states that the olfactory receptor (OR) family is one of the largest known mammalian gene families, with around 900 genes in humans and 1500 in mice. This suggests that the maximum number of genes that code for receptors in the mammalian genome is for odorants. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Odorants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
