    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the drug not used in H. pylori, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that high-dose proton-pump inhibitor-amoxicillin dual therapy is a promising alternative approach for H. pylori treatment. Document [4] states that the standard first-line therapy for H. pylori is a one-week 'triple therapy' consisting of proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Document [6] mentions that the new triple therapy with proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin is recommended for the treatment of H. pylori infection in Japan. Based on this information, it can be concluded that amoxicillin is used in H. pylori treatment. Therefore, the drug not used in H. pylori is Mosapride.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
