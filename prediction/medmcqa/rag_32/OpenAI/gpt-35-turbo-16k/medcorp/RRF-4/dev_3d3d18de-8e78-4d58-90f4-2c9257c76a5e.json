    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The document that provides information about different types of fractures and their associated deformities is Document [5] (Title: [Malunited supracondylar and condylar humeral fractures].). This document discusses varus deformity, valgus deformity, and complex deformity as important types of posttraumatic deformities of the distal humerus. It mentions that slight varus deformities are the result of purely lateral slip of supracondylar fractures or radial overgrowth after a lateral condylar fracture. Severe varus deformities occur after ulnar slip of the distal fragment following supracondylar fracture caused by a rotational deformity. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Supracondylar fracture of humerus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
