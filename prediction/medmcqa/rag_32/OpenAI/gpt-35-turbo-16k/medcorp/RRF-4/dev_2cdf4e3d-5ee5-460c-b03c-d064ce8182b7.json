    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bacteriocidal toxins are toxins that kill bacteria. To determine where bacteriocidal toxins are found, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] mentions that strain UT 0007 produces both bacteriocin and exfoliative toxin, which are extracellular proteins. Document [9] states that many bacterial toxins are proteins that are liberated from the organism by lysis. Based on this information, we can conclude that bacteriocidal toxins are found in the zone of contamination, which refers to the extracellular environment where the bacteria are present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
