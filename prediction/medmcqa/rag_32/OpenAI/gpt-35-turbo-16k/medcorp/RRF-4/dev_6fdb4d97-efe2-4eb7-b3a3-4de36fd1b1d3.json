    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is determined by multiple factors. Afferent arteriolar resistance and efferent arteriolar resistance play a role in regulating the GFR. Afferent arteriolar resistance affects the pressure and flow of blood into the glomerulus, while efferent arteriolar resistance affects the pressure and flow of blood leaving the glomerulus. Aerial pressure, on the other hand, is not directly involved in determining the GFR. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
