The documents mention various risk factors and causes of infective endocarditis, but there is no specific information about the frequency of infective endocarditis in relation to mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, VSD (ventricular septal defect), or ASD (atrial septal defect). Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine which condition is least common in infective endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
