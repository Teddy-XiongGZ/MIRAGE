    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the information provided, the patient is a 19-year-old with a swelling over the left angle of the mandible, a temperature of 38\u00b0C, and no history of trauma. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is an infection. Among the given options, pericoronal infection is the most likely cause. Pericoronal infection refers to an infection that occurs around the crown of a partially erupted tooth, typically the third molar or wisdom tooth. It can present with swelling, pain, and fever. Spontaneous fracture of the mandible is less likely as there is no history of trauma. Mumps is also less likely as it typically presents with bilateral parotid gland swelling, not a localized swelling over the mandible. Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune condition that primarily affects the salivary glands and is unlikely to present with a localized swelling over the mandible. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is pericoronal infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
