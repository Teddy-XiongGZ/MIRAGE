    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most metabolically active layer in the bone. To determine the answer, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that cancellous bone has a greater rate of metabolic activity compared to cortical bone. Document [6] mentions that bone is a metabolically active connective tissue and that bone cells, including osteoblasts and osteocytes, are involved in bone metabolism. Based on this information, we can conclude that the most metabolically active layer in the bone is likely the cancellous bone, which contains a greater rate of metabolic activity compared to cortical bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
