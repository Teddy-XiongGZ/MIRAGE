    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Superelastic NiTi wires have the ability to recover their original shape after deformation, which means they have a high spring back in bending. On the other hand, non-superelastic NiTi wires do not have this ability and therefore have a lower spring back in bending. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Spring back in bending is much lesser for superelastic NiTi wires than non-superelastic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
