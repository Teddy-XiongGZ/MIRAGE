    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gait apraxia is a gait disorder characterized by an inability to initiate or perform normal walking despite preserved muscle strength. It is often associated with lesions in the frontal lobe or basal ganglia. Looking at the relevant documents, we can see that gait apraxia is mentioned in Document [0], [1], [3], [6], [7], [8], [11], [14], [21], [22], [23], [28], [30], and [31]. None of these documents specifically mention thromboembolic episodes. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific artery involved in gait apraxia based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information to determine the answer\"}"
