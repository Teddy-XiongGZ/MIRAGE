    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the main cause of RPD failure, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] discusses the risk factors related to failure of RPDs and identifies the main reason for RPD failure as the loss of abutment teeth, followed closely by poor fit and adaptation. Document [2] also mentions that the most common failure criterion for RPDs is abutment retreatment. Based on this information, we can conclude that the main cause of RPD failure is the loss of abutment teeth. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
