    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 45-year-old with pain in the abdomen and menorrhagia. The sonogram of the uterus showed a diffusely enlarged uterus with no adnexal mass. The endometrial biopsy was normal. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is adenomyosis. Adenomyosis is a condition where the endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, causing the uterus to become enlarged and tender. It can cause symptoms such as pelvic pain and heavy menstrual bleeding. Fibroid uterus is a possibility, but the absence of an adnexal mass makes it less likely. Endometritis is inflammation of the endometrium, which would typically present with other symptoms such as fever and abnormal vaginal discharge. Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which would not explain the diffusely enlarged uterus seen on sonogram.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Adenomyosis\"}"
