    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To diagnose the ECG, we need to analyze the relevant documents that provide information about ECG interpretation and diagnosis. Document [5] mentions that ECGs can be interpreted based on patterns, and Document [20] explains that the theory of ECG interpretation is rooted in electromagnetics. Document [17] states that the ECG is used to detect ischemia or acute coronary injury. Document [13] mentions that an ECG can be used to rule out other causes of chest pain, including myocardial infarction. Document [24] states that the initial diagnostic assessment for athletes and syncope patients includes an ECG, which can indicate structural abnormalities. Based on this information, we can conclude that the diagnosis of the ECG cannot be determined without further information or specific ECG findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
