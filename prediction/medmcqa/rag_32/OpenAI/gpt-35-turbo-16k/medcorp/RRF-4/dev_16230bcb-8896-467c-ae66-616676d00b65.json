    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, we can find information about the detection of the second mesiobuccal (MB2) canal in maxillary first molars. Document [0] states that the use of magnification loupes enhanced the detection of the MB2 canal in 50.9% of the permanent maxillary first molars. Document [2] also mentions that the use of a dental operating microscope (DOM) increased the detection rate of the MB2 canal. However, there is no specific percentage mentioned in the documents for the detection of the MB2 canal with naked eyes. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of cases in which the MB2 canal can be seen from naked eyes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
