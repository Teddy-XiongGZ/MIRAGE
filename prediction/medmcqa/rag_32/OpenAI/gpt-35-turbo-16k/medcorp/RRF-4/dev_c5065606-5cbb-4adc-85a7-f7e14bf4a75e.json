    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there are several mechanisms involved in cell membrane repair. One of the mechanisms mentioned is the repair of membrane damage through an active process involving hydrolysis of ATP. This is supported by Document [4], which discusses the active role of the cytoplasm in resealing a disrupted plasma membrane. It states that cytoplasmic vesicles are joined with one another and with the surrounding plasma membrane through exocytosis, adding internal membrane to the cell surface membrane at the site of disruption. This process is ATP-dependent. Therefore, the correct answer is D. An active process involving hydrolysis of ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
