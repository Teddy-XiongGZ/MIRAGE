    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Occlusion refers to the contact between teeth when the jaws close, such as during chewing or at rest. To determine the type of contact in occlusion, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [5] states that in an optimal functional occlusion, there should be even and simultaneous contacts of all posterior teeth when the mouth is closed. This suggests that the contact in occlusion is not limited to just the cusps or edges of the teeth, but rather involves surface-to-surface contact. Therefore, the answer is D. Surface-to-surface contact.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
