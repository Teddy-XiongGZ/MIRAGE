    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following statements is not true regarding the trigeminal nerve, we need to analyze each statement individually based on the information provided in the documents. \\n\\nA. Roots of trigeminal nerve are attached to Pons: This statement is true. Document [14] states that the trigeminal nerve contains three sensory nuclei, including the mesencephalic nucleus, principal sensory nucleus, and spinal nucleus, which are located in the brainstem.\\n\\nB. It has three main divisions: This statement is true. Document [10] mentions that the trigeminal nerve contains three terminal branches: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) nerves.\\n\\nC. Trigeminal nerve supplies the dura mater of middle cranial fossa: There is no information provided in the documents regarding the trigeminal nerve supplying the dura mater of the middle cranial fossa. Therefore, we cannot determine the accuracy of this statement.\\n\\nD. The trigeminal ganglion contributes to the sensory root only: This statement is not true. Document [29] states that the trigeminal ganglion contains both afferent and efferent fibers, which innervate structures of the lower jaw and face, as well as the muscles of mastication. Therefore, the trigeminal ganglion contributes to both the sensory and motor functions of the trigeminal nerve.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, statement D is not true regarding the trigeminal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
