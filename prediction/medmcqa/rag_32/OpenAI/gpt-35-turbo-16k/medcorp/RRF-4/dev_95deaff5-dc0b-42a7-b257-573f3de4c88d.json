    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peak bone mass is typically reached in the early 20s in females. After peak bone mass is attained, bone density gradually declines with age. Therefore, it is recommended to start bone mineral density testing before peak bone mass is reached, which would be before the early 20s. Based on the information provided in the documents, it is reasonable to start bone mineral density testing in females after the age of 18, as this is when peak bone mass is typically reached. Therefore, the best age to start bone mineral density testing in females would be after 18 years of age. None of the given options (A, B, C, D) accurately reflect this information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
