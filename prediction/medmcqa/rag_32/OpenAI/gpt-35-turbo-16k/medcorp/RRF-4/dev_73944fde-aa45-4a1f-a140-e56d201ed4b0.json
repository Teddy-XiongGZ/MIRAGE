    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the accuracy of each statement as follows:\\n\\n1. The documents do not provide specific information about CPR technique in relation to rib fractures, so we cannot determine the accuracy of this statement. Therefore, statement a is indeterminate.\\n\\n2. According to the documents, the compression-to-ventilation ratio for adults can be either 30:2 or 15:2, depending on the number of rescuers present. Therefore, statement b is true.\\n\\n3. The documents state that the compression-to-ventilation ratio for infants changes from 30:2 to 15:2 when a second rescuer arrives. Therefore, statement c is true.\\n\\n4. The documents mention that the recommended compression rate for adults is 100-120 compressions per minute, but there is no specific mention of the compression rate for infants. Therefore, statement d is false.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. a, c, d are true & b is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
