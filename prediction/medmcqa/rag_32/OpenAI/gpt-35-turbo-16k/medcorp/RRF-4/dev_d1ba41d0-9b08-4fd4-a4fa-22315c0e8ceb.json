    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the properties of myelinated nerve fibers. Myelinated fibers conduct action potentials faster than unmyelinated fibers. The myelin sheath is composed of lipids and acts as an insulator, allowing for saltatory conduction where the current discharges at the nodes of Ranvier. Therefore, options A, B, and C are all true statements about myelinated nerve fibers. However, depolarization does not occur only at nodes of Ranvier. Action potentials are generated at the nodes of Ranvier, but the depolarization spreads passively along the myelinated fiber between the nodes. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Depolarization occurs along the entire length of the myelinated fiber, not just at the nodes of Ranvier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
