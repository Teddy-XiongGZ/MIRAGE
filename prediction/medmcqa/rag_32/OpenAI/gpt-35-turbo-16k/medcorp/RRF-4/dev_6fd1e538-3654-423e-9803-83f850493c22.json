    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At resting membrane potential, the membrane potential is determined by the equilibrium potentials of the ions that the membrane is permeable to. In this case, the equilibrium potentials of X and Y are -30mV and -40mV respectively. If a drug is infused that blocks the permeability of Z, it means that Z will no longer contribute to the membrane potential. Since Z is not contributing to the membrane potential, there will be no change in the membrane potential. Therefore, the answer is C. No change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
