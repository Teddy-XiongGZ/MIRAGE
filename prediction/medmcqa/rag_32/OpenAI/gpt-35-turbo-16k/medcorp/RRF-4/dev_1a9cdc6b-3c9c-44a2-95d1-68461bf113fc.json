    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the reason why the injured nerve is not able to regenerate. To answer this, we need to consider the factors that inhibit nerve regeneration. A. Lack of endoneural tubes refers to the tubes that guide regenerating nerve fibers during the process of nerve regeneration. If these tubes are lacking, it would hinder nerve regeneration. B. Lack of growth factors can also inhibit nerve regeneration as growth factors are necessary for the growth and survival of nerve cells. C. Presence of glial scar is a common response to spinal cord injury and it forms a physical barrier that inhibits nerve regeneration. D. Lack of myelin inhibiting substance would actually promote nerve regeneration as myelin inhibiting substances prevent nerve regeneration. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
