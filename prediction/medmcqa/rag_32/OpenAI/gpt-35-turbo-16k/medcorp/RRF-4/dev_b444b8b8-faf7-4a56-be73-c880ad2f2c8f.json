    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mandibular stabilization is primarily governed by the facial nerve contraction. The facial muscles, which are innervated by the facial nerve, play a crucial role in controlling facial expression and movement, including the movement of the mandible. Therefore, in conditions where mandibular stabilization is required, it is likely that facial nerve contraction is involved. Among the given options, the condition in which mandibular stabilization is not governed by facial nerve contraction is the mature swallow. During a mature swallow, the mandible is stabilized by the muscles of mastication and the suprahyoid muscles, not by the facial muscles. Therefore, the answer is B. Mature swallow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
