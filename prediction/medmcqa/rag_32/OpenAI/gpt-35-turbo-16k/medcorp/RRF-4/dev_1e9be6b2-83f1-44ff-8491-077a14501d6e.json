    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Kraissl's lines are a set of anatomical skin lines that are the lines of maximum skin tension. They differ from Langer's lines, which are defined in terms of collagen orientation. Document [1] mentions that Kraissl's lines have been defined in living individuals and the method used to identify them is not traumatic. Document [3] further explains that the collagen fibers underlying Kraissl's lines are paralleling the lines and at the same direction, while the elastic fibers underlying Kraissl's lines are perpendicular to the lines. Based on this information, the answer choice that best describes Kraissl's lines is D. Relaxed tension lines in skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
