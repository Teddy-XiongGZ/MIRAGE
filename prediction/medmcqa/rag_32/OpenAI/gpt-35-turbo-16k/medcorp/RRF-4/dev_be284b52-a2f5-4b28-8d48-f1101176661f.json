    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can evaluate each statement to determine if it is true or false. \\n\\nA. B. fragilis is the most frequent anaerobe isolated from clinical samples: True. Document [4] states that the B. fragilis group is the most commonly isolated Bacteroidaceae in anaerobic infections, especially those that originate from the gastrointestinal microbiota. B. fragilis is the most prevalent organism in the B. fragilis group, accounting for 41% to 78% of the isolates of the group.\\n\\nB. B. fragilis is sensitive to metronidazole: True. Document [22] states that metronidazole is one of the antimicrobial agents that is active against >99% of clinical isolates of Bacteroides.\\n\\nC. The lipopolysaccharide formed by B. fragilis is structurally & functionally different from conventional endotoxin: True. Document [0] states that although B. fragilis is gram negative, it has an altered LPS and does not cause endotoxic shock.\\n\\nD. Shock & DIC are common in Bacteroides bacteremia: False. There is no information in the provided documents to support this statement. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
