    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true, we need to analyze each statement and find evidence in the relevant documents. \\n\\nA. Ankle brachial index < 0.5 indicates critical limb ischemia: There is no information in the documents that directly supports or refutes this statement. \\n\\nB. The ankle-brachial index is different at rest than that during exercise: Document [0] mentions that an ankle-brachial index is mandatory for the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, but it does not specify whether the index is different at rest and during exercise. \\n\\nC. L-arginine is useful for providing endothelium-independent vasorelaxation: There is no information in the documents about the use of L-arginine for providing endothelium-independent vasorelaxation. \\n\\nD. Smoking has a greater association with peripheral vascular disease than coronary vascular disease: Document [6] mentions that macrovascular disease, which includes peripheral vascular disease, is more closely associated with type 2 diabetes than type 1 diabetes. This suggests that peripheral vascular disease may have a greater association with smoking than coronary vascular disease. \\n\\nBased on the information in the documents, statement C is the only one that is not supported. Therefore, the answer is C. L-arginine is useful for providing endothelium-independent vasorelaxation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
