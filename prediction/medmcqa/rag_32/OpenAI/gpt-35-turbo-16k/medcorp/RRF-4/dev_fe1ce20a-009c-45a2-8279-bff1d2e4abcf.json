    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartile, we need to determine the range of blood pressures that fall within these quartiles. The 3rd quartile represents the upper 25% of the data, and the 4th quartile represents the upper 50% of the data. Since the data is sorted in ascending order, the 3rd quartile is the maximum value of the lower 25% of the data, and the 4th quartile is the maximum value of the upper 50% of the data. Therefore, the range of blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartile is from the maximum value of the lower 25% to the maximum value of the upper 50%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
