    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that there are three types of intrafusal fibres: typical bag, intermediate bag, and chain fibres. Document [7] mentions that static gamma axons innervate both bag2 and chain fibres, while dynamic gamma axons innervate bag1 fibres. Document [21] states that static gamma axons activate either chain fibres or bag2 fibres in every spindle they supply. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is C. Secondary endings are excited by chain fibres only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
