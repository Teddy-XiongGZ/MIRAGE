Document [0] mentions that the most frequent tumors of the endocrine pancreas are insulinoma, gastrinoma, and non-functioning tumors. Document [8] states that most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are nonfunctioning, but up to one third of PNETs can secrete a variety of peptide hormones, including insulin, gastrin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and somatostatin.
