    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A bilirubin level of 40 mg/dL in a patient with obstructive jaundice suggests a complete obstruction of the common bile duct. Obstruction of the common bile duct prevents the flow of bile from the liver to the intestines, leading to the accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream. This can result in significantly elevated bilirubin levels, such as 40 mg/dL. Malignant obstruction may also cause elevated bilirubin levels, but the question does not provide any information suggesting malignancy. Renal failure and liver failure may contribute to jaundice, but they are not the primary cause of obstructive jaundice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
