    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the complication of massive blood transfusion, we need to review the relevant documents for information on the potential complications. Document [2] discusses the possible complications of massive bleeding after major trauma, including coagulation abnormalities, complications related to blood storage, immunosuppression and infection, lung injury associated with transfusion, and hypothermia. Document [7] mentions that massive transfusions have numerous potential complications, but it does not specify the exact complications. Document [8] states that massive blood transfusion is associated with a wide range of adverse effects, but it does not provide specific details. Document [10] mentions acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion-associated sepsis, anaphylactic transfusion reaction, and hypotensive transfusion reaction as complications of transfusion, but it does not specify if they are specific to massive blood transfusion. Based on the available information, it is difficult to determine the exact complication of massive blood transfusion. However, since none of the provided options are mentioned in the relevant documents as specific complications of massive blood transfusion, it is reasonable to conclude that none of the options are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
