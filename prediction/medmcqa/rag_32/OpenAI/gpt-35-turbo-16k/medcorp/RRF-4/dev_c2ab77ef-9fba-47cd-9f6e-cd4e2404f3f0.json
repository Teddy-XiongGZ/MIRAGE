    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the temperature at which bone necrosis occurs during implant drilling is not explicitly mentioned. However, several documents mention that temperatures exceeding 47\u00b0C or 50\u00b0C can lead to thermal necrosis and compromise the osseointegration process. Therefore, the answer choice that is closest to these temperature thresholds is C. 45\u00b0C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
