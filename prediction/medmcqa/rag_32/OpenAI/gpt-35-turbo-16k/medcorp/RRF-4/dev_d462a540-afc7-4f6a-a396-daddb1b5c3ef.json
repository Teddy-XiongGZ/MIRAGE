    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the prevention of cervical resorption after bleaching, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] suggests that to avoid cervical resorption, the cervical area of the tooth should be covered with a base to prevent resorption. Document [2] mentions that high concentrations of bleaching agents should be avoided to reduce the risk of cervical root resorptions. Document [7] states that an intermediate dental base should be placed to prevent resorption. Document [16] also mentions that an intermediate dental base should be used with due respect to the attachment level. Based on this information, the most appropriate answer choice is D. Sodium perborate + calcium hydroxide, as calcium hydroxide is commonly used as an intermediate dental base to prevent cervical resorption after bleaching.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
