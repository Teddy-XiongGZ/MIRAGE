    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anterior division of the mandibular nerve gives off branches to three major muscles of mastication and a buccal branch which is sensory to the cheek. The posterior division gives off three main sensory branches, the auriculotemporal, lingual, and inferior alveolar nerves and motor fibers to supply mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Therefore, the anterior division of the mandibular nerve has both motor and sensory branches.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. One motor and all sensory branches\"}"
