    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardiac pain can be transmitted to the jaw due to the overlapping of sensory nerves. The trigeminal nerve (5th cranial nerve) is responsible for sensation in the face and jaw. The cervical nerves, specifically the third cervical nerve (C3) and the second cervical nerve (C2), innervate the neck and can contribute to referred pain. The first thoracic nerve (T1) is also involved in the transmission of cardiac pain. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: 5th cranial nerve, second cervical nerve, and first thoracic nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
