    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epithelial lining is a characteristic feature of various body structures and organs. To determine which option is not typically associated with an epithelial lining, we need to examine each choice. \\n\\nA. Sinuses: Sinuses are air-filled cavities in the skull that are lined with a specialized type of epithelium called respiratory epithelium. Therefore, sinuses are typically lined with an epithelial lining.\\n\\nB. Fistulae: Fistulae are abnormal connections or passageways between two organs or structures. The lining of fistulae can vary depending on the organs involved, but it is possible for them to be lined with epithelial cells.\\n\\nC. Aneurismal bone cysts: Aneurismal bone cysts are benign bone tumors that typically do not have an epithelial lining. They are composed of blood-filled spaces surrounded by fibrous tissue and giant cells.\\n\\nD. Keratocytes: Keratocytes are a type of corneal cell found in the eye. The cornea is covered by a specialized type of epithelium called corneal epithelium. Therefore, keratocytes are typically associated with an epithelial lining.\\n\\nBased on this information, the option that is not typically associated with an epithelial lining is C. Aneurismal bone cysts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
