    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the characteristics of dengue shock syndrome, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [2] states that grade III of dengue fever is the clinical evidence of shock, and Document [15] mentions that shock syndrome in dengue infection is associated with high mortality. Document [22] describes the clinical features of severe dengue, including shock, low pulse pressure, cyanosis, hepatomegaly, pleural effusions, and ascites. Document [25] also mentions that shock and hemorrhage occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue. Based on this information, we can conclude that dengue shock syndrome is characterized by hepatomegaly, pleural effusion, and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the answer choice D. Decreased haemoglobin is the correct answer as it is not mentioned as a characteristic of dengue shock syndrome in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
