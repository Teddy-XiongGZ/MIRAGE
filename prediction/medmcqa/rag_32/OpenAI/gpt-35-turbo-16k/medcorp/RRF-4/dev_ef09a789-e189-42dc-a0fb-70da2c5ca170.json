    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best finish line for an anterior metal ceramic crown, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that metal frameworks with 0.5 mm and 1 mm short of the finish line are recommended for anterior metal ceramic restoration. Document [5] mentions that rounded shoulder finish lines exhibited significantly better marginal adaptation than chamfer finish lines. Document [7] suggests that the accepted marginal design for ceramic jacket crowns is the 90 degrees full shoulder with a rounded gingival-axial line angle or a deep chamfer. Based on this information, the best finish line for an anterior metal ceramic crown would be a rounded shoulder or a deep chamfer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Chamfer with bevel\"}"
