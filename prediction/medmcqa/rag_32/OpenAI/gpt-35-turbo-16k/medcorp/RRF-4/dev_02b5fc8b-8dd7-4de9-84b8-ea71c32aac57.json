    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed generalized peeling of the skin after taking anti-epileptics, which suggests a drug reaction. The timing of one month after starting the medication is consistent with a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Among the given options, fixed drug eruption is a type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction characterized by recurrent, well-demarcated, erythematous patches or plaques that appear at the same site with each exposure to the drug. Pemphigus, Steven Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe blistering disorders that typically present with mucosal involvement and widespread skin detachment. However, the presentation of generalized peeling of the skin in this case is not consistent with pemphigus, SJS, or TEN. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is A. Fixed drug eruption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
