    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the effects of betamethasone administration to a mother with premature delivery. We know that betamethasone helps lung maturity and can reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in neonates. It is also associated with a reduction in the severity of RDS and a lower incidence of grades 3 and 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). However, there is no information suggesting that betamethasone administration prevents hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Decreases intraventricular hemorrhage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
