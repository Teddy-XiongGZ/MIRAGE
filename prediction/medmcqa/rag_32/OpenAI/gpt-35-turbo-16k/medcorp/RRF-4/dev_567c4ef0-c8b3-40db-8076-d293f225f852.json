    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tricuspid Atresia is a congenital heart defect characterized by the absence of the tricuspid valve, resulting in no communication between the right atrium and ventricle. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Left Axis deviation: Tricuspid Atresia is associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, which can cause right axis deviation, not left axis deviation. Therefore, option A is a characteristic feature of Tricuspid Atresia.\\n\\nB. Right ventricular hypoplasia: Tricuspid Atresia is characterized by a hypoplastic or absent right ventricle. Therefore, option B is a characteristic feature of Tricuspid Atresia.\\n\\nC. Pulmonary vascularity is diminished: Tricuspid Atresia is associated with decreased pulmonary blood flow, which can lead to diminished pulmonary vascularity. Therefore, option C is a characteristic feature of Tricuspid Atresia.\\n\\nD. Splitting of S2: Splitting of S2 is a normal physiological finding caused by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. It is not specifically associated with Tricuspid Atresia. Therefore, option D is not a characteristic feature of Tricuspid Atresia.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the answer is D. Splitting of S2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
