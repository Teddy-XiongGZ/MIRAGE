    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heme synthesis involves the condensation of succinyl CoA and glycine to produce 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) as the first step. The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, produces succinyl-CoA as an intermediate. Therefore, the intermediate of the Krebs cycle used in heme synthesis is succinyl-CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
