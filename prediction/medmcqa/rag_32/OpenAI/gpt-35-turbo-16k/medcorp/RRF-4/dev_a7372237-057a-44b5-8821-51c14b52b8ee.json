    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the position that can decrease excessive bleeding during oral surgery, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [11] discusses the impact of reverse Trendelenburg position and head-up position on intraoperative bleeding during rhinoplasty. It states that reverse Trendelenburg position reduces intraoperative bleeding in rhinoplasty patients while facilitating the procedure compared to the supine position. However, this information is specific to rhinoplasty and may not directly apply to oral surgery. Document [14] also mentions the effect of patient positioning on intraoperative bleeding in rhinoplasty. It states that surgery at a 15\u00b0 angle reverse Trendelenburg position provides the optimum working conditions by both significantly reducing intraoperative bleeding and allowing for comfortable conditions for the surgeon. Again, this information is specific to rhinoplasty and may not directly apply to oral surgery. Therefore, based on the provided documents, there is no clear evidence to determine the position that can decrease excessive bleeding during oral surgery. Further research or specific studies on oral surgery are needed to provide a definitive answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unknown\"}"
