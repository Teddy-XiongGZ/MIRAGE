    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has bilateral conductive deafness, which suggests a problem with sound conduction in both ears. The presence of tinnitus and a positive family history further supports the diagnosis of otospongiosis, which is a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear that can lead to conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. Tympanosclerosis and otitis media can also cause conductive hearing loss, but they are not typically associated with tinnitus or a positive family history. Meniere's disease is characterized by episodes of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ear, but it is not typically associated with conductive deafness. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is otospongiosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
