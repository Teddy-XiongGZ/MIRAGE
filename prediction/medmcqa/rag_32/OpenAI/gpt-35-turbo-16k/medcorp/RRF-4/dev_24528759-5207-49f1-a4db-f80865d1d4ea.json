    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the correct order of vascular events in inflammation is as follows: \\n1. Immediate transient - mast cell activation leads to the release of histamine and bradykinin, causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.\\n2. Immediate prolonged - direct endothelial injury by bacterial toxins.\\n3. Delayed prolonged - leukocyte-mediated injury.\\n4. Somewhat delayed prolonged - sun exposure/heat stroke leads to mild endothelial injury.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. ACDB.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. ACDB\"}"
