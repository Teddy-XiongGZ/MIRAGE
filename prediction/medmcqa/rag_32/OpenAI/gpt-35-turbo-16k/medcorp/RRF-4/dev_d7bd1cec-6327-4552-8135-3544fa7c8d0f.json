    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the population with the highest incidence of the shown root morphology, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [26] provides information on the morphology, extent, and distribution of root fusions in molars in a Chinese population. Document [3] discusses the root and canal morphology of mandibular first molars in a Korean population. Document [10] analyzes the root canal morphology of mandibular molars in a Saudi population. Document [13] examines the root and root canal anatomy of mandibular second molars in a Saudi subpopulation. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that the population with the highest incidence of the shown root morphology is likely to be Mongoloids, as mentioned in Document [3] and Document [13].\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Mongoloids\"}"
