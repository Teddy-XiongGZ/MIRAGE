    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High pressure oxygen through cannula has several advantages, so we need to identify the option that is not an obvious advantage. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Bypassing nasopharyngeal dead space: This is a known advantage of high pressure oxygen through cannula. It helps to reduce dead space and improve ventilation.\\n\\nB. Decreases need for intubation: This is also a known advantage of high pressure oxygen through cannula. It can provide effective oxygenation and respiratory support, reducing the need for intubation.\\n\\nC. PEEP: Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a technique used in mechanical ventilation to improve oxygenation. It is not a specific advantage of high pressure oxygen through cannula.\\n\\nD. Hot and Humidification of air: This is another known advantage of high pressure oxygen through cannula. It provides heated and humidified air, which improves patient comfort and reduces the risk of drying and irritation of the respiratory mucosa.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the option that is not an obvious advantage of high pressure oxygen through cannula is C. PEEP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
