    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the likely explanation for the lower proportion of false positive results in population A compared to population B, we need to consider the given information. The question states that the screening test is used in the same way in both populations. This suggests that the test characteristics, such as sensitivity and specificity, are the same in both populations. Therefore, we can rule out options A and D. The remaining options are B and C, which relate to the prevalence of the disease. If the prevalence of the disease is lower in population A, it would result in a lower proportion of false positive results. Therefore, the likely explanation is that the prevalence of the disease is lower in population A. Hence, the answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
