    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tooth in the mandibular arch is most likely to be displaced due to arch size discrepancy, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [27] states that tooth size discrepancy (TSD) is prevalent in orthodontic patients, with 24% of patients having anterior tooth width ratios and 8% having total arch ratios greater than \u00b12 standard deviations from Bolton's means. Document [18] also mentions that tooth size is an important factor in the assessment of crowding or spacing. Considering these findings, it is likely that the tooth most likely to be displaced due to arch size discrepancy in the mandibular arch is the tooth with the greatest tooth size discrepancy. Therefore, the answer is D. Second premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
