    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the most common morphological variation. To find the answer, we need to look for information about morphological variation in the relevant documents. Document [9] mentions that plants exhibit natural variation in their form and structure, and this variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant. However, the other documents do not provide specific information about the morphological variation of teeth. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine the most common morphological variation among the given choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot determine\"}"
