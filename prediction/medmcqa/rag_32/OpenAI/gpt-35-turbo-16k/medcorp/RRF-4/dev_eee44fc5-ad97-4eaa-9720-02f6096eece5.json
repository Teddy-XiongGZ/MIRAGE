    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the appropriate timing for the extraction of impacted 3rd molars in a patient planned for bilateral sagittal split osteotomy, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [1] states that at the Chang Gung Craniofacial Center, they always remove mandibular third molars during sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) to reduce psychological stress on patients and facilitate better exposure of impacted third molars. Document [6] also supports the removal of third molars at the time of orthognathic surgery, stating that it has social and financial benefits without increasing the risk of morbidity. However, Document [10] suggests that the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars should be done at least six months before the BSSO to prevent bad split incidence during the operation. Considering these documents, the most appropriate answer is B. At the time of surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
