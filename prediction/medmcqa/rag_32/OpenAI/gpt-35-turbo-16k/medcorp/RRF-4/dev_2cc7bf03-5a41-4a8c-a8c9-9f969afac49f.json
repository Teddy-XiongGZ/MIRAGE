    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To assess the strength of association between smoking and lung cancer, the best study design would be a cohort study. A cohort study involves following a group of individuals over time to determine the development of certain diseases or outcomes. In this case, individuals who are smokers (exposed group) and non-smokers (unexposed group) would be followed to determine the incidence of lung cancer. This study design allows for the assessment of temporality and the establishment of a dose-response relationship, which are important in determining causation. Cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, and randomized controlled trials are not ideal for assessing the strength of association between smoking and lung cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
