    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the type of immediately occurring reaction in which antigens combine with antibodies already attached to the surface of mast cells and basophils is called Type I hypersensitivity. This type of hypersensitivity reaction involves the binding of IgE antibodies to Fc\u03b5RI receptors on mast cells and basophils, leading to their sensitization. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, cross-linking of the bound IgE antibodies triggers the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, resulting in the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
