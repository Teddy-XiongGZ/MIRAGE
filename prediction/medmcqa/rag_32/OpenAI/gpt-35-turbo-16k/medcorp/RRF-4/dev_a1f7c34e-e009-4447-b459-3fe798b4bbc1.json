    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Right trochlear nerve palsy affects the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for intorsion, depression, and abduction of the eye. Therefore, the correct answer should be the symptom that is not associated with the function of the superior oblique muscle. Let's go through the options:\\n\\nA. Diplopia on upward gaze and adduction: This is a characteristic symptom of trochlear nerve palsy, as the affected eye cannot depress and intort properly, leading to vertical diplopia on upward gaze and adduction.\\n\\nB. Right head tilt: This is a compensatory mechanism seen in trochlear nerve palsy. Tilting the head to the opposite side of the affected eye helps to align the visual fields and reduce diplopia.\\n\\nC. Exotropia: Exotropia refers to an outward deviation of the eye. Trochlear nerve palsy can cause exotropia due to the unopposed action of the lateral rectus muscle.\\n\\nD. Hyperopia: Hyperopia is a refractive error and is not directly related to trochlear nerve palsy.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Hyperopia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
