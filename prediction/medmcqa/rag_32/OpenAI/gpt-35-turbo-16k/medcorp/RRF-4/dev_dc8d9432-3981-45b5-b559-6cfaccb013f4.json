    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following does not occur in High Copper Amalgam, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [4] states that high-copper amalgam releases more mercury than low-copper amalgam in an acidic media, indicating that electrochemical corrosion occurs in high-copper amalgam. Document [25] mentions that high-copper amalgams show a high dissolution rate in formic and lactic acid solutions, suggesting chemical corrosion. However, there is no specific mention of penetrating corrosion in any of the documents. Therefore, the answer is C. Penetrating Corrosion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
