    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the eruption process of the second molars and the changes in arch space. Document [1] states that the space available for emergence of the second molar is prepared before stage 2 of development, and then the tooth begins to erupt. Document [2] mentions that during the correction of upper arch crowding, space can be provided by the distal movement of the first molars before the eruption of the second molars. Document [13] also states that the eruption of the mandibular first permanent molar is associated with growth changes of adjacent structures. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the arch space for eruption of the 2nd and 3rd molars is created by the distal movement of the first molars before the eruption of the second molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
