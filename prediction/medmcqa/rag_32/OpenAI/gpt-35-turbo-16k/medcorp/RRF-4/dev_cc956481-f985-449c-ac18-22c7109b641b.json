    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To measure variation between two different units, we need a measure that allows us to compare the variability of the units. The variance (choice A) and standard deviation (choice B) are measures of dispersion that quantify the spread of data points around the mean. However, they do not specifically address the comparison between different units. The coefficient of variation (choice C) is a dimensionless measure that compares the standard deviation to the mean, making it suitable for comparing variation between different units. The range (choice D) is the difference between the maximum and minimum values and does not provide a comprehensive measure of variation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Coefficient of variation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
