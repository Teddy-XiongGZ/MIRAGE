    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The phallic stage of Freud's psychosexual development theory occurs between the ages of three and six, during which the child's libido centers upon their genitalia. Piaget's stages of cognitive development, on the other hand, do not directly correspond to Freud's psychosexual stages. Piaget's stages include the sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years), preoperational stage (2 to 7 years), concrete operational stage (7 to 11 years), and formal operational stage (11 years and older). Therefore, the phallic stage of Freud does not correspond to any specific stage of Piaget's theory.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
