To determine which malignancy can occur in such patients, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that carriers of one of the 11 recurrent CGA>TGA nonsense RB1 mutations have a significantly increased risk of second primary malignancy. Document [3] mentions that statistically significant excess mortality was found for second primary cancers of bone, connective tissue, and malignant melanoma and benign and malignant neoplasms of brain and meninges.
