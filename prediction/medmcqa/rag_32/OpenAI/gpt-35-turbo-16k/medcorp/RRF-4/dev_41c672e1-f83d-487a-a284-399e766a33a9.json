    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the type of bone present in the inter-radicular area, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [10] provides information on the histological and histochemical quantification of root resorption incident to the application of intrusive force to rat molars. Document [13] discusses direct and tomographic dimensional analysis of the inter-radicular distance and thickness of the vestibular cortical bone in the parasymphyseal region of adult human mandibles. Document [15] evaluates the anatomical evaluation of the dental arches using cone beam computed tomography and investigates the availability of bone for placement of mini-screws. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that the type of bone present in the inter-radicular area is cancellous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
