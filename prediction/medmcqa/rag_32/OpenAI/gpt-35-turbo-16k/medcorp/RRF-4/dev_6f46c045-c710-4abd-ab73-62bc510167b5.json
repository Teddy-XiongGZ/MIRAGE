    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient describes a well-demarcated area of depapillation on his tongue that has been present for as long as he can remember. This description is consistent with the condition known as geographic tongue. Geographic tongue is characterized by areas of atrophy and depapillation, leaving an erythematous and smoother surface than the unaffected areas. The depapillated areas are usually well-demarcated and bordered by a slightly raised, white, yellow, or grey peripheral zone. The condition may affect only part of the tongue or the entire dorsal surface at any one time. It goes through periods of remission and relapse. Median rhomboid glossitis is also a well-demarcated area of depapillation, but it typically presents in the midline of the dorsal surface of the tongue, just in front of the circumvallate papillae. Black hairy tongue is characterized by a black hairy structure on the dorsum of the tongue, which is not consistent with the patient's description. Moeller's glossitis is not a recognized medical condition. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis for this patient is B. Geographic tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
