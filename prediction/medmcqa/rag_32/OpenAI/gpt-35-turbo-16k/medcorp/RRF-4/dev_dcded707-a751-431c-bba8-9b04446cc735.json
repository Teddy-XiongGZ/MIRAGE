    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Detachment of myosin head from actin is caused by the release of ADP and Pi. According to Document [1], the myosin head first attaches to actin together with the products of ATP hydrolysis, performs a power stroke associated with the release of hydrolysis products (ADP and Pi), and detaches from actin upon binding with new ATP. This is further supported by Document [13], which states that at the end of the power stroke, ADP is released from the myosin head, leaving myosin attached to actin in a rigor state until another ATP binds to myosin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
