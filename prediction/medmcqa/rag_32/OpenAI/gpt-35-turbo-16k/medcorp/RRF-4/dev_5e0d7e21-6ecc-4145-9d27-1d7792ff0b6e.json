    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the contraindications for partial veneer crowns, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] mentions that veneer placement should be limited to individuals with significant aesthetic problems, such as badly cracked or broken teeth, that do not meet the requirements for a crown or full replacement. It also lists contraindications such as poor oral hygiene, uncontrolled gingival disease, high cavities rate, parafunction, no enamel, unreasonable patient expectations, and large existing restorations. None of the documents specifically mention the contraindication of partial veneer crowns in relation to long teeth, short teeth, tipped teeth, or tapered teeth. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively determine which option is contraindicated for partial veneer crowns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
