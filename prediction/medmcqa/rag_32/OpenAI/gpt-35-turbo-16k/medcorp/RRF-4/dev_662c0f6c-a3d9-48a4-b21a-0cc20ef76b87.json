    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Buffering capacity is a measure of the resistance to change in pH of a solution. It depends on the concentration of the buffering agent and its dissociation constant (Ka). From the given documents, we can see that the buffering capacity of a weak acid HA with dissociation constant Ka can be expressed as: Buffer capacity = Ka * [HA] / ([HA] + [A-]). To determine which of the given options has the maximum buffering capacity, we need to consider the dissociation constants (Ka) and the concentrations of the buffering agents. However, none of the given documents provide specific information about the dissociation constants or concentrations of the buffering agents histidine, cysteine, tyrosine, or arginine. Therefore, we cannot determine which option has the maximum buffering capacity based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
