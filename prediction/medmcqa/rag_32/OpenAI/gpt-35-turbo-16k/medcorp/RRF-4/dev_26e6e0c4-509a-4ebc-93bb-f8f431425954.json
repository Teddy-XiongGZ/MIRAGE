    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin resistance is seen in liver disease because of multiple factors. Document [1] explains that insulin resistance in liver diseases can be due to circulating insulin antagonists or a target tissue defect in insulin action. Document [2] mentions that insulin resistance in liver diseases can be due to changes in the state of the insulin receptor or due to a postreceptor defect. Document [5] states that once non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), it promotes further insulin resistance in the liver. Document [8] confirms that insulin resistance is the pathophysiological hallmark of NAFLD, which is considered the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome. Document [11] also highlights that insulin resistance is the pathophysiological hallmark of NAFLD. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Hepatic steatosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
