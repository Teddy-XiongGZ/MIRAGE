    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Porosity in acrylic dentures can be caused by various factors. A prolonged curing cycle (option A) can lead to porosity formation due to excessive heat or inadequate polymerization. Lack of sufficient pressure applied to the flask (option B) can result in incomplete adaptation of the acrylic resin, leading to porosity. Insufficient acrylic resin monomer (option C) can cause incomplete polymerization and result in porosity. Prolonged bench cooling after curing (option D) is not a known cause of porosity in acrylic dentures. Therefore, the correct answer is either A, B, or C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/C\"}"
