    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, causing a change in the enzyme's conformation and reducing its activity. In this case, acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase, which is responsible for the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate ions and protons. By inhibiting this enzyme, acetazolamide reduces the production of bicarbonate ions and protons, leading to a decrease in intraocular pressure. Since non-competitive inhibitors do not compete with the substrate for binding to the active site, they do not affect the Vmax (maximum rate of reaction). Therefore, the correct answer is D. No change in Vmax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
