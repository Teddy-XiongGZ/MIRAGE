    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine in which of the following microvilli are not present, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Microvilli are microscopic cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area for diffusion and are involved in a wide variety of functions, including absorption, secretion, cellular adhesion, and mechanotransduction. The documents mention the presence of microvilli in various locations, such as the small intestines, eggs, white blood cells, and the apical aspect of many epithelial cells. However, there is no specific mention of microvilli in the gallbladder, duodenum, collecting duct, or proximal convoluted tubule. Therefore, we can conclude that microvilli are not present in any of these locations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/C/D\"}"
