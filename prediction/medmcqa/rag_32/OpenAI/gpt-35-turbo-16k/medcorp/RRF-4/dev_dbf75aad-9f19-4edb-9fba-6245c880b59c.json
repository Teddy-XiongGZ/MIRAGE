    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following show chemical bond with enamel, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] mentions that MDP (10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogenphosphate) has chemical bonding ability to tooth hard tissues, including enamel. Document [14] also discusses the chemical bonding of enamel with certain cations from an acid etching solution. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Composites, as they contain MDP and can form a chemical bond with enamel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
