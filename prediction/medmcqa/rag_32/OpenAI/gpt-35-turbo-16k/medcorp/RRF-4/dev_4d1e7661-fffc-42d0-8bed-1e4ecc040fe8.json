    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given information, the Rinne test is negative and the Weber test is centralized. A negative Rinne test indicates that bone conduction is better than air conduction, suggesting a conductive hearing loss. The centralized Weber test indicates that there is no lateralization of sound, which is consistent with a conductive hearing loss. Among the given options, the most likely diagnosis for a conductive hearing loss with these findings is C. Stapedial Otosclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
