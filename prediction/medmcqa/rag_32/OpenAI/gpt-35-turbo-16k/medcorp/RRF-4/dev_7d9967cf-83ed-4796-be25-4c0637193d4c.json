    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The absolute refractory period of a neuron occurs after an action potential and generally lasts one millisecond. During this period, a new action potential cannot be elicited. The closure of inactivated Na channels is responsible for the absolute refractory period. When the Na channels are inactivated, they cannot be reopened until the membrane is repolarized. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Closure of inactivated Na channels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
