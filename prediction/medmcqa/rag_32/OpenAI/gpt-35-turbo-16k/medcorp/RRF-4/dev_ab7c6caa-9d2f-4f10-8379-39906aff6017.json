    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, transvaginal sonography is commonly used to assess endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women with bleeding. The cutoff value for endometrial thickness that is often used to determine the need for further investigation or biopsy varies in the literature. Document [12] suggests that an endometrial thickness of \u22644 mm has a negative predictive value of >99% for endometrial cancer. Document [22] also mentions that an endometrial thickness of \u22644 mm is associated with endometrial atrophy, which is the most common cause of postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Therefore, the answer choice would be C. 4mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
