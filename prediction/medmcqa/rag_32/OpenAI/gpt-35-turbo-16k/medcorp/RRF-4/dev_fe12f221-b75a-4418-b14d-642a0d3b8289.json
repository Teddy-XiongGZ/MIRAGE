    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which condition is associated with an increased collum angle, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. The collum angle refers to the crown-root angulation of the teeth. Document [0] discusses the collum angle of maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth in different skeletal malocclusions. It states that a statistically significant increase in the collum angle was observed in the maxillary central incisors of Class II division 2 malocclusion. Document [4] also supports this finding, stating that the collum angle of maxillary central incisors was significantly greater in Class II division 2 malocclusion compared to other classes. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Class II div 2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
