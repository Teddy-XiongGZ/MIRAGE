    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the least amount of mercury required, we need to analyze the relevant documents for information on different forms of mercury and their usage. We can start by searching for information on mercury alloys and their composition. We can also look for information on the different forms of mercury mentioned in the answer choices (admixed alloy, spherical, hybrid, and lathe cut alloy) to see if any of them require a smaller amount of mercury. By analyzing the information in the documents, we can identify the answer choice that corresponds to the least amount of mercury required.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
