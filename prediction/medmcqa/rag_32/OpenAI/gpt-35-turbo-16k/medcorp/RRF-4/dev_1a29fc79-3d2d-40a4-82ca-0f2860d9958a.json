    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a patient with Hepatitis B infection, the marker that will be increased is HbsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen). HbsAg is a protein on the surface of the hepatitis B virus and is the first marker to appear in the blood during acute infection. It indicates active viral replication and ongoing infection. HbcAg (Hepatitis B core antigen) is an antigen that is not typically detected in the blood during acute infection. Anti HbsAg IgG (antibody to Hepatitis B surface antigen) and Anti HbcAg IgG (antibody to Hepatitis B core antigen) are antibodies that are produced by the immune system in response to the infection, but their levels may vary depending on the stage of the infection and the immune response of the individual.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
