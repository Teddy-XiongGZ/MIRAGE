    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi tendon organ (GTO) is a sensory receptor that senses changes in muscle tension. It is not characterized by a high threshold, as it has a very low threshold and can be activated by a single fiber twitch. It does not detect length change, as it is sensitive to changes in muscle tension. It is also not limited to dynamic response only. The GTO is connected with a fascicle of 5-25 muscle fibers, contributed by several motor units. Therefore, the true statement about the Golgi tendon organ is D. 3-25 muscle fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
