    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the true statement about YTHT cells, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [2] provides information about YT cells, which are a natural-killer-like (NK-like) lymphoid cell line. It mentions that the YT cells expressed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated nuclear antigen and had a monoclonal derivation in terms of the terminal repeat junctional structure of EBV DNA. It also states that the YT-0 cells exhibited NK and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, but the YT2C2 and YTC3 cells did not. Based on this information, we can conclude that the true statement about YTHT cells is that they exhibit NK and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
