    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine the function of Golgi bodies. The Golgi apparatus is involved in the processing, modification, and sorting of proteins. It receives proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in vesicles, and these proteins are then modified and packaged into new vesicles for transport to their final destination. The Golgi apparatus is also responsible for the addition of sugar molecules to proteins, a process known as glycosylation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Sorting of glycoproteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
