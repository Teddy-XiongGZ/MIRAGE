    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Odd-chain fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation in the same manner as even-chain fatty acids. However, once a five-carbon chain remains, the final spiral of beta-oxidation will yield one molecule of acetyl CoA and one molecule of propionyl CoA. This three-carbon molecule, propionyl CoA, can be enzymatically converted to succinyl CoA, forming a bridge between the TCA cycle and fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Propionyl CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
