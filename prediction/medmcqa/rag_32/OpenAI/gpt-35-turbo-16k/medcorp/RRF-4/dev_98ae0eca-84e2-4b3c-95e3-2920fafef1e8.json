    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents that discuss the occurrence of multiple canals in mandibular premolars. We can start by looking at Document [1], which investigates the radiographic incidence of multiple roots and canals in human mandibular premolars. According to this study, the incidence of multiple canals in mandibular premolars was found in 15.7% of patients for first premolars and 7% for second premolars. This suggests that multiple canals in mandibular premolars can be seen in both first and second premolars. We can also refer to Document [4], which reports the prevalence and morphology of multiple roots, root canals, and C-shaped canals in mandibular premolars in a Thai population. This study found that multiple root canals were present in 19.48% of first premolars and 3.85% of second premolars. Therefore, the occurrence of multiple canals in mandibular premolars is not limited to a specific race or ethnicity. Based on this information, we can conclude that multiple canals in mandibular premolars can be seen in both first and second premolars, regardless of race or ethnicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
