    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate pontic design, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the flat (F) and step (S) pontic designs are recommended for ridges with optimal soft tissue volume after periodontal reconstruction. Document [4] mentions that in the posterior segment, a sanitary pontic form is most compatible with function and hygiene. Document [7] discusses the ovate pontic design as a potential option for achieving aesthetic outcomes. Based on this information, the most appropriate pontic design would be the one that contacts the mucosa without irritating it, which is mentioned in Document [2]. Therefore, the answer is C. Should contact mucosa but should not irritate it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
