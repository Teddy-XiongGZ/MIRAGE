    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine why deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that dental fluorosis, specifically enamel mottling and hypoplasia, is not seen in deciduous bovine teeth. Document [3] explains that dental fluorosis occurs during tooth formation when there is a higher than normal amount of fluoride ingestion. Document [7] mentions that prenatal fluoride passes from the mother to fetal teeth, but the low concentration of fluoride in the inner enamel is incorporated mainly during the secretory stage, while the enhanced concentration in the surface enamel is produced during the much longer maturation stage. Document [11] describes fluorosis as causing subsurface porosity or hypomineralizations in dental enamel. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is C. The calcification time of deciduous teeth is less, which means that the enamel formation is completed before the enhanced concentration of fluoride is incorporated into the surface enamel during the maturation stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
