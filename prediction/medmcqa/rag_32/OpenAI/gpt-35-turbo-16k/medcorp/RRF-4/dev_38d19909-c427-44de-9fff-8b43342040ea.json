    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the net filtration pressure, we need to use the equation PUF = PGC - PBS - \u03c0GC. Given that no proteins were filtered, we can assume that \u03c0GC = 0. Therefore, the net filtration pressure is PUF = PGC - PBS. Substituting the given values, PGC = 42 mm Hg and PBS = 16 mm Hg, we get PUF = 42 mm Hg - 16 mm Hg = 26 mm Hg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 28 mm Hg\"}"
