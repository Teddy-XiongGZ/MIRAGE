    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The oxygen carrying capacity of blood is determined by the hemoglobin concentration. Each gram of hemoglobin can carry approximately 1.34 mL of oxygen. Therefore, to calculate the oxygen carrying capacity, we can multiply the hemoglobin concentration (14 g/dL) by 1.34 mL/g. This gives us an oxygen carrying capacity of 18.76 mL/dL. Since the question asks for the oxygen carrying capacity in an 18-year-old patient with a hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, the answer is 18.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
