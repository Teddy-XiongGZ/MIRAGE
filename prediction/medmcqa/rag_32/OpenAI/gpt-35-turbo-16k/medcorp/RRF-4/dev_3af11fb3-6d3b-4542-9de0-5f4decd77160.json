    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can determine what does not occur in the 5'-3' direction by examining the relevant information. Document [7] discusses the 3'-to-5' polymerization of non-complementary RNA by an 'invertase'. This suggests that RNA can be synthesized in the 3'-to-5' direction. Document [27] mentions the stereochemistry of the 2'-5' and 3'-5' dinucleoside monophosphates of polynucleotides, indicating that the 3'-5' bonds allow the formation of helical configurations for RNA. However, there is no specific information provided about DNA repair, DNA replication, or transcription in the 5'-3' direction. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is not mentioned in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/C/D\"}"
