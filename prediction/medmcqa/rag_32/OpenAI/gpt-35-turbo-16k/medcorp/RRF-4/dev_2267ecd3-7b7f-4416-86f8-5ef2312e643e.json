    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described (high grade fever, inspiratory stridor, swallowing difficulty, and drooling of saliva), the most likely diagnosis is acute epiglottitis. Acute epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the supraglottic tissues, most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. The main concern in acute epiglottitis is maintaining the airway, as there is a risk of rapid progression to complete airway obstruction. Therefore, the immediate management should focus on securing the airway, which often requires endotracheal intubation. Antibiotic therapy is also essential to treat the underlying infection. The recommended antibiotic for acute epiglottitis is IV ceftriaxone, as it provides coverage against Haemophilus influenzae. Nebulized racemic epinephrine and corticosteroids are not the primary treatments for acute epiglottitis and should not be used as the initial management. Anti-diphtheria toxin is not indicated in this case, as acute epiglottitis is not caused by diphtheria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
