    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the configuration of the proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar can be determined. Let's analyze the information from the documents. Document [0] provides information about cavity formations in second deciduous molars, while Document [1] discusses cavity formations in first deciduous molars. However, neither of these documents specifically mention the configuration of the proximal walls of class II cavities on deciduous molars. Document [2] provides information about cavity classifications according to G.V. Black and Graham J. Mount, but again, it does not specifically address the configuration of the proximal walls of class II cavities on deciduous molars. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the configuration of the proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unknown\"}"
