    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is false about Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. TRALI is characterized by the sudden development of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema after transfusion of blood products. It is a serious complication of blood transfusion and is the leading cause of transfusion-associated mortality. TRALI can occur within 6 hours after a transfusion, so statement A is false. TRALI can be associated with various clinical conditions, including sepsis and cardiac surgeries, so statement B is true. TRALI is indeed a cause of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, so statement C is true. Finally, TRALI can be caused by both plasma and whole blood transfusions, so statement D is true. Therefore, the false statement about TRALI is A. It does not necessarily develop within 24 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
