    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The easiest 3rd molar surgical extraction can be determined by considering the anatomical position and the degree of impaction. Based on the provided documents, the easiest extraction would be the vertical position. This is because a vertically positioned third molar is more aligned with the occlusal plane and has a more favorable angulation for extraction. On the other hand, mesioangular, horizontal, and distoangular positions are more likely to be impacted and require more complex surgical techniques for extraction. Therefore, the answer is C. Vertical.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
