    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CG islands in our DNA are important for methylation. According to the documents, CpG islands are typically unmethylated and are often promoters for housekeeping genes. Methylation of CpG islands plays a role in transcriptional silencing in higher organisms. Additionally, the presence of CG islands is associated with the binding of DNA-binding proteins that protect the DNA from methylation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Methylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
