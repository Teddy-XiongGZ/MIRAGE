    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the rabies vaccine should not be given in a specific case, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the rabies vaccine is used to prevent rabies before and after exposure to the rabies virus, which is commonly caused by a dog bite or a bat bite. Document [5] mentions that domestic dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits are required to be vaccinated against rabies. Document [6] states that therapy for rabies is futile once the disease has developed, emphasizing the importance of prophylaxis. Based on this information, we can conclude that the rabies vaccine should not be given in case of a rat bite, as it is not mentioned in the provided documents as a common cause of rabies exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
