    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If the interocclusal distance is increased beyond physiologic limits, it can lead to various issues. A muscular imbalance is a possible consequence of an increased interocclusal distance. This can occur when the muscles that control jaw movement are not properly balanced due to the change in interocclusal distance. An occlusal disharmony in centric can also result from an increased interocclusal distance, as the normal alignment of the upper and lower teeth in centric occlusion may be disrupted. However, a displacement of the mandibular or maxillary denture is not directly related to an increased interocclusal distance. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. A muscular imbalance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
