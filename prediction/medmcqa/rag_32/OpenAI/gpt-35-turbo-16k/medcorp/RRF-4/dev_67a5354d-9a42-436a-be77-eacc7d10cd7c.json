    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how an enamel hatchet is differentiated from a chisel, we need to compare the characteristics of both tools. The relevant documents that provide information about enamel hatchets and chisels are Document [4] (Evaluation of hand instruments used in operative dentistry: hardness and sharpness) and Document [5] (Dental instrument). From these documents, we can gather the following information: \\n\\n- Enamel hatchets are used in operative dentistry to plane enamel and have a blade that is specifically designed for this purpose (Document [4]).\\n- Chisels, on the other hand, are used for various purposes in dentistry, including widening the entrance of the tooth cavity and slicing away thin carious enamel (Document [5]).\\n\\nBased on this information, we can compare the characteristics of enamel hatchets and chisels to determine how they are differentiated. \\n\\nA. Curved in one plane only: Both enamel hatchets and chisels can have curved blades, so this is not a characteristic that differentiates them.\\nB. Blade is larger: Enamel hatchets have a blade that is specifically designed for planing enamel, so it is possible that the blade of an enamel hatchet is larger than that of a chisel. However, the documents do not provide specific information about the size of the blades, so we cannot definitively say that this is a characteristic that differentiates them.\\nC. Blade is perpendicular to the long axis of handle: Both enamel hatchets and chisels can have blades that are perpendicular to the long axis of the handle, so this is not a characteristic that differentiates them.\\nD. Blade is heavier: The documents do not provide specific information about the weight of the blades of enamel hatchets and chisels, so we cannot definitively say that this is a characteristic that differentiates them.\\n\\nBased on the information available, it appears that none of the given options definitively differentiate an enamel hatchet from a chisel. Therefore, the correct answer is: None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
