    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the answer, we need to search for information about replacing eugenol in zinc oxide eugenol cement. Document [3] mentions that non-eugenol materials use long chain aliphatic acids or aryl-substituted butyric acid to react with zinc oxide particles. This suggests that eugenol can be replaced by long chain aliphatic acids or aryl-substituted butyric acid. None of the given options match this description. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
