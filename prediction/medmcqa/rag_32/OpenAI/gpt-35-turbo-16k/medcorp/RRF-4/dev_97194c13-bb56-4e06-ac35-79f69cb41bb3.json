    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the storage temperatures of RBC, Platelet, and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP). According to Document [1], platelets are stored at room temperature (20-22\u00b0C) with agitation. Document [3] states that whole blood can be stored at 22\u00b0C for up to 24 hours. Document [4] mentions that fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is stored at -30\u00b0C. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: RBC 20-22\u00b0C, Platelet 2-6\u00b0C, FFP -30\u00b0C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
