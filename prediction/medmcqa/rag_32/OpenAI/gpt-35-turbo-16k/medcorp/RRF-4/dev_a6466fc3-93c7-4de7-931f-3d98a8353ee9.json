    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To detect the translocation t(11;22) in Ewing's sarcoma, the best method would be fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH is a molecular cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent probes to detect specific DNA sequences. It is commonly used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, including translocations. In the case of Ewing's sarcoma, the translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) is characteristic, and FISH can specifically detect this translocation by labeling the EWS gene on chromosome 22 and the FLI-1 gene on chromosome 11. Therefore, the correct answer is C. FISH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
