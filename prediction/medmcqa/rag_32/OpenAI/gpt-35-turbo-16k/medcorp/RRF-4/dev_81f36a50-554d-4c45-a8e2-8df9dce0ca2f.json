    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Substrate-level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle results in the production of a high-energy phosphate compound. According to the documents, succinate thiokinase catalyzes the cleavage of succinyl CoA's thioester bond, which is coupled with the phosphorylation of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and produces GTP. Therefore, the high-energy phosphate compound formed in the citric acid cycle through substrate-level phosphorylation is GTP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. GTP\"}"
