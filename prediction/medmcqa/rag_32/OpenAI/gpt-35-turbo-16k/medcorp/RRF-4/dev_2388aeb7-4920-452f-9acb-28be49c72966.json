    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autoinfection is the ability of a helminth to complete its life cycle within a single host, leading to ongoing infection without the need for external exposure to infective larvae. Based on the provided documents, autoinfection is mentioned in relation to Strongyloides stercoralis. To answer the question, we need to identify which helminths are capable of autoinfection. Going through the options: \\n\\nA. Enterobius vermicularis: Autoinfection is mentioned in Document [7], which states that autoinfection can occur in an immunocompetent host, although at a low level. Therefore, Enterobius vermicularis can cause autoinfection. \\n\\nB. Hymenolepis nana: Autoinfection is mentioned in Document [21], which states that in some parts of the world, individuals who are heavily infected with Hymenolepis nana can experience internal autoinfection. Therefore, Hymenolepis nana can cause autoinfection. \\n\\nC. Taenia solium: There is no mention of autoinfection in the provided documents for Taenia solium. \\n\\nD. Ascaris lumbricoides: Autoinfection is mentioned in Document [31], which states that Ascaris lumbricoides can be diagnosed by the presence of eggs, larvae, or adult worms. Therefore, Ascaris lumbricoides can cause autoinfection. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the helminth that cannot cause autoinfection is Taenia solium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
