    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, good contacts in primary teeth with lack of spacing predicts normal occlusion in permanent teeth. Document [1] mentions that good stable contacts often appear as small and not very prominent markings when articulating paper is used, indicating a normal occlusion. Document [7] also states that an ideal primary dentition is an indicator of future ideal permanent dentition. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
