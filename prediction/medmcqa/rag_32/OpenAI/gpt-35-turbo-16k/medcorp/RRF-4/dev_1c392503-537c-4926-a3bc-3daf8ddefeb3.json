    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the indication for open reduction of condylar fracture, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that open reduction was significantly more frequent in patients with subcondylar fracture compared to those with a fracture in the condylar head area. Document [5] also supports this, stating that open reduction for bilateral condylar head fractures presented better functional and radiographic outcomes. Document [8] mentions that open reduction is indicated when closed reduction cannot achieve satisfactory occlusion. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Lateral displacement of the condyle (or) Lateral fracture dislocation condyle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
