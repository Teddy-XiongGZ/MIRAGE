    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the child's mother behavior, we need to analyze the child's behavior and its possible causes. The child being evasive and dawdling could indicate a lack of motivation or resistance to certain tasks. This behavior may be influenced by the mother's parenting style and behavior. A. Overprotective mother: An overprotective mother tends to be overly involved in her child's life and may try to shield the child from challenges or discomfort. This parenting style is unlikely to cause the child to be evasive and dawdling. B. Authoritarian mother: An authoritarian mother is strict and demanding, setting high expectations and enforcing strict rules. This parenting style may lead to the child feeling pressured and may contribute to the child's evasive and dawdling behavior. C. Rejecting mother: A rejecting mother is emotionally distant and may neglect the child's needs. This parenting style may result in the child feeling unsupported and may contribute to the child's evasive and dawdling behavior. D. Underaffectionate mother: An underaffectionate mother may show a lack of warmth and emotional support towards the child. This parenting style may lead to the child feeling unloved and may contribute to the child's evasive and dawdling behavior. Based on the child's behavior, the most likely mother behavior is B. Authoritarian mother, as the child's evasive and dawdling behavior may be a response to the strict and demanding parenting style.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
