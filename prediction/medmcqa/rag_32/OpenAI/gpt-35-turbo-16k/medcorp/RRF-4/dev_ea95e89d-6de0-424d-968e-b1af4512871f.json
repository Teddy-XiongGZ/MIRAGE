    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR), we need to find the difference in risk between the control group and the intervention group. The risk in the control group is the number of subjects who developed HT complications divided by the total number of subjects in the control group. The risk in the intervention group is the number of subjects who developed HT complications divided by the total number of subjects in the intervention group. The ARR is the difference between these two risks. To calculate the relative risk (RR), we need to divide the risk in the intervention group by the risk in the control group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
