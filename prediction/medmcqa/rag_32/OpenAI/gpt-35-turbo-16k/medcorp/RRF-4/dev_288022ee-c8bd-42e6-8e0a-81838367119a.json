    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with point hemorrhages in the scalp, bleeding in joints, and erythematous lesions in the skin. X-ray of the knee joint is suggestive of hemarthrosis. These symptoms are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The problem lies with the carboxylation of coagulation factors. Carboxylation is a post-translational modification that is necessary for the activation of coagulation factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X. Without proper carboxylation, these factors cannot function properly, leading to a bleeding tendency. This is commonly seen in vitamin K deficiency, which is often caused by a poor diet lacking in vitamin K-rich foods. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Carboxylation of coagulation factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
