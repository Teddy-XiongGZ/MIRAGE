    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the next steps for a concentric teeth bite mark on the forearm, we can refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the use of 3D imaging techniques to provide context and analyze changes in appearance over time for bite marks. Document [2] mentions the use of modeling wax plates to compare bite mark impressions on the victim's skin with dental imprints. Document [4] discusses the limitations of 2D methods for analyzing bite marks and presents a 3D documentation and analysis approach. Document [6] emphasizes the uniqueness of bite mark patterns and the importance of dental characteristics in identifying the biter.
