    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best radiographic view of the temporomandibular joint, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that panoramic radiography is the technique of choice in general practice and provides adequate screening images of the temporomandibular joints. Document [5] mentions that panoramic tomograms represent the temporomandibular joint better than general panoramic radiographs. Document [9] states that plain radiography allows visualization of the joint's mineralized areas but excludes the cartilage and soft tissues. Document [14] suggests that multiple-layers lateral tomography should be widely used in clinical practice. Based on this information, the best radiographic view of the temporomandibular joint is likely the panoramic tomogram.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
