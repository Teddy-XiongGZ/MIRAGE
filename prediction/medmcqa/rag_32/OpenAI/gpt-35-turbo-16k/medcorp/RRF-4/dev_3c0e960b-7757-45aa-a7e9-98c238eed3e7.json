    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common site of zygomatic arch fracture, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that 90 (14%) of the 642 patients had zygomatic arch fractures, but it does not specify the location of these fractures. Document [3] mentions that trauma to the zygomatic arch can result in different injury patterns, including fracture with medial displacement, fracture with posterior telescoping, explosive burst with lateral displacement, and bending in the axial plane without fracture. However, it does not provide specific information about the most common site of fracture. Document [8] provides a classification of zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures, but it does not specifically mention the site of zygomatic arch fractures. Document [14] mentions that nondisplaced fractures of the zygomatic arch are often observable, while displaced fractures require reduction. However, it does not specify the location of the fractures. Based on the available information, we do not have a specific location mentioned for the most common site of zygomatic arch fracture. Therefore, the answer is D. No specific location.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
