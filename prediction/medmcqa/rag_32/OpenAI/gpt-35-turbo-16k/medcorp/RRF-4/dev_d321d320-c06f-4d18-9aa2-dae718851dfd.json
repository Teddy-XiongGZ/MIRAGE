    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that prolonged contact (several hours) of NiTi endodontic instruments with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) has a considerable corrosive effect which reduces the instruments' resistance to fractures. However, Document [12] mentions that immersion in 2.5% NaOCl for 5 minutes significantly reduced the resistance to cyclic fatigue for all the files. Based on this information, it can be inferred that prolonged immersion in NaOCl is not recommended. Therefore, the correct answer is not likely to be 2 hours (D). Since there is no specific mention of the exact duration in the provided documents, we cannot definitively determine the correct answer. However, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to assume that a shorter duration would be more appropriate to prevent damage to file corrosion. Therefore, the most reasonable answer choice would be 20 mins (A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
