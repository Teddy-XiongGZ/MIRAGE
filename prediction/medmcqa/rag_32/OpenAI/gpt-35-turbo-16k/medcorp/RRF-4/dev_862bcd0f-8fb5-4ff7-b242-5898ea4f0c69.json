    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the non-invasive method to measure blood flow, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [4] mentions the use of a non-invasive electromagnetic flowmeter to provide accurate and quantitative measurements of blood flow in vascular surgery. Document [5] discusses the use of the oscillometric method to non-invasively determine arterial blood flow. Document [8] mentions the non-contact laser speckle method for measuring steady-state and dynamic skin blood flow. Document [23] discusses laser-Doppler flowmetry as a non-invasive technique for measuring tissue blood flow. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Laser Doppler flowmetry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
