    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which options are resorbable Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR), we need to review the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions the use of bioresorbable devices in GTR therapy, while Document [2] discusses the use of bioresorbable and non-resorbable devices. Document [12] specifically mentions the use of a resorbable membrane in GTR. Based on this information, we can conclude that options A, B, and C are resorbable GTR materials. Therefore, the correct answer is D. PTFE, which is a non-resorbable material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
