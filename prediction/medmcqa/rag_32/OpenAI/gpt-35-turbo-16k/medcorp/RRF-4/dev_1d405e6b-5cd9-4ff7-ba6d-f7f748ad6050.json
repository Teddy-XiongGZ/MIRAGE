    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that represents the extent of a drug's distribution in the body. A low apparent volume of distribution indicates that the drug is not extensively distributed to tissues. This means that a smaller proportion of the drug is distributed outside of the plasma compartment, resulting in a lower Vd. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Drug is not extensively distributed to tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
