    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the release of reactive oxygen metabolites in lysosomes is primarily mediated by NADPH oxidase. Document [0] mentions that activation of lysosomal NADPH oxidase by phorbol ester results in the increase of intralysosomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O2- and H2O2. Document [4] also states that primed neutrophils release extracellular reactive oxygen metabolites during phagocytosis, which is mediated by NADPH oxidase. Therefore, the correct answer is B. NADPH oxidase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
