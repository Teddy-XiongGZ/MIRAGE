    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reverse bevel incision is a specific type of incision technique used in various surgical procedures. To determine its purpose, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] describes the reverse bevel incision technique in crown lengthening, stating that the initial incision is guided by pre-operative planning and is based on the amount of tooth structure to be exposed. The beveling incision also follows a scalloped outline to ensure maximal interproximal coverage of the alveolar bone. Document [14] mentions the reverse bevel incision in pocket epithelium removal during mucoperiosteal flap surgery. It states that the reverse bevel incision is made to eliminate pocket epithelium and allow apical repositioning of the flap. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the reverse bevel incision is made to provide access to the alveolar crest and remove infected tissue in the sulcus. However, there is no specific mention of using the reverse bevel incision for atraumatic reflection of the gingival margin. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Provide access to the alveolar crest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
