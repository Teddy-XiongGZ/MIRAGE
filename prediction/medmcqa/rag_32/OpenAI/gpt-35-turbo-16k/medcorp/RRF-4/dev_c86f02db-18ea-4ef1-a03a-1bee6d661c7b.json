    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is not an example of a syndrome caused by uniparental disomy, we need to review the information in the relevant documents. Document [3] states that uniparental disomy is responsible for a proportion of cases in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Document [16] mentions that UPD can disrupt parent-specific genomic imprinting, resulting in imprinting disorders such as Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Document [19] also mentions Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes as examples of UPD. However, there is no mention of Russell-Silver syndrome or Bloom syndrome in any of the documents. Therefore, the answer is C. Russell-Silver syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
