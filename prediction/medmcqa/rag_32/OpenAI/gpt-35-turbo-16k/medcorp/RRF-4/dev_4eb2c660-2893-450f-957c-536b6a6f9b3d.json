    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A feed-forward mechanism refers to a control system that responds to a pre-defined command signal without adjusting based on the load or external environment. It is based on knowledge about the process and does not rely on feedback. Looking at the potential choices, feeling thirsty while walking in hot temperature, shivering on exposure to cold temperature, and salivation on smelling food are all examples of physiological responses that are triggered by feedback mechanisms in response to external stimuli. On the other hand, increase in blood pressure during supine posture is an example of a feed-forward mechanism. When a person changes from a sitting or standing position to lying down, the body automatically increases blood pressure to compensate for the change in posture and maintain adequate blood flow to the brain. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increase blood pressure during supine posture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
