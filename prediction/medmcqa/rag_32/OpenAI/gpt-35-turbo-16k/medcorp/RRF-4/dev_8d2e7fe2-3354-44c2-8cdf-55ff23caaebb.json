    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tooth has the sharpest cusp, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [4] provides information about the maxillary first molars, stating that the mesiolingual cusp is the largest and sharpest cusp. However, none of the potential choices are maxillary first molars. Document [6] mentions the cusps of the premolars, but it does not specify which premolar has the sharpest cusp. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the tooth with the sharpest cusp based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot determine\"}"
