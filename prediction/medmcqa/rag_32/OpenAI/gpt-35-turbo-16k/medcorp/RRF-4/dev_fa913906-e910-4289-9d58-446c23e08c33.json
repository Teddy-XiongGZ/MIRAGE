Document [0] mentions that irradiation can result in an atherosclerotic-like disorder in large arteries supplying the brain. Document [2] states that radiation necrosis, which is the death of healthy tissue near the irradiated site, occurs because radiation damages blood vessels in the area, reducing blood supply. Document [13] describes the gradual reduction in the number of blood and lymphatic vessels following irradiation. Document [14] discusses the histopathological findings in arterial radiation injury, including vessel wall thickening, thrombosis, and luminal occlusion. Document [25] mentions that ionizing radiation can cause damage to blood vessels, leading to morphologic abnormalities and disturbances in microcirculation. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
