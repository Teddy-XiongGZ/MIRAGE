    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following statements is not true about glomerular capillaries, we need to analyze each statement. \\n\\nA. The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it: According to Document [2], the oncotic pressure on glomerular capillaries is one of the forces that resist filtration. This means that the oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is actually higher than that of the fluid entering it. Therefore, statement A is not true.\\n\\nB. Glucose concentration in the capillaries is the same as that in glomerular filtrate: There is no information in the provided documents that directly addresses the glucose concentration in the capillaries. Therefore, we cannot determine the accuracy of statement B.\\n\\nC. Constriction of afferent arteriole decreases the blood flow to the glomerulus: According to Document [3], the afferent arteriole is responsible for delivering blood to the glomerulus. Therefore, constriction of the afferent arteriole would indeed decrease the blood flow to the glomerulus. Statement C is true.\\n\\nD. Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of the fluid entering it: According to Document [2], the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered from the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time. This means that the fluid leaving the capillaries is the glomerular filtrate, which is a plasma-like fluid. Therefore, the hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries would be expected to be similar to that of the fluid entering it. Statement D is true.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is not true about glomerular capillaries is A. The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
