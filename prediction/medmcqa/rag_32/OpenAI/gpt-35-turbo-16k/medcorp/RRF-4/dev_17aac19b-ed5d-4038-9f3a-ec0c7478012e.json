    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor that exhibits a range of histopathologic features, such as follicular, plexiform, acanthomatous, granular, basal cell, and desmoplastic variants. To determine which histological entity ameloblastoma resembles, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [25] states that the histological features of ameloblastoma include two main patterns: follicular and plexiform. Document [18] mentions that ameloblastic carcinoma, a malignant variant of ameloblastoma, has certain features of benign ameloblastoma such as reverse polarization, peripheral palisading, and stellate reticulum-like cells. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that ameloblastoma histologically resembles follicular and plexiform patterns, which are characteristic of ameloblastoma itself. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the provided choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not listed among the choices\"}"
