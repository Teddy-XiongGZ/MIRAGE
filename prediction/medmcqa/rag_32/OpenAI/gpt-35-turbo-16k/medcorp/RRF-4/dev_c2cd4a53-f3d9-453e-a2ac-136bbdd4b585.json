    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the true statement about carbamazepine. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Not associated with agranulocytosis: Document [6] mentions that a side effect of concern with carbamazepine is hepatic toxicity, but few cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\\n\\nB. Has been known to cause Steven-Johnson's syndrome: Document [5] mentions that a rare side effect of carbamazepine is an auditory side effect and that rashes occur in about 5% of patients receiving carbamazepine. Steven-Johnson's syndrome is a severe skin reaction that can be caused by carbamazepine. Therefore, option B is correct.\\n\\nC. Causes serious nephrogenic toxicity: There is no mention of carbamazepine causing serious nephrogenic toxicity in the provided documents. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\\n\\nD. Drug monitoring is not required: Document [9] mentions that several studies have tried to establish a relationship between plasma carbamazepine and clinical effect, and that side effects are more frequent at higher plasma concentrations. This suggests that drug monitoring may be necessary to ensure therapeutic levels and avoid side effects. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B.
