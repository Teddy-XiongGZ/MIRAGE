    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the finish line used in complete metal cast crown, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [11] states that several types of finish line configurations have been advocated for crown preparations, including chamfer, shoulder, and feather edge. Document [6] mentions that the study evaluated axial and marginal fit of crowns made for three tooth preparations that had different labial finish-line configurations: shoulder, shoulder-bevel, and chamfer. Document [21] also discusses the effect of abutment finish line curvature on the fit of all-ceramic CAD/CAM crowns and metal-ceramic crowns. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that the finish line used in complete metal cast crown can be either chamfer, shoulder, or chamfer with bevel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Chamfer, B. Chafer with bevel, C. Feather edge, D. Shoulder\"}"
