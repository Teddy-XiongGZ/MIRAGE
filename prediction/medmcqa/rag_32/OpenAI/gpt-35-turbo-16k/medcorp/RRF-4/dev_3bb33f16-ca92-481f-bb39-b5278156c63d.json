    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has increased PT, APTT, and TT, which are all prolonged clotting times. This suggests a deficiency or dysfunction in the clotting factors involved in the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation. Since the fibrinogen and platelet counts are normal, it is unlikely to be DIC or a platelet disorder. Vitamin K deficiency primarily affects the extrinsic pathway, leading to increased PT but not APTT or TT. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is liver disease, as it can affect both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and lead to prolonged clotting times.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Liver disease\"}"
