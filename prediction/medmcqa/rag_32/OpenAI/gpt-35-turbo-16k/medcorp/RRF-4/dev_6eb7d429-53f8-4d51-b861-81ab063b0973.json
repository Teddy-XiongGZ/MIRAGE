    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resin teeth are artificial teeth used in dental restorations. To determine the characteristics of resin teeth, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] discusses the wear behavior of different artificial resin teeth. It states that the wear behavior of the artificial teeth examined differed with regard to their compositions. Document [14] compares the wear resistance of resin and ceramic denture teeth. It mentions that composite resin teeth showed improved wear resistance compared to modern acrylic resin denture teeth, but less wear resistance than ceramic teeth and human enamel. Based on this information, we can conclude that resin teeth do not show a high compressive strength (choice A) or a high fracture strength (choice D). Document [2] and [14] do not provide information about contraindications in patients with decreased inter occlusal distance (choice B). However, document [14] mentions that composite resin teeth are used for restoring anterior teeth in children, which suggests that they can be used in patients with normal inter occlusal distance. Document [14] also does not mention crazing (choice C) as a characteristic of resin teeth. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Show a high fracture strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
