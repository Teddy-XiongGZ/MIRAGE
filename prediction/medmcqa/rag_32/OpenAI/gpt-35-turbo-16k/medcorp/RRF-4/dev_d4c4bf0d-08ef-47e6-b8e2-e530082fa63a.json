    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Narrow angle glaucoma is a condition where the angle between the iris and the cornea is narrow, which can lead to a blockage of the drainage system of the eye and increased intraocular pressure. The question asks which drug should not be given in a patient with narrow angle glaucoma. To determine the answer, we need to review the information in the relevant documents regarding drugs and narrow angle glaucoma. Document [2] states that serotonergic psychoactive drugs should be prescribed cautiously in patients with known narrow angles and should be monitored by an ophthalmologist. Document [3] mentions that psychoactive drugs should be prescribed cautiously in patients with known narrow angles and should be monitored by an ophthalmologist. Document [7] reports a case of aggravation of narrow-angle glaucoma with the use of fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor. Document [9] describes two cases of increased ocular pressure in patients with narrow angle glaucoma treated with venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Based on this information, it can be concluded that drugs with serotonergic activity, such as fluvoxamine and venlafaxine, should not be given in a patient with narrow angle glaucoma. Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options. \", \"answer_choice\": \"Not provided in the options\"}"
