    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Medial squint refers to a convergent strabismus, where the affected eye deviates inward towards the nose. To determine the cause of medial squint, we need to identify the nerve responsible for controlling the movement of the medial rectus muscle, which is responsible for adduction or inward movement of the eye.
