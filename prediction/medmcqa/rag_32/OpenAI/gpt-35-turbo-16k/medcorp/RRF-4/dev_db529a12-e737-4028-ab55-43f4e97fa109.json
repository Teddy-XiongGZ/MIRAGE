    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactose intolerance is caused by lactase deficiency, which results in the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. The severity of lactose intolerance can vary among individuals. In general, lactose intolerance is more likely to occur with higher lactose content in the food. Skimmed milk and condensed milk both contain high levels of lactose and are therefore more likely to cause lactose intolerance. Ice cream also contains lactose, but the presence of fat and other ingredients may affect the digestion of lactose. Yogurt, on the other hand, is usually well tolerated by lactose intolerant individuals due to the presence of living lactic acid bacteria and lactase in fermented dairy products. Therefore, the least likely agent to cause lactose intolerance among the given choices is C. Yogurt.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
