    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, dental caries is primarily caused by acidogenic bacteria. These bacteria produce acids, such as lactic acid, through the fermentation of dietary carbohydrates, leading to demineralization of the tooth enamel. While other bacteria, such as Actinomyces spp., may also play a role in the caries process, acidogenic bacteria are specifically mentioned as the main bacteria responsible for the progression of dental caries. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Acidogenic bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
