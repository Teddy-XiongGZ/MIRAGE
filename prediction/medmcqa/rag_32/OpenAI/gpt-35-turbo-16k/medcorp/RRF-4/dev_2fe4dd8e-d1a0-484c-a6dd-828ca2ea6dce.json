    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of the TMJ, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular portion (V3) of the trigeminal nerve, innervates the lateral capsule of the TMJ. Document [2] confirms this by stating that calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive nerve fibers, which are sensory fibers, are found in the capsule of the TMJ. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Auriculotemporal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
