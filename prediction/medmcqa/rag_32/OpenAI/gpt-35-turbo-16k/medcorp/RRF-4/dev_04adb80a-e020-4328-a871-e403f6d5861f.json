    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which appliance is not used for slow maxillary expansion, we need to review the relevant documents and identify the appliances that are mentioned in the context of slow maxillary expansion. Document [1] mentions the use of the quad helix appliance for slow maxillary expansion. Document [5] also mentions the use of a bonded maxillary expansion appliance for slow maxillary expansion. However, there is no mention of the jack screw or the coffin spring in the context of slow maxillary expansion in any of the documents. Therefore, the correct answer is either A. Jack screw or B. Coffin spring. To confirm the correct answer, we need to review the remaining documents. Document [12] lists different types of expanders, including the jack screw and the coffin spring, but it does not specify whether they are used for slow maxillary expansion. Document [28] mentions the quad helix appliance as an alternative approach to rapid maxillary expansion, but it does not mention the jack screw or the coffin spring. Based on this information, we can conclude that the appliance not used for slow maxillary expansion is either A. Jack screw or B. Coffin spring. However, without further information, we cannot determine which one is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
