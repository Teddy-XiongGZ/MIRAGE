    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The loading dose of MgSO4 (IV) is typically prepared as a 50% w/v solution. The total volume of the loading dose is usually 20 ml. To calculate the amount of MgSO4 and NS needed, we can use the formula: (volume of 50% w/v MgSO4) + (volume of NS) = 20 ml. Let's calculate the options one by one:\\n\\nOption A: 4 ml 50% w/v + 16 ml NS = 20 ml\\nOption B: 8 ml 50% w/v + 12 ml NS = 20 ml\\nOption C: 12 ml 50% w/v + 8 ml NS = 20 ml\\nOption D: 16 ml 50% w/v + 4 ml NS = 20 ml\\n\\nAll of the options have a total volume of 20 ml, so they are all correct. However, the most commonly used loading dose is 4 g (8 ml of 50% w/v MgSO4) followed by a maintenance dose, so Option A (4 ml 50% w/v + 16 ml NS) is the most likely choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
