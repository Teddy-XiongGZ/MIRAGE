    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which group of people the PCV 23 polysaccharide vaccine has shown the best results in, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [6] states that the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) is suitable only for patients over two years of age. Document [7] mentions that the pneumococcal vaccine reduces the risk of serious pneumococcal infection by an estimated 50% to 80%. Document [8] states that the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) has a clinical effectiveness of 43-81%. Document [9] indicates that the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV) is recommended in elderly and high-risk adults, and its effectiveness in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among people over 60 years of age is confirmed. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the PCV 23 polysaccharide vaccine has shown the best results in the elderly and high-risk adults, which includes individuals with conditions such as sickle cell anemia (choice A), cystic fibrosis (choice B), and recurrent otitis media and sinusitis (choice D). However, there is no specific mention of the vaccine's effectiveness in children less than 2 years of age (choice C). Therefore, the correct answer is either A, B, or D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/D\"}"
