    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucogenic amino acids can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis involves the conversion of amino acids to alpha keto acids and then to glucose. Pyruvate and oxaloacetate are both intermediates in the gluconeogenesis pathway and can be converted to glucose. Lactate is also a substrate for gluconeogenesis and can be converted to glucose. However, acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to glucose and is not a glucogenic substrate. Therefore, the answer is C. Acetyl-CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
