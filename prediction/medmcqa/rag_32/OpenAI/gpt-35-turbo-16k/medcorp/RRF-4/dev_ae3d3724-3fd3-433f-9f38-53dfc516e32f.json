    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At resting membrane potential (RMP), there is no net electrogenic transfer, which means that the driving force for ion Z is balanced by the membrane potential. Since the membrane potential is given as V = -30, the equilibrium potential for ion Z must also be -30 mV. According to the Nernst equation, the equilibrium potential is calculated as E = RT/zF * log([ion outside the cell]/[ion inside of the cell]). Since the equilibrium potential is -30 mV, the logarithmic term must be equal to 1. Therefore, [ion outside the cell]/[ion inside of the cell] = 1. This implies that the concentration of ion Z is the same inside and outside the cell. Hence, the value of Z is 0.\", \"answer_choice\": \"0\"}"
