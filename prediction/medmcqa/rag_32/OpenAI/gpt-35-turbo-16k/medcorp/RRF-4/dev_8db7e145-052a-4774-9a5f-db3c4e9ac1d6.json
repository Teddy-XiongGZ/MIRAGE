    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information about the correlation between humerus length and height. However, Document [4] provides information about the growth of the humerus in children. Document [14] discusses the correlation between height and ulna length in adults. Since there is no specific information about the correlation between humerus length and height, it is not possible to accurately predict the height of a person based solely on the length of their humerus. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined with the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
