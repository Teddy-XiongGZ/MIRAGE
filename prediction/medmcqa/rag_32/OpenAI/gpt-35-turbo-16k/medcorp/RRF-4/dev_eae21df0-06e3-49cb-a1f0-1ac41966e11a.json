    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the first instrument used on the facial surfaces of gingiva during gingivectomy, we need to find information about the instruments used in gingivectomy. Document [5] mentions that the instrument of choice for gingivectomy is a gingivectomy knife. Therefore, we need to find the specific type of gingivectomy knife used. After searching through the documents, there is no specific mention of Orban's knife, Kirkland's knife, BP blade with No. 11 blade, or BP blade with No. 12 blade. Therefore, we cannot determine the first instrument used on the facial surfaces of gingiva during gingivectomy based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
