    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To know the position and integrity of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), the best method would be to perform a plain radiograph. Plain radiographs can provide information about the position and integrity of the ICD leads and generator. CECT (contrast-enhanced computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may provide more detailed information, but they are not typically the first-line imaging modalities for evaluating the position and integrity of an ICD. USG (ultrasound) is not commonly used for evaluating ICDs. Therefore, the best choice would be D. Plain radiograph.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
