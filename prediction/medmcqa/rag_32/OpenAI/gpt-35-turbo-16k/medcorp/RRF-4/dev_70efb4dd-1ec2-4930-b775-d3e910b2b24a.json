    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A flexible major connector can cause ill-fitting of RPD. The major connector is the major component of the cast partial denture that provides cross arch stability and resistance to deformation. A flexible major connector can result in an unequal distribution of forces and changes in their intensity, leading to an ill-fitting RPD. It does not necessarily cause PDL destruction of abutment teeth or difficulty in occlusion. It may or may not make other components more effective depending on the specific situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
