    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of recurrent optic neuritis bilaterally with transverse myelitis, which is suggestive of a demyelinating disorder. The visual acuity in the right eye is 6/60 and in the left eye is 6/18. The patient showed a 50% response to steroids. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Neuromyelitis Optica (Choice A). Neuromyelitis Optica is characterized by recurrent optic neuritis and transverse myelitis, often with bilateral involvement. The response to steroids can vary, but a partial response is not uncommon. Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord (Choice B) is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and typically presents with sensory ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, not optic neuritis. Post cerebral artery stroke (Choice C) would not explain the recurrent nature of the symptoms. Neuro-syphilis (Choice D) can cause optic neuritis, but it is less likely given the bilateral involvement and the response to steroids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
