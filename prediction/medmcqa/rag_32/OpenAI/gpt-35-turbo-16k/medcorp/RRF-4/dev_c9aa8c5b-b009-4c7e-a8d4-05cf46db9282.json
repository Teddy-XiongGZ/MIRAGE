    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in the case received a higher dose of epidural morphine (12 mg) mistakenly. We need to determine the potential side effects of this higher dose of morphine. Looking at the relevant documents, we can see that itching (pruritus) is a common side effect of morphine, but it is not mentioned as a symptom in the case. Urinary retention is another potential side effect of morphine, but it is also not mentioned in the case. Increase in vomiting is not a known side effect of morphine. Overstimulation of the respiratory center is a potential side effect of high doses of opioids, including morphine. Given that the patient experienced retching and vomiting, it is possible that the higher dose of morphine could have overstimulated the respiratory center, leading to these symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Overstimulation of respiratory centre.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
