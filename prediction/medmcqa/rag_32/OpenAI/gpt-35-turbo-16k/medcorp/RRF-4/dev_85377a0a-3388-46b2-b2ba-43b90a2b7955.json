    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which vaccine is effective for mass vaccination post-disaster, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses a vaccination campaign in Haiti after an earthquake, but it does not specify the type of vaccine used. Document [3] mentions a mass vaccination campaign using oral cholera vaccines in Aceh province, Indonesia, following the 2004 tsunami. Document [12] describes a mass vaccination campaign against measles in Aila cyclone-affected areas of West Bengal, India. Document [23] discusses the use of oral cholera vaccine as a potential adjunct measure to control a cholera outbreak in Pohnpei Island.
