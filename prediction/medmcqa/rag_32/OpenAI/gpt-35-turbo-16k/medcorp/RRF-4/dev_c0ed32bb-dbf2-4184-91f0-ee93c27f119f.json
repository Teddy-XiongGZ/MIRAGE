    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the reason why the transport of CO is diffusion limited. To answer this, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] mentions that the transport of inert gases, including CO, in the mammalian myocardium is more dispersed compared to other gases, likely due to differences in diffusibility and solubility. Document [4] states that CO(2), but not HCO(3-), crosses the lipid bilayer membrane, indicating that CO can diffuse through membranes. Document [16] mentions that CO(2) diffusion in leaves can be variable and that the membranes may play a role in CO(2) diffusion. Based on this information, we can conclude that the transport of CO is diffusion limited because it can diffuse through membranes and its diffusibility and solubility may contribute to its dispersion. Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the given choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
