A syndesmosis is a type of fibrous joint where the bones are connected by a ligament or a sheet of fibrous tissue, allowing for limited movement. A suture is a type of fibrous joint found only in the skull, where the bones are connected by dense fibrous connective tissue. A synchondrosis is a type of cartilaginous joint, and a saddle joint is a type of synovial joint. Therefore, the correct answer is either A. Syndesmosis or D. Suture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/D\"}"
