Has a slow rate of turnover: Document [6] mentions that the periodontal ligament is an area of high turnover, which indicates that it does not have a slow rate of turnover.\\n\\nC. Contains epithelial cells of malassez: Document [2] mentions that the cells of the periodontal ligament include epithelial cell rests of Malassez, which indicates that it does contain epithelial cells of malassez.\\n\\nD. Comprises primarily of type 2 collagen: There is no mention of the periodontal ligament comprising primarily of type 2 collagen in any of the documents. However, Document [2] mentions that the periodontal ligament consists of mostly Type I and III collagen.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C.
