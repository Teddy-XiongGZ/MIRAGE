    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct angle at which to take an X-ray for root fracture, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. Document [3] states that peri-apical radiographs can often identify horizontal root fractures. However, document [27] suggests that the occurrence of vertical and horizontal root fractures is different among different tooth types. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility of both horizontal and vertical root fractures. None of the documents explicitly mention the specific angle at which X-rays should be taken for root fractures. Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine the correct angle for X-rays. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be determined from the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
