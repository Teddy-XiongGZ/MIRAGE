    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resistance form in endodontics refers to the ability of the root canal system to resist fracture during obturation procedures. It involves creating a shape and taper of the canal that allows for effective condensation of the filling material without causing root fracture. The resistance form is important to prevent complications such as vertical root fracture. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Fracture of root while vertical condensation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
