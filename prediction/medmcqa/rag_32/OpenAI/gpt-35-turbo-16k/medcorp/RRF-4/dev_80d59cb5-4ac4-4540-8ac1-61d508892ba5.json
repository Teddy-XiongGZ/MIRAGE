    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, preganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel to the otic ganglion from the glossopharyngeal nerve. Document [2] states that the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers arise in the inferior salivary nucleus, located within the medulla oblongata of the brainstem, and pass through the glossopharyngeal nerve. They then travel with its tympanic branch (Jacobson\u2019s nerve) to form the tympanic plexus in the middle ear cavity, before leaving it to form the lesser petrosal nerve. The lesser petrosal nerve courses along the floor of the middle cranial fossa and exits the skull base through the foramen ovale to enter the infratemporal fossa and join the otic ganglion. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Glossopharyngeal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
