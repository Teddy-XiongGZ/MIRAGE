    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the acid-base status based on the given values, we need to analyze the pH, pCO2, and pO2. The pH value of 7.46 indicates alkalosis, as it is above the normal range of 7.35-7.45. The pCO2 value of 30 mm Hg is below the normal range of 35-45 mm Hg, indicating respiratory alkalosis. The pO2 value of 105 mm Hg is within the normal range. Therefore, the profile indicates respiratory alkalosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Respiratory alkalosis\"}"
