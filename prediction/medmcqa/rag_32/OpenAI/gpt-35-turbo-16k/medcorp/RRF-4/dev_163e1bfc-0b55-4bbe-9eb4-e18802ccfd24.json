    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tooth the mesial marginal developmental groove is seen in, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] describes the maxillary lateral incisor and mentions the presence of mesial and distal marginal ridges and a cingulum. Document [1] describes the maxillary central incisor and mentions the presence of a cingulum and a lingual fossa. Document [3] mentions that the mandibular central and lateral incisors have the fewest developmental grooves. Document [7] describes the mandibular second premolar and mentions the presence of a groove pattern shaped like a 'U' or 'H'. Based on this information, the tooth that has a mesial marginal developmental groove is the Maxillary lateral incisor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
