    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which muscle does NOT work for inversion of the foot, we need to identify the muscles that are involved in foot inversion. According to the documents, the muscles that contribute to foot inversion are the tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus. The extensor hallucis longus muscle, on the other hand, extends the big toe, dorsiflexes the foot, and assists with foot eversion and inversion. Therefore, the muscle that does NOT work for inversion of the foot is the Extensor hallucis longus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
