    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prepare a cavity on a mandibular first molar in a child, we need to consider the nerve blocks that provide adequate anesthesia for the procedure. The mandibular first molar is innervated by the inferior alveolar nerve, which supplies the pulpal and periodontal tissues of the tooth. The long buccal nerve supplies the buccal gingiva and mucosa. The mental nerve supplies the lower lip and chin, while the lingual nerve supplies the lingual gingiva and mucosa. Therefore, to ensure complete anesthesia for the cavity preparation, we should give an inferior alveolar nerve block to anesthetize the pulpal and periodontal tissues of the mandibular first molar, as well as a long buccal nerve block to anesthetize the buccal gingiva and mucosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
