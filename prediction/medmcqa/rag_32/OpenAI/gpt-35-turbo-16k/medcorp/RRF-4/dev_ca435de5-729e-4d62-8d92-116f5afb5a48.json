    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the Nernst potential for a negative ion, we can use the Nernst equation: E = (RT/zF) * ln([ion outside the cell]/[ion inside the cell]). Given that the concentration of the negative ion is 100 mMoUL extracellular and 10 mMo1/1 intracellular, we can substitute these values into the equation. The valence (z) for a negative ion is -1. The temperature (T) is not given, so we will assume it is at standard body temperature (37\u00b0C or 310 K). The gas constant (R) is 8.314 J\u00b7K-1\u00b7mol-1, and Faraday's constant (F) is 96,485 C\u00b7mol-1. Plugging in these values, we can calculate the Nernst potential.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
