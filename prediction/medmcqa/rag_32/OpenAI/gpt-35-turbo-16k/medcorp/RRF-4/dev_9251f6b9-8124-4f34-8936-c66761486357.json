    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, we need to review the relevant documents for information on the recommended procedure for immediate composite restoration following intracoronal bleaching. Document [4] mentions a modified walking bleach technique that minimizes the risks of cervical resorption. Document [6] also discusses a modified walking bleach technique that reduces treatment time and eliminates residual hydrogen peroxide. Document [9] suggests that immediate composite restoration can be done following intracoronal bleaching. Document [13] mentions the use of alternative bleaching agents that are effective and safe.
