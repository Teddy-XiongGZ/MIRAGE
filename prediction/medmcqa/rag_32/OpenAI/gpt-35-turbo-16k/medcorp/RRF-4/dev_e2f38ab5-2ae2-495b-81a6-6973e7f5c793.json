    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After the removal of the periodontal pack, the presence of a large round elevated granulation tissue is not a normal finding. It suggests an abnormal tissue response. Allergy to components in the pack is a possibility, but it is less likely as it would typically present with other symptoms such as itching or rash.
