    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common site for congenital cholesteatoma, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that the most common sites of presentation on physical examination are the anterior-superior and posterior-superior quadrants of the tympanic membrane. Document [21] also mentions that congenital cholesteatoma in Japanese patients is more likely to involve the posterior-type cholesteatomas, which do not exist anteriorly beyond the handle of the malleus. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the most common site for congenital cholesteatoma is the posterior superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
