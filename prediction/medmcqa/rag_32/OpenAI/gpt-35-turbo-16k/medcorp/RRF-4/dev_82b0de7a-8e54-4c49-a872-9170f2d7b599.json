    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the definition of the pressure in the vascular system in the absence of blood flow. To determine the answer, we need to analyze the provided documents. Document [6] states that arterial pressure is determined by the volume ejected by the heart into the arteries, the elastance of the walls of the arteries, and the rate at which the blood flows out of the arteries. Document [15] mentions that mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Document [17] explains that veins are described as the 'capacitance vessels' of the body because over 70% of the blood volume resides in the venous system. Based on this information, we can conclude that the pressure in the vascular system in the absence of blood flow is the mean circulatory filling pressure, which represents the pressure in the arteries and veins when blood is not actively flowing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Mean circulatory filling pressure\"}"
