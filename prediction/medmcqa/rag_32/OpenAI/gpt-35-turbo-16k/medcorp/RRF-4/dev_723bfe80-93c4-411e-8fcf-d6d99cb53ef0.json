    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the minimum width required in the ridge for placing 2 implants of size 4 mm, we need to consider the diameter of the implants and any additional space required for proper placement. Each implant has a diameter of 4 mm, so the total width required for both implants would be 8 mm. However, it is generally recommended to have some additional space between the implants to ensure proper spacing and support. Based on the available documents, there is no specific recommendation for the amount of additional space required. Therefore, we can assume a conservative estimate of 2 mm of additional space between the implants. Adding this to the total implant diameter, the minimum width required in the ridge would be 10 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"10 mm\"}"
