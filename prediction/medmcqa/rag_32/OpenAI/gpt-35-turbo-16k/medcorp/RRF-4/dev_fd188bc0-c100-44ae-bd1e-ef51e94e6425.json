    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the false statement about enamel rods. The documents mention that enamel rods are tightly packed, highly organized masses of hydroxyapatite crystals. They are hexagonal in shape and provide rigidity to the rods and strengthen the enamel. The documents also mention that enamel rods are not perpendicular to the tooth surface, but rather have a keyhole shape with the head oriented toward the crown of the tooth and the tail oriented toward the root of the tooth. Additionally, the documents state that the diameter of enamel rods is 4 \u03bcm wide to 8 \u03bcm high. Therefore, the false statement about enamel rods is that their diameter is 30 micrometers at the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
