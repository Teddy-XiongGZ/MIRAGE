    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the distance between the apical constriction and the apical foramen is mentioned in Document [0]. The mean distance of AC-AF (apical constriction to apical foramen) is 0.2 mm (99% confidence interval, 0.15-0.24; range, 0-0.6 mm). Therefore, the apical constriction is 0-0.5 mm coronal to the apical foramen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 0-0.5\"}"
