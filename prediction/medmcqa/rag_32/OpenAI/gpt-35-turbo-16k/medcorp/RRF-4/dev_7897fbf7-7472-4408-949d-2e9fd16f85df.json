    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Root end resection is the removal of the apex of a root during endodontic surgery. To determine the length of root end resection, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [6] mentions a study where 3mm of root end was resected. Document [10] also mentions a study where root end resection was performed with a depth of 3-4mm. Document [19] describes a case series where root end resection was performed, but does not specify the length. Based on the information from these documents, it can be concluded that root end resection is typically done with a length of 3-4mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 3mm\"}"
