    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is 16 years old and has primary amenorrhea, which is the absence of menstruation by the age of 15 years in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. She has well-developed breasts (Tanner's stage 5) but minimal pubic hair (Tanner's stage 1). This pattern suggests that she has normal estrogen production and breast development but inadequate androgen exposure for pubic hair development. The most probable diagnosis in this case is Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), also known as Testicular feminization syndrome. In AIS, individuals with a 46,XY karyotype have a mutation in the androgen receptor gene, resulting in a lack of response to androgens. This leads to the development of female external genitalia and breast development, but minimal or absent pubic hair and primary amenorrhea. Turner's syndrome (choice B) is characterized by a 45,X karyotype and typically presents with short stature, primary amenorrhea, and features such as webbed neck and lymphedema. Premature ovarian failure (choice A) is characterized by the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 and can present with primary or secondary amenorrhea. M\u00fcllerian agenesis (choice C), also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome, is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper vagina, but normal secondary sexual characteristics. This patient has normal breast development, indicating the presence of a uterus. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
