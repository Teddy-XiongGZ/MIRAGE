    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the radiopacity that frequently obliterates the root apices of maxillary molars, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [6] discusses the relationship between the apices of maxillary posterior teeth (including molars) and the maxillary sinus floor. Document [16] also mentions the proximity of the vascular bone channel in the lateral sinus wall to the root apices of maxillary first molars. Document [22] presents a case report of a pseudocyst of the maxillary sinus associated with a maxillary second molar. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the radiopacity that frequently obliterates the root apices of maxillary molars is the maxillary sinus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
