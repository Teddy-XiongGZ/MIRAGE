    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the sensitivity of a vaccine due to heat, we need to consider the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the evaluation of thermostability of lyophilized BCG vaccines, but it does not mention any specific parameter used to determine sensitivity to heat. Document [3] discusses the stability of freeze-dried and reconstituted measles vaccines, but it does not mention any specific parameter either. Document [8] discusses the potency of oral polio vaccine kept outside of the cold chain, but it does not provide information on the sensitivity to heat. Document [13] discusses the thermo-tolerability of the lyophilized V4 vaccine against Newcastle disease, but it does not mention any specific parameter used to determine sensitivity to heat. None of the other documents seem to provide relevant information on the sensitivity of vaccines to heat. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot determine which parameter is used to determine the sensitivity of a vaccine due to heat.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
