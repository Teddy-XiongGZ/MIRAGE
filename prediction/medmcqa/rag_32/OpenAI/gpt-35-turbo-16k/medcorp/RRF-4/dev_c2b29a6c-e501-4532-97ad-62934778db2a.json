    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is a solid solution, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] states that substitutional solid solutions may form if the solute and solvent have similar atomic radii, same crystal structure, similar electronegativities, and similar valency. Document [1] provides examples of solid solutions, including mercury in gold (forming an amalgam) and silver-palladium. Document [4] also mentions that many metal alloys are solid solutions. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is C. Silver-palladium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
