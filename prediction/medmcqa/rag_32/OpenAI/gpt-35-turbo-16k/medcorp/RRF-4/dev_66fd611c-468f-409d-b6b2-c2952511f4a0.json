    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the shape of the 1st Maxillary molar, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] describes the occlusal surface of the maxillary first molar, stating that it consists of the mesiobuccal, distolingual, mesiolingual, and distobuccal cusps. Document [13] provides further information, stating that the maxillary first molar normally has four cusps, two buccal and two lingual. Based on this information, we can conclude that the shape of the 1st Maxillary molar is not a rhomboid, rounded triangular, or square, but rather a trapezoid, as it has four cusps.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Trapezoid\"}"
