    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, creep is the tendency of a solid material to slowly move or deform permanently under constant stresses. Creep tests measure the strain response due to a constant stress. The creep curve usually shows three phases: primary creep, secondary creep, and tertiary creep. In primary creep, the rate of flow decreases over time. In secondary creep, the strain rate is constant. In tertiary creep, there is an increase in the strain rate up to the fracture strain. Therefore, the decrease in creep occurs in the primary creep stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
