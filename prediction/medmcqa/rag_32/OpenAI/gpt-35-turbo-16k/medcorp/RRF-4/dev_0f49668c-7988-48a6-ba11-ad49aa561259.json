His 6-year-old son also has similar skin lesions. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Xeroderma pigmentosum, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light and an increased risk of skin cancer. Xeroderma pigmentosum is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both parents must carry a copy of the mutated gene for the condition to be passed on to their children. Neurofibromatosis-1 and neurofibromatosis-2 are not associated with skin lesions and intracranial calcification. Autosomal dominant inheritance is a general term that does not specify a specific condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Xeroderma pigmentosum\"}"
