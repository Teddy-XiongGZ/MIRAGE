    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, there is no specific age mentioned for the start of root resorption. However, Document [2] mentions that in rats, both young and adult rats had the same incidence of root resorption in the early phase (<4 weeks), and both increased in the late phase (4-12 weeks) to the same level. This suggests that root resorption can occur as early as 4 weeks of age in rats. Since the question does not specify the species, we cannot definitively determine the age at which root resorption starts. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not provided\"}"
