    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information can be found in Document [8] which discusses the force generated by finger springs in removable orthodontic appliances. According to the document, a force of 30-50 g is required to tip a single-rooted tooth, with an activation of about 3 mm for a spring with a load/deflection rate (LDR) of 15 g/mm. Since the question asks about the force generated by a 90\u00b0 rotation of the finger spring in the pendulum appliance, we can assume that the force generated is within the range of 30-50 g. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
