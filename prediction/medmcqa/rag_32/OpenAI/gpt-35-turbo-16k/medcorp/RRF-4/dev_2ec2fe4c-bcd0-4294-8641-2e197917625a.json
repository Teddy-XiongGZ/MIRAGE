    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which enzyme does not use Acetyl Co-A as a substrate, we need to examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Acetyl Co-A is involved in various metabolic pathways, including the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. We need to identify the enzyme that does not participate in these pathways. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. HMG-CoA synthase: HMG-CoA synthase is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and ketone bodies. It uses Acetyl Co-A as a substrate, so it is not the correct answer.\\n\\nB. Malic enzyme: Malic enzyme is involved in the conversion of malate to pyruvate. It does not directly use Acetyl Co-A as a substrate, so it is a potential candidate.\\n\\nC. Malonyl CoA synthetase: Malonyl CoA synthetase is involved in the synthesis of malonyl Co-A, which is an important intermediate in fatty acid synthesis. It uses Acetyl Co-A as a substrate, so it is not the correct answer.\\n\\nD. Fatty acid synthetase: Fatty acid synthetase is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids. It uses Acetyl Co-A as a substrate, so it is not the correct answer.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Malic enzyme, as it does not directly use Acetyl Co-A as a substrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
