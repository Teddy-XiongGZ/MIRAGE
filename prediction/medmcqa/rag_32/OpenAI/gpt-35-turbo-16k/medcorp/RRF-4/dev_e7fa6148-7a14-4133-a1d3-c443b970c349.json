    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common chance of pulpal exposure when the pulpal floor is made perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth, we need to consider the anatomy and position of the teeth. The maxillary 1st premolar and mandibular 1st premolar have a single root, which makes it less likely for the pulpal floor to be perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. The mandibular 2nd premolar also has a single root, but it is less commonly affected by pulpal exposure compared to the maxillary teeth. The maxillary 1st molar, on the other hand, has multiple roots and a larger pulpal chamber, making it more susceptible to pulpal exposure when the pulpal floor is made perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Therefore, the most common chance of pulpal exposure would be in the maxillary 1st molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
