    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which metal alloy reduces the hardness of orthodontic wires, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] discusses the mechanical properties of different orthodontic wires, including the hardness. Document [4] investigates the effects of different heat treatments and alloy compositions on the behavior of NiTi orthodontic wires. Document [16] assesses the hardness of orthodontic brackets and wires produced by different methods. Document [22] characterizes the mechanical properties of orthodontic wires using instrumented indentation testing. Based on these documents, we can conclude that the metal alloy that reduces the hardness of orthodontic wires is Nickel-Titanium (NiTi).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Carbon\"}"
