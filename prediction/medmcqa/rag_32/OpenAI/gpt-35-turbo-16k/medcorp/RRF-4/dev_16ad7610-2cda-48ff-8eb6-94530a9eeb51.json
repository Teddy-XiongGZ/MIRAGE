    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options indicate fetal lung maturity, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] states that a ratio of 1.11 between lung and liver represents the borderline between pulmonary immaturity and maturity. Lower values indicate maturity. Document [6] mentions that most methods for assessing fetal lung maturity depend on the detection of surfactant in the amniotic fluid. Document [8] states that the L/S ratio is the most widely used biochemical method for assessing fetal lung maturity. Document [13] mentions that a lecithin:sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio of 2.0 or greater correlates well with fetal maturity. Document [17] discusses the surface tension characteristics of amniotic fluid as an indicator of fetal lung maturity. Based on this information, we can conclude that options A, B, and C (Lecithin/Sphingomyelin ratio >2, Positive shake test, Increased phosphatidyl glycerol) indicate fetal lung maturity. Therefore, the answer is D. Blue cells in Nile Blue Test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
