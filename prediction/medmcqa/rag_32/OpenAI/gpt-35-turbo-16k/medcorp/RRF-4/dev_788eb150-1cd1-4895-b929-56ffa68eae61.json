    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) levels can be used as a screening test for certain developmental abnormalities. In Down's syndrome, MSAFP levels are typically lower than normal. Omphalocele and gastroschisis are both abdominal wall defects, and they can be associated with elevated MSAFP levels. Spina bifida occulta is a neural tube defect, and it can also be associated with elevated MSAFP levels. Therefore, the highest MSAFP values would be expected in either omphalocele or gastroschisis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
