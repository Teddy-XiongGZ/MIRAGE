    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is false in relation to myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome (MPDS) is not primarily related to occlusal factors and a complex psycho physiological mechanism is involved in this type of pain problems. Document [14] mentions that myofacial pain dysfunction (MPD) is a musculoskeletal dysfunction involving malrelationship among the neuromuscular system, temporomandibular joints, and dental occlusion. Document [20] discusses masticatory myofascial pain syndrome, which can present similarly to other dental conditions in odontogenetic structures. Based on this information, we can conclude that statement C is false because treatment for myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome does not necessarily involve construction of an occlusal guard and stress-free emotional condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
