    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars can be determined by analyzing the relevant documents. Document [7] states that radiographic changes associated with pulp infection in primary incisor roots and their developing permanent dental follicles include inflammatory root resorption, pulp pathosis, deep caries, past traumatic injury, enlarged dental sac, loss of lamina dura of the dental sac, and increased radiolucency of the dental sac of the corresponding permanent tooth bud. Document [13] mentions that signs and symptoms of pulpal necrosis include periapical radiolucency. Based on this information, the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars is likely to be periapical radiolucency, which indicates periapical bony changes. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Periapical bony changes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
