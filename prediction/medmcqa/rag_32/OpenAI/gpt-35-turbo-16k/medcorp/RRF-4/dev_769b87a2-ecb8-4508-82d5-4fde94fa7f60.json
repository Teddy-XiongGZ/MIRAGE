    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child spends 8 years of life in a temperate climate where the drinking water had fluoride of 3 ppm. This high concentration of fluoride in the drinking water can lead to dental fluorosis, which affects the enamel of the teeth. Dental fluorosis is most commonly seen in the permanent teeth, as they are developing during the time of exposure to high levels of fluoride. Therefore, the teeth that are most likely to be affected are the permanent teeth. However, it is important to note that the severity of dental fluorosis can vary, and not all permanent teeth may be affected. The third molars, also known as wisdom teeth, may not be fully developed during the time of exposure and may therefore be less likely to be affected. Based on this information, the answer choice that best fits is B. All permanent teeth, except third molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
