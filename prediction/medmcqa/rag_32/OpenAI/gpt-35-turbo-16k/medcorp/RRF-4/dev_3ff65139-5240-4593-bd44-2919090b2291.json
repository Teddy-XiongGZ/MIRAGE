    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information about the Chi-square test can be found in documents [1], [11], [21], [26], and [28]. From these documents, we can gather that the Chi-square test is used to analyze group differences when the dependent variable is measured at a nominal level. It is a non-parametric (distribution free) tool that is robust with respect to the distribution of the data. It is commonly used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table. Based on this information, we can conclude that the Chi-square test measures qualitative data, so the correct answer is A. Measures qualitative data.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
