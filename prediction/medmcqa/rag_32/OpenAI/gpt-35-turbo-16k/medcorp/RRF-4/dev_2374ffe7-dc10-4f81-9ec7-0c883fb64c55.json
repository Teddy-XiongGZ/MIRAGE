    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can evaluate each statement:\\n\\nA. It's an amide which is metabolised in both plasma and liver: This statement is true. Document [8] states that articaine is metabolized via hydrolysis in both the liver and blood serum.\\n\\nB. Plasma half-life is 90 min: This statement is false. Document [8] states that the elimination half-lives of articaine are 0.6 and 2.5 hours, while the half-life of the metabolite articainic acid is 2.5 hours.\\n\\nC. Infiltration produces adequate anaesthesia in primary molar so need for block anesthesia is eliminated: This statement is true. Document [19] states that many dental procedures on primary molars can be successfully accomplished with infiltration of articaine alone, which would significantly reduce the duration of soft tissue anesthesia and eliminate the need for block anesthesia.\\n\\nD. More breakdown cause less toxicity: This statement is false. Document [10] states that the rapid breakdown of articaine to the inactive metabolite articainic acid is related to a very low systemic toxicity and the possibility of repeated injections. However, it does not state that more breakdown causes less toxicity.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, the answer is D. More breakdown cause less toxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
