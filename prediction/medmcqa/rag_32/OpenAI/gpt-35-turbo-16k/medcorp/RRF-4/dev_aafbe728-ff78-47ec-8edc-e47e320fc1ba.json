    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The potential generated due to the movement of freely diffusible ions across a semi-permeable membrane is calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. This equation takes into account the permeability of different ions and their concentration gradients across the membrane. It is used to calculate the resting membrane potential in biological cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation\"}"
