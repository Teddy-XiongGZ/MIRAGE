    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is TRUE about propagated nerve action potential, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that the amplitude of the action potential decreases and pulse width increases during propagation, which suggests that the action potential is decremental. Therefore, option A is likely to be the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
