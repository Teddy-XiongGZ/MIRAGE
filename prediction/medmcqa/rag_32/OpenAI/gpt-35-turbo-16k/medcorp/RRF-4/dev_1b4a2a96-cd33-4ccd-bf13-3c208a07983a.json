    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with multiple rib injuries and is showing signs of respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 40/min. This indicates a potential risk of respiratory failure. The patient's blood pressure is also low, indicating possible hypovolemia. The next immediate step in management should be to provide urgent fluid infusion (B) to address the hypovolemia and stabilize the patient's blood pressure. Intubation (A) may be necessary if the patient's respiratory distress worsens or if there are signs of impending respiratory failure. Chest X-ray (C) may be performed to assess the extent of rib injuries and associated complications, but it is not the immediate priority in this case. Needle insertion in the 2nd intercostal space (D) may be considered for tension pneumothorax, but there is no indication of tension pneumothorax in the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
