This refers to the metabolism or decay of a drug prior to, during, or shortly after its enteral absorption, which reduces the amount of unchanged drug reaching the systemic circulation. It is a specific process that occurs in the liver or gut. Excretion refers to the removal of drugs from the body, which occurs after the drug has entered the systemic circulation.
