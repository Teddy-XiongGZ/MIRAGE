    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, T-lymphocytes play a primary role in the production of lymphokines and delayed hypersensitivity. T-lymphocytes are involved in the generation, maintenance, and specificity of the immune response, including the activation of other immune cells and the release of lymphokines, which are important for immune regulation and the coordination of immune responses. Antibody production is primarily carried out by B-lymphocytes, while the complement system is activated by a cascade of proteins and is not directly controlled by T-lymphocytes. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by IgE antibodies and mast cells, not T-lymphocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
