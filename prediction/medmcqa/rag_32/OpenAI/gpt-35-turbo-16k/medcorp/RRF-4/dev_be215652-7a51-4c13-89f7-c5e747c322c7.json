    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [5] states that the mandibular premolars have one large buccal cusp, especially the mandibular first premolar. Document [11] mentions that the mandibular second premolar has a larger crown compared to the mandibular first premolar. Document [13] describes the mandibular first premolar as having a dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual cusp. Document [22] states that the mandibular first premolar is an example of a premolar with only one functional cusp. Based on this information, we can conclude that the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars is that in the mandibular premolars, the buccal cusp is more prominent and the lingual cusp is smaller and less developed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
