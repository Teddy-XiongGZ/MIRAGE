    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no specific mention of the cross-sectional shape of the root that is most prone to vertical root fracture. The documents mainly discuss the factors influencing the occurrence of vertical root fractures, such as root canal anatomy, external root morphology, dentin thickness, and occlusal factors. However, there is no direct information about the relationship between the cross-sectional shape of the root and the susceptibility to vertical root fracture. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the correct answer based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unknown\"}"
