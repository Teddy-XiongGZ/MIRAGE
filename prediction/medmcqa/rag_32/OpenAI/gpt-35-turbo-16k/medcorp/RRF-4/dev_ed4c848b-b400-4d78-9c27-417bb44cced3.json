    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the highest incidence of atypical root canal or root among all teeth, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the prevalence of three-rooted mandibular first molars, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [1] mentions that anterior teeth, including mandibular incisors, may have aberrant anatomical variations in the number of roots and root canals, but it does not specify the highest incidence. Document [2] discusses extra roots and canals in premolar and molar teeth, but it does not provide information on the highest incidence. Document [3] focuses on the root and root canal morphology of the mandibular first premolar, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [4] discusses variations in root canal anatomy of mandibular molars, including the presence of additional roots, but it does not specify the highest incidence. Document [5] discusses the influence of missed canals on the prevalence of periapical lesions in endodontically treated teeth, but it does not provide information on the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [6] discusses the frequency of root canal treatment among patients attending a dental hospital, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [7] focuses on the root and canal symmetry in the mandibular anterior teeth, but it does not specify the highest incidence. Document [8] discusses the root canal morphology of maxillary second premolars, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [9] discusses atypical trigeminal neuralgia, which is not relevant to the question.

Document [12] discusses the number of roots and canals in maxillary first premolars, but it does not specify the highest incidence. Document [13] discusses the root canal morphology of mandibular permanent anterior teeth in an Iraqi subpopulation, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [14] discusses the root canal treatment of a mandibular second premolar with an atypical canal pattern, but it does not provide information on the highest incidence. Document [15] discusses the prevalence of endodontically treated teeth and procedural errors of root canal filling, but it does not specify the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [16] discusses the root and root canal morphology of human third molar teeth, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [17] discusses the root canal morphology of Indian maxillary premolars, but it does not specify the highest incidence. Document [18] discusses the root canal morphology of maxillary permanent first molar teeth, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [19] discusses the prevalence of apical periodontitis and the quality of root canal treatment, but it does not specify the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [20] discusses the root and canal morphology of maxillary first premolars in a Saudi population, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [21] discusses the prevalence of C-shaped root canals in the Iranian population, but it does not specify the highest incidence. Document [22] discusses the root and root canal morphology of the human mandibular second premolar, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [23] discusses the root canal treatment of a maxillary first premolar with three roots, but it does not provide information on the highest incidence. Document [24] discusses the root canal treatment in the General Dental Service, but it does not specify the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [25] discusses the root and canal morphology of mandibular third molars in an Iranian population, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [26] provides general information about root canal anatomy, but it does not specify the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [27] discusses the root and canal morphology of mandibular premolars in a Saudi subpopulation, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [28] discusses the root and canal morphology of mandibular premolars in a Saudi subpopulation using cone-beam computed tomography, but it does not specify the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [29] discusses the radiographic assessment of the quality of root canal fillings performed by senior dental students, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Document [30] discusses the prevalence of two root canals in human mandibular anterior teeth in an Iranian population, but it does not specify the highest incidence. Document [31] discusses the number of roots and canals in the maxillary second premolars in a Jordanian population, but it does not mention the highest incidence of atypical root canals or roots. Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, there is no specific mention of the highest incidence of atypical root canal or root among all teeth. Therefore, the answer to the question cannot be determined from the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
