    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the treatment of choice for a young patient with an irreparable tear of the rotator cuff is tendon transfer. Document [9] mentions that tendon transfer procedures are a viable option for younger patients without glenohumeral osteoarthritis and with severe functional limitation. Tendon transfers involve the transposition of surrounding muscles to replace the function of the rotator cuff. This procedure can provide pain relief and potential increase in strength. Total shoulder replacement (Choice B) and reverse shoulder replacement (Choice C) are typically reserved for older patients with glenohumeral arthritis and irreparable rotator cuff tears. Acromioplasty (Choice D) is a surgical procedure to remove a small portion of the acromion bone and is not the treatment of choice for an irreparable tear of the rotator cuff.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
