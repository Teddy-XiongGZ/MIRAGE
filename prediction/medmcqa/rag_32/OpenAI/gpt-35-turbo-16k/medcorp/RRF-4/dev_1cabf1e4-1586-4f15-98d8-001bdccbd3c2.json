    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vitamin K antagonizes the production of clotting factors by the liver. According to the documents, vitamin K is required for the activation of vitamin K-dependent proteins, including clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, inhibit the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is responsible for recycling vitamin K and reducing it back to its active form. This leads to a deficiency of reduced vitamin K and impairs the production of clotting factors by the liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
