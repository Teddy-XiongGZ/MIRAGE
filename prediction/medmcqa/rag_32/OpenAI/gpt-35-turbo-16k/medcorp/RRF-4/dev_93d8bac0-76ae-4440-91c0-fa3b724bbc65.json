    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options will not decrease mother to child transmission of HIV, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that treatment decreases the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to less than 5%. Document [3] mentions that effective intervention can reduce the risk of transmission to below 5%. Document [4] states that there was a significant decrease in HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission in the breastfeeding arm compared to the formula feeding arm. Document [9] mentions that without antiretroviral treatment, the risk of HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children is 15% to 30% during gestation or labor, with an additional transmission risk of 10% to 20% associated with prolonged breastfeeding. Based on this information, we can conclude that options A, C, and D (avoid breastfeeding, zidovudine given to mother antenatally and to neonate after birth, and vitamin A supplementation given to mother) can decrease mother to child transmission of HIV. Therefore, the answer is B. Vaginal delivery will not decrease mother to child transmission of HIV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
