    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a commonly used diagnostic procedure for various lesions, including thyroid nodules, breast lesions, and lung nodules. However, there are certain limitations to FNAC that may make it insufficient to diagnose certain types of cancers. To determine which cancer cannot be diagnosed solely by FNAC, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [27] states that FNAC has a high diagnostic accuracy for thyroid nodules, including follicular adenoma and carcinoma. Document [28] discusses the non-malignant categories of FNAC in breast lesions, indicating that FNAC is useful for diagnosing benign breast lesions. Document [31] mentions the role of FNAC and frozen section in the management of nodular goiters, suggesting that FNAC can be used to diagnose thyroid cancers. Based on this information, we can conclude that FNAC is sufficient to diagnose papillary carcinoma of the thyroid (choice A), follicular carcinoma of the thyroid (choice B), and carcinoma breast (choice C). Therefore, the correct answer is D. Adenocarcinoma lung, as FNAC may not be enough to diagnose lung cancers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
