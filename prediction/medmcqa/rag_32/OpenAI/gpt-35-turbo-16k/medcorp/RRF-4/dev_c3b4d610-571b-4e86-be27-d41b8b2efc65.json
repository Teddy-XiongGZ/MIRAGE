    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The loading dose of a drug is determined by several factors, including the desired peak concentration of the drug, the volume of distribution of the drug in the body, the bioavailability, and the fraction of drug salt form which is active drug. Among these factors, the major determinant of the loading dose is the volume of distribution (Vd) of the drug in the body. The loading dose is calculated using the formula: Loading dose = Cp (desired peak concentration) x Vd (volume of distribution) / F (bioavailability). Therefore, the correct answer is C. Volume of distribution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
