    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the relation between the variances of Vitamin D and DBP, we need to compare the variances of the two variables. However, the given information only provides the means and standard deviations of Vitamin D and DBP, not the variances. Therefore, we do not have enough information to determine the relation between the variances of the two variables. Hence, the answer is C. Data insufficient to comment upon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
