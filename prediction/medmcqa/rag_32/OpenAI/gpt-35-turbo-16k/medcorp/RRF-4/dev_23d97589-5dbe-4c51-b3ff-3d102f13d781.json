    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center, we need to calculate the crude birth rate (CBR) per 1,000 population. The CBR is calculated by dividing the number of live births in a year by the mid-year population and multiplying by 1,000. In this case, the CBR is given as 20. However, we do not have the mid-year population data for the sub-center, so we cannot directly calculate the number of pregnant women registered. Therefore, we cannot determine the answer based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
