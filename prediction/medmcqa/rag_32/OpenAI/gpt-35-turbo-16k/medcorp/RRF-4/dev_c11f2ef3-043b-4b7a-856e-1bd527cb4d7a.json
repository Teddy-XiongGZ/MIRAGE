    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with pain in bilateral preauricular region and deviation of the mandible to the right side on mouth opening. This suggests a possible mandibular fracture or dislocation. To determine the specific diagnosis, further evaluation and imaging studies would be necessary. However, based on the given information, the most probable diagnosis would be a fracture of the right condyle (option A) as it can cause pain in the preauricular region and deviation of the mandible to the opposite side of the fracture. Dislocation of both condyles (option D) is less likely as it would typically result in a midline, open, fixed jaw. Dislocation of the left condyle (option C) is also less likely as it would cause deviation of the mandible to the contralateral side. Therefore, the answer choice is A. Fracture of right condyle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
