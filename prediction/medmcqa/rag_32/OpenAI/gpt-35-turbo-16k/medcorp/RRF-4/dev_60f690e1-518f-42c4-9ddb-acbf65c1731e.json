    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel formation starts immediately after the first layer of dentin is laid down by the odontoblasts. The cells from the inner enamel epithelium differentiate into ameloblasts, which secrete the enamel matrix. Once the enamel matrix is laid down, mineralization begins by the secretion of calcium and phosphate ions into the enamel matrix, forming hydroxyapatite crystallites. Therefore, calcification in enamel starts at the enamel matrix.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
