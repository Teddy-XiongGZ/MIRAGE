    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given that the patient has a history of hematemesis and alcoholic liver disease, the most likely cause of the bleeding is variceal bleed. Therefore, the initial management should focus on controlling the bleeding and preventing rebleeding. Somatostatin infusion is indicated as it helps reduce portal pressure and decrease bleeding. A negative nasogastric aspirate does not exclude variceal bleed as the bleeding may be intermittent. Nasogastric tube insertion can provoke variceal bleeding due to the trauma caused by the tube. Upper GI endoscopy is done initially to identify the source of bleeding and guide further management. Therefore, the false statement regarding the patient's management is option D: Upper GI endoscopy is done initially.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
