    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the treatment for a permanent tooth with a fracture involving the apical one-third of the root is not specified. However, it is mentioned that root fractures located in the apical and middle thirds of the root have a good prognosis and usually require little, if any, treatment apart from immediate repositioning and stabilization. Additionally, it is stated that monitoring of root-fractured teeth over time is essential to determine the healing response and to assess whether the pulp survives or not. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the most likely outcome for a permanent tooth with a fracture involving the apical one-third of the root after treatment would be to remain vital and functional.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
