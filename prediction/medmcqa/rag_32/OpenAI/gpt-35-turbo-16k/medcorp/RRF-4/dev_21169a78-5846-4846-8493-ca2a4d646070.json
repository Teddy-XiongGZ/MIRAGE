    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which alloy has the highest coefficient of friction, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss the frictional properties of these alloys. Document [4] discusses the frictional forces between ceramic brackets and archwires of different alloys. It states that the frictional forces were highest with monocrystalline brackets and lowest with nickel-titanium wires. Therefore, the alloy with the highest coefficient of friction is A. SS (stainless steel).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
