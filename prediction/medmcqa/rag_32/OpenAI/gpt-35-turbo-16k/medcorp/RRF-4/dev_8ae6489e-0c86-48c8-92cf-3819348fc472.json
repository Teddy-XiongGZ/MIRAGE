    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information from the relevant documents, the premaxilla is derived from the frontonasal process. Document [0] mentions that in mice, most of the bone covering the face originates from the maxillary prominence, and only a part of the palate originates from the medial nasal prominence. Document [10] confirms that the premaxilla (incisive bone) in therian mammals has dual developmental origins, the lateral body and the palatine process. The palatine process arises in the ventral part of the premandibular domain, where the nasopalatine nerve distributes. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Frontonasal process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
