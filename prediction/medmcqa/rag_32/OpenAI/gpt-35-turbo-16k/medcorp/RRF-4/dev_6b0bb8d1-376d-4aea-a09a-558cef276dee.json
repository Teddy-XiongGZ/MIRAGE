    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about different cardiac markers used in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Document [0] mentions that among many cardiac markers, cardiac troponin I seems to be the most cardiac-specific in the diagnosis of acute MI. Document [1] also states that creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) is the best biochemical marker currently available for the assessment of patients with symptoms of acute MI. Document [2] confirms that cardiac troponins T and I are the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage. Based on this information, the best preferred biochemical marker for MI is cardiac troponin I.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
