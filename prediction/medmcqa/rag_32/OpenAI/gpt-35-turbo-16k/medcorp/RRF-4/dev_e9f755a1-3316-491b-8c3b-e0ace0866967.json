    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient reports sensitivity to chewing pressure 3 weeks after insertion of the distal extension partial denture. To determine the most probable reason, we need to consider the potential causes of sensitivity in this scenario. Improper occlusion could cause sensitivity, but it is less likely to occur 3 weeks after insertion. Abrasion of the tooth by the clasp could also cause sensitivity, but it would typically take longer than 3 weeks for this to occur. Wearing off the cement base is not a common cause of sensitivity. The most probable reason for sensitivity to chewing pressure 3 weeks after insertion of the distal extension partial denture is a passive retentive arm. If the retentive arm is not providing enough retention, it can cause the denture to move during chewing, leading to sensitivity. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Passive retentive arm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
