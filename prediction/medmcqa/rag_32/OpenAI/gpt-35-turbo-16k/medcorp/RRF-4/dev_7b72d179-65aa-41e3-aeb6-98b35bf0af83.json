    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The donor developed paresthesias, circumoral numbness, and tachycardia during platelet apheresis. These symptoms, along with ST-T changes on ECG, suggest the possibility of hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can occur during apheresis due to the anticoagulant citrate binding to calcium in the blood, leading to a decrease in ionized calcium levels. This can cause symptoms such as paresthesias, numbness, and tachycardia. The donor's vitals remaining stable suggests that hypovolemic shock is unlikely. Seizures and allergic reactions are not consistent with the symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
