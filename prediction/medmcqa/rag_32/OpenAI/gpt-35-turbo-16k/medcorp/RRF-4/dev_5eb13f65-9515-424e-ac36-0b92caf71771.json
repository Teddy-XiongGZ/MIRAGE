    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the SCC is present on the lateral margin of the tongue and the staging is T2N0. The treatment options for SCC of the tongue depend on various factors such as tumor size, depth of invasion, and presence of lymph node metastasis. In this case, since the staging is T2N0, there is no evidence of lymph node involvement. Therefore, the appropriate treatment option would be to remove lymph node I-II along with the primary tumor. This is a selective neck dissection that involves removing lymph nodes in levels I and II of the neck. This approach is recommended for early-stage tongue SCC without lymph node metastasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
