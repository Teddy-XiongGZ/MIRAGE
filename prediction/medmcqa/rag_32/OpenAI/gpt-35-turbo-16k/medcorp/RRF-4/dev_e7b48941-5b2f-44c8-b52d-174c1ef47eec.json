    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-working contact refers to the contact between teeth or dental prostheses that occurs during non-functional movements, such as swallowing or resting. It is important to have non-working contacts to provide stability and balance to the occlusion. Non-working contacts are needed in natural dentition to ensure proper occlusal function. They are also needed in complete dentures to provide stability and prevent tipping of the denture base. However, non-working contacts are not necessary in distal extension removable partial dentures (RPDs) because these RPDs rely on support from the remaining natural teeth and the underlying tissues for stability and retention. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
