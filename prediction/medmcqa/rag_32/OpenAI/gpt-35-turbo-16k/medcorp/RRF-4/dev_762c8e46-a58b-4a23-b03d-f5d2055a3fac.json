    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A lateral sliding flap is a surgical technique used to cover denuded roots. The goal of this procedure is to achieve root coverage by repositioning the flap over the denuded root surface. In the case of a lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years, it is expected that the flap will cover the previously denuded root surface. The lateral sliding flap technique involves the repositioning of the flap to cover the root surface, which can result in the attachment of periodontal ligament (PDL) fibers to the cementum of the root. Therefore, the most likely outcome of a lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years is that PDL fibers will be attached to the cementum of the root.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
