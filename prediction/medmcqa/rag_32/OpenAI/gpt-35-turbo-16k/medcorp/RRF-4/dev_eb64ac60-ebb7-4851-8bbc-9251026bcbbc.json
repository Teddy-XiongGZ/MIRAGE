    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process that is characterized by specific morphological and biochemical changes. To determine which statement is false about apoptosis, we need to review the characteristics of apoptosis mentioned in the documents. The documents mention that apoptosis is a highly regulated process and is accompanied by specific morphological changes such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, apoptosis is known to be mediated by dedicated genes and does not involve inflammation. However, the documents do not specifically mention whether the plasma membrane remains intact or whether organelle swelling occurs during apoptosis. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine which statement is false without further information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
