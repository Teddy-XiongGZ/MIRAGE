    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cement has the best modulus of elasticity for supporting complex amalgam restoration, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the modulus of elasticity of a base is more important than compressive strength in supporting an amalgam restoration. Document [2] mentions that the modulus of elasticity of composites most likely to be used in posterior teeth is approximately one third of the modulus of elasticity of amalgam. Document [3] states that the maximum tensile stresses and deflections in an amalgam restoration increased with a zinc oxide-eugenol base compared to a zinc phosphate cement base. Document [19] mentions that the deflections in a composite restoration were highest when it was supported by a base with a low modulus. Based on this information, we can conclude that the cement with the best modulus of elasticity for supporting complex amalgam restoration is Zinc phosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
