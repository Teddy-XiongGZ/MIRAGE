    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the sequential arrangement of fetal scans. To determine the correct answer, we need to review the relevant documents and find information about the sequential arrangement of scans. Document [2] discusses the sequential segmental approach to fetal congenital heart disease, while Document [7] describes a sequential sector scan through the oral fissure for fetal palate screening. However, neither of these documents specifically mention the scans mentioned in the answer choices (growth scan, triple marker, anomalous scan, and NT scan). Therefore, based on the provided documents, we cannot definitively determine the correct answer. It is possible that the correct answer is not mentioned in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
