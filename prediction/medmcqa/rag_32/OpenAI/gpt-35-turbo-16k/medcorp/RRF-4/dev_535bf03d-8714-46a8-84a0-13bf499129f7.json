    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following does not require 5' capping, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that the 5' modification indistinguishable from the cap on full-length mRNA is present in beta-globin mRNA and capping enzymes are found in the cytoplasm of cells. Document [1] discusses the capping signals in different small RNAs, including U6 snRNA. Document [3] states that poliovirus messenger RNA is not capped at its 5' end. Based on this information, we can conclude that tRNA of alanine, mRNA for histone, and U6 snRNA all require 5' capping. Therefore, the answer is D. siRNA, as it does not require 5' capping.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
