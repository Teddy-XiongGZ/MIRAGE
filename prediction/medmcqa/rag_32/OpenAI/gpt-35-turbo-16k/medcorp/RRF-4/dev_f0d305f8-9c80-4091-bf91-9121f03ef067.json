    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which bacteria of the oral flora plays the least role in periodontitis, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that periodontopathic bacteria such as Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema socranskii were detected in the salivary samples from patients with periodontitis. Document [2] mentions that the most remarkable change in the bacterial plaque during periodontal disease is the shift from gram-positive aerobic and facultatively anaerobic flora to a predominantly gram-negative and anaerobic flora. Document [4] states that Streptococcus mutans and anaerobic lactobacilli are common in dental caries, Actinomyces and Peptostreptococcus spp. in gingivitis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis in periodontitis. Based on this information, we can conclude that the bacteria Actinomyces plays the least role in periodontitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
