    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin and glucagon have opposing effects on blood glucose levels. Insulin promotes glycogen synthesis, inhibits glycogen breakdown, inhibits gluconeogenesis, and inhibits ketogenesis. Glucagon, on the other hand, promotes glycogen breakdown, promotes gluconeogenesis, and promotes ketogenesis. Therefore, low insulin to glucagon ratio would be associated with increased glycogen breakdown, increased gluconeogenesis, and increased ketogenesis. So, the correct answer is D. Ketogenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
