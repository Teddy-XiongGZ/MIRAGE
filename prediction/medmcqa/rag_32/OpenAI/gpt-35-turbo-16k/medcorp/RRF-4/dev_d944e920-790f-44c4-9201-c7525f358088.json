    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chylomicrons are formed in the small intestine, specifically in the absorptive cells called enterocytes. The relevant documents mention that chylomicrons are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum of enterocytes and are then secreted into the lacteals, which are part of the lymphatic vessels originating in the villi of the small intestine.
