    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To check objective pain response, we need to look for a method that objectively measures pain. From the provided documents, we can see that there are various methods and tools mentioned for pain assessment, such as self-rating pain scales, devices and techniques that administer a pain stimulus, laboratory techniques to measure reaction to experimental pain, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) combined with machine learning. However, none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) directly correspond to these methods. Therefore, based on the given options, it is not possible to determine the best method for checking objective pain response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
