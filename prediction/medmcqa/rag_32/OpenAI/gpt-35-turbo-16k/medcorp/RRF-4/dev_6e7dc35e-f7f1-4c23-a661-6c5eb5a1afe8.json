    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, we can find information about the characteristics and performance of stainless-steel (S/S) and nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) spreaders. We need to find the statement that is not true for S/S spreader compared to Ni-Ti spreader. Document [0] compares the penetration of accessory gutta-percha cones using Ni-Ti and S/S spreaders in curved canals. It states that Ni-Ti spreaders and #15 accessory cones penetrated deeper in curved canals than S/S spreaders and #15 accessory cones. This suggests that Ni-Ti spreaders achieve greater depth penetration than S/S spreaders. Document [4] compares the physical properties of finger spreaders made of S/S and Ni-Ti alloys. It mentions that Ni-Ti spreaders are more flexible than S/S spreaders. This indicates that Ni-Ti spreaders have more flexibility compared to S/S spreaders. Document [5] also compares the penetration of spreaders in curved canals. It states that Ni-Ti spreaders penetrated significantly deeper than S/S spreaders. This further supports the idea that Ni-Ti spreaders achieve greater depth penetration than S/S spreaders. Based on the information from these documents, we can conclude that statement A is not true. The correct statement is that less depth penetration is achieved with S/S spreader compared to Ni-Ti spreader. Therefore, the answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
