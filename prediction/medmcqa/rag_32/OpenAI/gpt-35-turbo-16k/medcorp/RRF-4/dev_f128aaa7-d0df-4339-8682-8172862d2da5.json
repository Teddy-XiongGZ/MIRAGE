    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-immune hydrops is characterized by excessive accumulation of fluid in the extravascular spaces. The question asks which of the following is NOT seen in non-immune hydrops. To answer this, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that non-immune hydrops is diagnosed when there is fluid accumulation in more than one extravascular space. Document [4] mentions that hydrops fetalis, which includes non-immune hydrops, is characterized by an excessive accumulation of fetal fluid. Document [13] explains that non-immune hydrops can lead to left-sided heart failure, resulting in pulmonary edema, and right-sided heart failure, leading to peripheral edema and ascites. Document [18] states that non-immune hydrops fetalis is associated with generalized edema, ascites, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion(s), and an abnormally thick placenta. Based on this information, skin edema (skin oedema) is a characteristic feature of non-immune hydrops. Ascites, large placenta, and cardiomegaly are also commonly seen in non-immune hydrops. Therefore, the answer is not A. Skin oedema.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
