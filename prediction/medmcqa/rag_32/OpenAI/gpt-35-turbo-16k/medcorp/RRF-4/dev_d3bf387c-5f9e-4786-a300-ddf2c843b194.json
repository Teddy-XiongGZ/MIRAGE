    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine where the temporo-mandibular ligament is attached, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that the temporo-mandibular ligament is actually the thickened lateral portion of the capsule, and it has two parts: an outer oblique portion (OOP) and an inner horizontal portion (IHP).
