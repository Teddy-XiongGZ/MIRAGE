    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the treatment of high velocity gunshot injuries with periosteal denudation and comminuted fracture involves immediate debridement, followed by load bearing reconstruction plates and grafting in a secondary procedure. This is supported by the documents that mention the need for debridement and appropriate fracture stabilization in high-energy gunshot injuries. Reconstruction plates and closure of the fracture (option B) may not provide sufficient stability for comminuted fractures, and immediate reconstruction and grafting (option C) may not be feasible due to the need for debridement and assessment of tissue viability. 'Bag of bones' and intermaxillary fixation (option A) is not mentioned as a treatment option for high velocity gunshot injuries. Therefore, the best answer choice is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
