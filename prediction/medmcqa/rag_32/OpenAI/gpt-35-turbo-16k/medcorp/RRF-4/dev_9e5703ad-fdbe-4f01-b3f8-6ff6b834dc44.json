    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following has strong familial inheritance, we need to analyze the relevant documents for information about familial inheritance. Document [1] mentions that familial aggregation is the practice of combining multiple data sets of different traits and/or characteristics in a family to measure the extent of familial aggregation for a trait. Document [4] discusses familial resemblance, which arises when family members are more similar than unrelated pairs of individuals, and can be estimated in terms of correlations or covariances among family members. Document [5] states that almost all human diseases have been shown to aggregate familially to some degree, suggesting the existence of a genetic etiologic mechanism or common environmental factors among family members. Based on this information, it is likely that the trait with strong familial inheritance is mentioned in the context of familial aggregation or familial resemblance. Let's analyze the potential choices based on this information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Class II div I\"}"
