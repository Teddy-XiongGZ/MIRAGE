    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, the cleaning of blood on the OT floor is typically done using chlorine-based compounds. Document [2] mentions that OTs were properly cleaned with soap and water, followed by disinfection with fumigation using quaternary ammonium compounds. However, document [7] states that routine floor disinfection without disinfectant did not show a significant difference in infection rate.
