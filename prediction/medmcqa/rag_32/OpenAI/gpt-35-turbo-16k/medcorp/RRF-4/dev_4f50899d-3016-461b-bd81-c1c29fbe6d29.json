Document [3] states that psychiatrists are medical doctors who evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental ailments, or strictly mental issues. It also mentions that psychiatrists sometimes work within a multi-disciplinary team, which may include clinical psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and nursing staff.
