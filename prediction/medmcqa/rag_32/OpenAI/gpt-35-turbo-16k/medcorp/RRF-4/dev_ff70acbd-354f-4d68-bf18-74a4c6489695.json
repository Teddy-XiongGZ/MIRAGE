    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the base deficit, we need to use the formula: Base Deficit = 0.93 x (12 - HCO3-) x weight (kg). Plugging in the values, we get: Base Deficit = 0.93 x (12 - 6) x 75 = 0.93 x 6 x 75 = 418.5 mEq. Therefore, the base deficit is approximately 418.5 mEq.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
