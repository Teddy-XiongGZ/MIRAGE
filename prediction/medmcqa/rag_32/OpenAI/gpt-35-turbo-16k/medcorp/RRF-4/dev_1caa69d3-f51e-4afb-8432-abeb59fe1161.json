    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypertonic solution is used in various medical conditions. To determine which condition it is not used in, we need to review the information provided in the documents. Document [2] mentions that hypertonic saline is used in critical care settings, acutely increased intracranial pressure, or severe hyponatremia. Document [8] states that hypertonic saline is used for increased intracranial pressure. Document [13] mentions that hypertonic saline is used in treating hyponatremia and cerebral edema. Document [15] states that hypertonic saline is used for reducing intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injuries. Document [21] mentions the use of hypertonic saline in the resuscitation of severely shocked patients. Based on this information, it can be concluded that hypertonic solution is used in all of the given conditions (prolonged bowel surgery, cardiac type IV shock, brain injury, and burn). Therefore, the answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
