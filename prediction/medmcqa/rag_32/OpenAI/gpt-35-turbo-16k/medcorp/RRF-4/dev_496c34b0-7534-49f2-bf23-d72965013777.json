    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the blade-/plate-form implant has been shown to be successful under three different types of integration: fibrous integration, fibro-osseous integration, and osseous integration. Fibrous integration occurs when the layer of fibrous or collagenous tissue between the implant and bone is less than 125 microns. Fibro-osseous integration is a combination of thinly defined fibrous connection with 22% or less direct bone contact with the implant. Osseous integration is characterized by 23% or more direct bone-to-implant contact, with no evidence of fibrous connective tissue anywhere. Therefore, the integration between blade vent implant and bone is most likely Osseo-integration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
