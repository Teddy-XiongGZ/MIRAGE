    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Erythroblastosis fetalis is caused by the destruction of neonatal red blood cells by maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. These antibodies form when fetal erythrocytes expressing certain red blood cell antigens that are not expressed in the mother cross the placenta and gain access to maternal blood. Therefore, the antibodies involved in erythroblastosis fetalis are specific to the antigens present on fetal red blood cells. From the given options, Anti C, Anti D, and Anti E are all antibodies that can be involved in erythroblastosis fetalis. However, Anti Lewis is not typically associated with erythroblastosis fetalis. Therefore, the answer is D. Anti Lewis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
