    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tooth has a buccal surface made of 2 lobes, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the mandibular second premolar most commonly has three cusps but can have two as well. The three cusp variety has one large cusp on the buccal with two smaller lingual cusps. This indicates that the mandibular second premolar can have a buccal surface made of 2 lobes. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Lower 1st molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
