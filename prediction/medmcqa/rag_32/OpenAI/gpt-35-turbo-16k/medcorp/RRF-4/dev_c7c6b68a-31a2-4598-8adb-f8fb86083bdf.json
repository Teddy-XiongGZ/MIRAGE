    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about metformin, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. According to the documents, metformin is a medication used to lower blood sugar in those with type 2 diabetes. It is the most widely used medication for diabetes taken by mouth. Metformin works by reducing hepatic glucose production, which helps to lower blood sugar levels. It is excreted unchanged in urine and does not undergo significant metabolism in the liver.

Therefore, the statement 'Inhibits cellular respiration in mitochondria' is not true about metformin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
