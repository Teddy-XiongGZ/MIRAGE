    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, several studies have investigated the use of the dental operating microscope (DOM) in locating the MB2 canal in maxillary first molars. The studies have reported varying percentages of success in locating the MB2 canal using the DOM. To determine the answer to the question, we need to review the relevant information from the documents. Document [3] states that the sensitivity and accuracy of the DOM group in locating the MB2 canal were 0.78 and 0.76, respectively, which were higher than the naked eye group. Document [5] reports that the use of a DOM significantly improved the identification of the MB2 canal in maxillary first molars. Document [14] mentions that the use of magnification, such as the DOM or dental loupes, led to a higher detection rate of the MB2 canal compared to no magnification. Document [19] states that the prevalence of the MB2 canal in maxillary first molars was 64.76% using CBCT imaging. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the use of the DOM can improve the detection rate of the MB2 canal in maxillary first molars. However, the exact percentage of cases in which the MB2 canal can be seen through the DOM is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined definitively from the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
