    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Interruption of the optic chiasm will lead to a specific visual field defect known as bitemporal hemianopia. This is because the optic chiasm is the site where the nasal fibers from each eye cross over to the opposite side, resulting in the fusion of the temporal visual fields from both eyes. Therefore, interruption of the optic chiasm will result in loss of the temporal visual fields, leading to bitemporal hemianopia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Bitemporal hemianopia\"}"
