To answer this, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the burden of non-communicable diseases in developing countries has increased. Document [3] predicts that by 2020, non-communicable diseases will cause seven out of every ten deaths in developing countries. Document [6] mentions that the fastest-growing causes of disease burden over the last 26 years were diabetes and ischemic heart disease.

This trend is referred to as a secular trend, which is a long-term trend that occurs over decades or centuries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Secular\"}"
