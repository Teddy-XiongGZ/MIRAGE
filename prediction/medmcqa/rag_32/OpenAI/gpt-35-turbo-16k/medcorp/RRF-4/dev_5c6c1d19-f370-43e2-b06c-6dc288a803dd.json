    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the minimum incidence of cleft palate, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the prevalence rate for cleft palate alone (CP) is 5.5 to 6.6 per 10,000 births in the U.S. Document [4] mentions that the prevalence rate of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL +/- P) in Jordan is 1.39 per 1,000 live births. Document [6] provides prevalence rates for CL +/- P per 10,000 live births in Hawaii, with rates ranging from 10 in Caucasians to 16 in people of Far East Asian descent. Document [12] reports an overall prevalence rate of 1.39 per 1,000 live births for CL +/- P in Jordan. Document [19] mentions that the prevalence rate of cleft lip and palate in the Chinese population ranges from 1.33 to 2.23 per 1,000 live and stillbirths. Based on this information, we can conclude that the minimum incidence of cleft palate is seen in South Americans, as there is no specific mention of prevalence rates for cleft palate in South America in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
