    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cell junctions are present in the structure marked with the arrow, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [2] mentions that the junctional complex consists of three types of junctions: occluding junctions (also known as tight junctions), adherens junctions, and macula adherens (also known as desmosomes). Document [5] also mentions that the tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes are part of the junctional complex. However, there is no mention of gap junctions in relation to the junctional complex. Therefore, the structure marked with the arrow does not have gap junctions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
