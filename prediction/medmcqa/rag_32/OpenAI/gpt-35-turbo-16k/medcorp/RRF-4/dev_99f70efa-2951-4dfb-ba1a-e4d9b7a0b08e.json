    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is true about Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the scheme provides for cashless insurance for hospitalization in public as well as private hospitals. This indicates that statement A is true. None of the documents mention that the scheme is valid for up to 4 family members, so statement B cannot be confirmed. Document [0] mentions that the scheme has been implemented in 25 states of India, indicating that it is not limited to only 1 district, so statement C is false. Document [2] states that the scheme provides insurance coverage for secondary care, but it does not specify that treatment is limited to government hospitals, so statement D cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Cashless benefit on presenting smacard and fingerprints.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
