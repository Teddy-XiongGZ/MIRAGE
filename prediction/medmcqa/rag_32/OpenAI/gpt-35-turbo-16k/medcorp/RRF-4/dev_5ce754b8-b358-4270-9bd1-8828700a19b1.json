    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the appropriate blade angle for scaling and root planing, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] mentions that Gracey curettes have angulated working blades that are area specific and are best for subgingival scaling and root planing because of the offset blade allowing for greater adaptation. Document [11] provides information about different types of periodontal curettes, including Gracey curettes, which have a stronger, rigid shank and angulated working blades. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the appropriate blade angle for scaling and root planing is an angulated blade. Therefore, the correct answer is B. B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
