    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Methylation and acetylation are epigenetic modifications that can change gene expression without altering the content of the gene. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene function that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence, and it includes DNA methylation and histone modification, both of which can affect gene expression. Translocation, inversion, and transduction are genetic mechanisms that involve changes in the DNA sequence and are not directly related to methylation and acetylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
