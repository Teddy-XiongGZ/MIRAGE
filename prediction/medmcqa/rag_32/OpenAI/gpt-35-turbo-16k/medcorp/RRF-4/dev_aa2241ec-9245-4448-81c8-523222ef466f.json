    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the statements about cast cobalt alloys and determine which one is false. Let's go through each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. They have a modulus of elasticity twice that of gold alloys. This statement is true. Cobalt alloys have a higher modulus of elasticity compared to gold alloys.\\n\\nB. They are more rigid than gold alloys. This statement is true. Cobalt alloys are generally more rigid than gold alloys.\\n\\nC. They have higher ductility than gold alloys. This statement is true. Cobalt alloys have higher ductility compared to gold alloys.\\n\\nD. They have a lower proportional limit than gold alloys. This statement is false. Cobalt alloys have a higher proportional limit compared to gold alloys. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
