    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rh isoimmunisation is a condition where a person's immune system produces antibodies against the Rh antigens on red blood cells. The question asks which type of Hb is not affected by Rh isoimmunisation. To answer this, we need to determine which type of Hb is not associated with the Rh antigens. From the provided documents, we can see that the Rh antigens are classified as D, C, E, and e. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Anti D antibodies are produced in response to the D antigen, which is part of the Rh system. Anti C, Anti E, and Anti lewis antibodies are not directly related to the Rh system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
