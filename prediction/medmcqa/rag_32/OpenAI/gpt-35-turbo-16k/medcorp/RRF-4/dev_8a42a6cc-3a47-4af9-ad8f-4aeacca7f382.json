    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are classified based on their action on substrates, which means the chemical reaction they catalyze. This is mentioned in Document [1] which states that an enzyme's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes. Additionally, Document [3] provides the top-level classification of enzymes, where each enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations that represent the reaction catalyzed. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Action on substrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
