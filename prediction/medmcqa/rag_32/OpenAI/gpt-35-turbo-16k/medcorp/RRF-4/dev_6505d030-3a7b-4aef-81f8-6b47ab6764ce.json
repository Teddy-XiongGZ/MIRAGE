    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the cleaning methods for the tip of an ultrasonic scaler after usage are not explicitly mentioned. However, Document [0] mentions that sharpening ultrasonic scalers can be carried out, paying attention not to damage the water cooling system. Document [6] mentions that ultrasonic scalers include a liquid output or lavage, which aids in cooling the tool during use, as well as rinsing all the unwanted materials from the teeth and gum line. Document [16] states that coolant liquid must be used with an ultrasonic scaler because of heat buildup in the ultrasonic handpiece and scaler tip. Considering this information, it is likely that the tip of an ultrasonic scaler is cleaned by running water (H2O) to remove any debris or residue. Therefore, the answer choice is A. Under running H2O for 2 min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
