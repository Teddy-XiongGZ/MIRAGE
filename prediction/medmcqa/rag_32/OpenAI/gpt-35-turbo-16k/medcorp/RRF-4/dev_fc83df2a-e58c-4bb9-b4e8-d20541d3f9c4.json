    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the minimum sample size required for the study, we can use the formula n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2, where n is the sample size, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 95% confidence corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96), p is the estimated prevalence of the disease (50% in this case), and E is the desired margin of error (5% in this case). Plugging in the values, we get n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1-0.5)) / 0.05^2 = 384.16. Since the sample size must be an integer and must lie on or above the calculated minimum, the minimum sample size required for the study is 400.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
