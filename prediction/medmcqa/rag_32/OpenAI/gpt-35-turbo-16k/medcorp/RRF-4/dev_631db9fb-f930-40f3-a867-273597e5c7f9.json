    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pre-carve burnishing is a technique used in the finishing of amalgam restorations. It involves using a burnisher to polish and contour the amalgam filling before the final carving. Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the effects of pre-carve burnishing. The documents mention that burnishing can improve the carving characteristics of the amalgam and result in a smoother surface. It can also help in achieving better marginal integrity and decrease the number and size of voids. However, there is no mention of pre-carve burnishing bringing further excess mercury to the surface or increasing surface hardness. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
