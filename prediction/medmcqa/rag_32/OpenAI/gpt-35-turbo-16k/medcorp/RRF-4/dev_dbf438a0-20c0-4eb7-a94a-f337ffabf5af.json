    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about H. influenza, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that H. influenzae survives when placed separately into a nasal cavity, indicating that it can survive on its own. Document [20] states that H. influenzae is responsible for a wide range of localized and invasive infections, but influenza is caused by viruses, not bacteria. Therefore, the statement 'Most common invasive disease of H. influenza is meningitis' is not true, as H. influenzae can cause other invasive diseases as well. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
