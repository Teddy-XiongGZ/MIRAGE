    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the nature of the inter radicular bone, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the inter-radicular distance and the thickness of the cortical bone were measured using computed tomography (CT) imaging. It mentions that the inter-radicular distance suggests a minimal risk of radicular injury when miniscrews are inserted between the alveolar structures. Document [7] discusses the width and nature of inter-radicular spaces in human teeth. It mentions that cancellous bone flanked by lamina dura was found between the teeth examined. Based on these documents, it can be concluded that the inter-radicular bone is cancellous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
