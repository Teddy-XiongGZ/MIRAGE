    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gluconeogenesis is a pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis are responsible for converting non-carbohydrate sources, such as lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids, into glucose. The enzymes that play a role in gluconeogenesis include pyruvate carboxylase, PEP carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase. Pyruvate kinase, on the other hand, is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, not gluconeogenesis. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Pyruvate kinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
