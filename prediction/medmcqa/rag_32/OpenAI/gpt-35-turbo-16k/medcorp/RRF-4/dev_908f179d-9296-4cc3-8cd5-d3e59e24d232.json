    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that discusses the use of finger springs in orthodontic appliances is Document [5]. According to this document, finger springs are often used to tip teeth in a mesiodistal direction. However, it does not specifically mention the undesirable side effects associated with finger springs. To find the answer, we can look at other relevant documents that discuss orthodontic mechanics and tooth movement. Document [23] discusses the optimization of anterior and canine retraction, which involves the use of springs. It mentions that the design and selection of a proper retraction spring should be based on scientific criteria, including a sufficiently high moment-to-force ratio to prevent displacement of the root apex. This suggests that the undesirable side effect most commonly associated with the use of finger springs to tip the crown of a tooth is the tendency for the root apex to move in the direction opposite from the crown. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Tendency for the root apex to move in the direction opposite from the crown.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
