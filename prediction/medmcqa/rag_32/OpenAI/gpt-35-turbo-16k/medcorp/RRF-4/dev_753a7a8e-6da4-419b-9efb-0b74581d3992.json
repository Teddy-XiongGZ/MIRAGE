    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the patient with Tubercular meningitis has experienced a deterioration in sensorium despite regular intake of anti-tubercular drugs. The priority in this situation is to assess the patient's condition and determine the cause of the deterioration. The most important investigation in this emergency condition would be a CT scan of the brain (NCCT) to evaluate for any acute changes such as hydrocephalus or intracranial hemorrhage. MRI may also be helpful in assessing the extent of the disease, but it is not required as an emergency investigation. CSF examination is important to evaluate for any changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, such as increased cell count or decreased glucose levels, which may indicate worsening of the infection. Liver function tests may be useful to assess the patient's liver function, but they are not necessary as an emergency investigation in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
