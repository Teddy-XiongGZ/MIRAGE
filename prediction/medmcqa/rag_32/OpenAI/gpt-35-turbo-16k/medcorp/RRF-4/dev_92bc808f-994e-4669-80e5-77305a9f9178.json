    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention that catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, are involved in increasing blood pressure by activating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle. Therefore, the hormone that enhances the tone of vascular smooth muscle and assists in elevating blood pressure is likely to be a hormone that works in conjunction with catecholamines. Among the given choices, cortisol is the hormone that is known to have a synergistic effect with catecholamines in increasing blood pressure. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to stress, and it has been shown to enhance the vasoconstrictor effects of catecholamines. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Cortisol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
