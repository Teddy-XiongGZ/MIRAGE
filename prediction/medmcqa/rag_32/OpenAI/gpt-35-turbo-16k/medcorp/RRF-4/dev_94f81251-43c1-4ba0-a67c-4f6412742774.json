    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The speed with which the electrons travel from the filament of the cathode to the anode depends on the potential difference between the two electrodes. The potential difference, also known as the voltage applied across the cathode and anode, accelerates the electrons towards the anode. The higher the voltage, the faster the electrons will travel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
