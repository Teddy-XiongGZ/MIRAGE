    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In centric occlusion, complete denture teeth should not be in edge to edge contact. The goal is to achieve bilateral balanced occlusion, where there are simultaneous contacts in both centric and eccentric positions. To achieve this, the cusps of the upper and lower teeth should be ground in a specific way. The incline of the upper cusp should slide buccally, while the incline of the lower cusp should slide lingually. This allows for proper occlusal function and stability. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Grind the cusp in such a way that the incline of the upper cusp slides buccally and lower cusp slides lingually.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
