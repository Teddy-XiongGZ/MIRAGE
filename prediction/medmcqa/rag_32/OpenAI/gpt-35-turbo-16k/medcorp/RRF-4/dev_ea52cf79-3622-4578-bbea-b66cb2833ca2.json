    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant documents, we can find information about the development of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in humans. Document [12] states that the TMJ eminence reaches more than 50% of its mature size by the time of completion of eruption of the primary dentition, which typically occurs around 5-6 years of age. Document [22] mentions that at birth, after 150 days gestation, the marmoset TMJ resembles the human joint at the end of the second trimester, suggesting that TMJ development in humans may occur around the end of the second trimester, which is approximately 26-29 weeks of gestation. Therefore, based on this information, the answer choice would be D. 29 weeks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
