    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which structures form Waldeyer's lymphatic chain, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] describes the structure of Waldeyer's tonsillar ring, which consists of the pharyngeal tonsil (or adenoid), tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils, and lingual tonsils.
