    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which device works on the traction principle, we need to understand what traction is. Traction is the force used to generate motion between a body and a tangential surface through the use of dry friction or shear force. It is the force that makes an object move over a surface by overcoming resisting forces like friction, normal loads, air resistance, and rolling resistance. From the given options, we need to identify the device that does not work on the traction principle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
