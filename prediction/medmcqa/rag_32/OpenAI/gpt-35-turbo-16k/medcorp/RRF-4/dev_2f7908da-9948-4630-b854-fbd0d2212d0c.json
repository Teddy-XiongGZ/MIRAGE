    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the advantage of chromic gut over plain gut suture in deep wounds, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] compares histologic and mechanical properties of chromic gut and glycerin-treated chromic gut. Document [2] discusses the strength retention of chromic gut and synthetic absorbable sutures in a nonhealing synovial wound. Document [7] provides considerations in the choice of sutures for wound closure of the genitourinary tract. Document [27] presents a prospective clinical trial examining the benefits of using an absorbable suture for the closure of scalp wounds. Document [30] provides information on catgut suture, including chromic gut. Based on this information, we can conclude that the advantage of chromic gut over plain gut suture in deep wounds is D. Less tissue irritation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
