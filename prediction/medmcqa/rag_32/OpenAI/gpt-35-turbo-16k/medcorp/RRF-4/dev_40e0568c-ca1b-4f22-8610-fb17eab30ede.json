    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best incision preferred for diaphragmatic surgery is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, Document [9] states that a midline incision or a wide transverse incision offers good access to the abdominal cavity, and a midline incision should probably be preferred to avoid severing major nerves, muscles, or vessels. Document [14] also mentions that diaphragmatic eventration can be repaired by video-assisted thoracoscopy, which suggests that a thoracoscopic approach with small incisions may be an option. Based on this information, it can be inferred that a transverse incision is a possible choice for diaphragmatic surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Transverse\"}"
