    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Working side interference refers to interference that occurs on the side of the mouth where chewing or grinding is happening. To remove working side interference, we need to identify the cusps that are causing the interference and adjust or remove them. The potential choices given are guiding cusps and supporting cusps.
