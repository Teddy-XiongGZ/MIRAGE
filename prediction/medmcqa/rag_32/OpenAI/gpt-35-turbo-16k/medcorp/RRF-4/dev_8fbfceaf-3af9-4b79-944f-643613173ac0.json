However, it does not specifically mention infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M.

Document [10] investigates the risk of neonatal septicaemia after prolonged rupture of the membranes, but it does not focus on infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [11] discusses the long-term morbidity in infants of diabetic mothers, which is relevant to the question. However, it does not specify the complications associated with I.D.D.M. Document [12] examines the mortality of very low birth weight infants at birth, but it does not provide information about infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M.

Document [15] discusses the \"long-term morbidity\" computer program in perinatology, but it does not provide information about infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [16] examines the increasing rate of caesarean section and its clinical study, but it does not focus on infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [17] explores the catch-up growth of infants born to mothers with autoimmune rheumatic disorders, but it does not specifically mention infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [18] is not relevant to the question. Document [19] discusses the long-term health-related and economic consequences of short-term outcomes in the evaluation of perinatal interventions, but it does not provide information about infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [20] investigates the risk of neonatal septicaemia after prolonged rupture of the membranes in Nigeria, but it does not focus on infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [21] provides information about infant health in Texas, but it does not specifically mention infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [22] examines the morbidity and outcome of low birthweight babies of adolescent mothers, but it does not provide information about infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [23] discusses changing definitions of long-term follow-up, but it does not provide information about infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [24] investigates the complications of using silastic catheters in newborns, but it does not focus on infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [25] explores the emotional states of mothers and characteristics of early interaction with their prematurely born babies, but it does not specifically mention infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [26] examines out-of-hospital deliveries in Mexico, but it does not focus on infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [27] investigates the morbidity and outcome of delayed-interval delivery in multi-fetal pregnancies, but it does not provide information about infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M.

Document [30] investigates the association between maternal fatness and the viability of preterm infants, but it does not specifically mention infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Document [31] examines the association between delivering an SGA newborn and long-term maternal cardiovascular morbidity, but it does not provide information about infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Based on the available documents, there is no specific information about the long-term complications of infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M. Therefore, the answer choice is unknown.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unknown\"}"
