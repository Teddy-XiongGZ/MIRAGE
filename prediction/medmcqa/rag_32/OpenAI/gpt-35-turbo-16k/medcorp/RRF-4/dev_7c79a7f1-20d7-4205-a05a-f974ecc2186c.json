    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The term 'centric holding cusp' refers to the cusp that plays a role in maintaining the stability of the occlusion in centric relation. To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the concept of centric relation and the cusps involved in it. Centric relation is the occlusal position of the mandible in which the cusps of the teeth of both arches fully interpose themselves with the cusps of the teeth of the opposing arch. According to the relevant documents, the maxillary palatal cusps and the mandibular facial cusps are involved in centric occlusion. Therefore, the correct answer should be the cusp that is part of the maxillary palatal cusps. Let's examine the options: \\n\\nA. Mesiobuccal cusp of maxillary 1st molar: This is not part of the maxillary palatal cusps.\\nB. Mesiolingual cusp of mandibular first molar: This is not part of the maxillary palatal cusps.\\nC. Distolingual cusp of mandibular 1st molar: This is not part of the maxillary palatal cusps.\\nD. Mesiopalatal cusp of maxillary 1st molar: This is part of the maxillary palatal cusps. \\n\\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is D. Mesiopalatal cusp of maxillary 1st molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
