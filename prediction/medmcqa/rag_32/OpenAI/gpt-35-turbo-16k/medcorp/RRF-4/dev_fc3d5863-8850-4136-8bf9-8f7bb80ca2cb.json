    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the statements is not true, we need to review the information provided in the documents. Document [0] states that rifabutin at 150 mg/d showed the best risk-to-benefit ratio, with the highest proportion of patients completing treatment, highest bacteriological conversion rates, and lowest incidence of adverse events. Document [1] mentions that rifabutin has at least equivalent activity/efficacy and acceptable tolerance compared with rifampicin in TB and non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases. Document [3] states that rifabutin is recommended as first-line treatment for tuberculosis and is used in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex disease. Document [7] highlights the advantages of rifabutin in its pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile, particularly in HIV co-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy. Based on this information, we can conclude that statement C is not true, as rifabutin is not more efficacious against MAC compared to rifampicin. Therefore, the answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
