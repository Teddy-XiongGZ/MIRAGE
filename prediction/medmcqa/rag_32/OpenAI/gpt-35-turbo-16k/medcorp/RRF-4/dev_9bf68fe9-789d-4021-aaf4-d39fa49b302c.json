    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Niacin and riboflavin are involved in various metabolic processes in the body. Riboflavin is essential for the formation of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are involved in energy metabolism, cellular respiration, and antibody production. Niacin, on the other hand, is a component of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are involved in multiple metabolic processes, including fat synthesis, intracellular respiratory metabolism, and glycolysis. Based on this information, niacin and riboflavin are most likely involved in redox reactions, which are oxidation-reduction reactions that play a crucial role in energy production and metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
