    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which nucleus has cardio inhibitory function, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [1] discusses a cardio-inhibitory mechanism in the gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the medulla oblongata. Document [3] mentions that the nucleus ambiguus is involved in parasympathetic output and inhibits the heart rate. Document [7] states that the nucleus ambiguus inhibits activity of cardiovascular units in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Document [8] discusses the role of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in vasomotor control. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the nucleus ambiguus has cardio inhibitory function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
