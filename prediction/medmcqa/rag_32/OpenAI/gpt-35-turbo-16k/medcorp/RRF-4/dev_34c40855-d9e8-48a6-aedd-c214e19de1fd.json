    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, each finger is provided with two interossei (palmar or dorsal), with the exception of the little finger, in which the abductor digiti minimi muscle takes the place of one of the dorsal interossei. Therefore, the finger with two dorsal interossei attached is not the little finger. The remaining options are the index, middle, and ring fingers. Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated which of these fingers have two dorsal interossei attached. However, Document [2] mentions that the second and third dorsal interossei insert into the lateral and medial sides, respectively, of the middle finger. Therefore, the finger with two dorsal interossei attached is likely the middle finger.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Middle\"}"
