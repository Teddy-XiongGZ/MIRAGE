    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the cells that proliferate from top to bottom of villi are enterocytes (absorptive cells). This is supported by Document [0] which states that enterocytes in their mitotic period were observed along the entire length of the intestinal crypt of the caecum, with a denser distribution in the middle portion of the crypt. Document [1] also mentions that enterocytes migrate up along the villi to the surface of the intestinal lumen. None of the other cell types mentioned in the potential choices (chief cells, goblet cells, Paneth cells, parietal cells) are specifically mentioned to proliferate from top to bottom of villi.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
