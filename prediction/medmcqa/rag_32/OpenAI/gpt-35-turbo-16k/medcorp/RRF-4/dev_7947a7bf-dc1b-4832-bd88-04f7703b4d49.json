    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dystrophic calcification is the deposition of calcium salts in degenerated or necrotic tissue. It occurs as a result of tissue damage, including trauma, infection, inflammation, and neoplasia. Based on the provided documents, there is no specific mention of dystrophic calcification occurring in enamel, pulp, or periodontal ligament. However, there are references to dystrophic calcification occurring in soft tissues, such as the floor of the mouth, masseter muscle, and skin. Dentin is a component of teeth and is considered a hard tissue. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is most likely that dystrophic calcification is seen in soft tissues rather than oral tissues like enamel, pulp, dentin, or periodontal ligament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
