    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient went into shock immediately after normal delivery. The possible causes of shock in this scenario could be amniotic fluid embolism, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), uterine inversion, or eclampsia. To determine the likely cause, we need to consider the symptoms and risk factors associated with each condition. Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that can occur during or immediately after delivery. It is characterized by sudden respiratory distress, cardiovascular collapse, and coagulopathy. Postpartum hemorrhage is a common cause of shock after delivery and is characterized by excessive bleeding. Uterine inversion is a rare but serious complication where the uterus turns inside out after delivery. It can cause severe bleeding and shock. Eclampsia is a complication of preeclampsia characterized by seizures and high blood pressure. Given the limited information provided, it is difficult to definitively determine the cause of the patient's shock. However, based on the common occurrence and severity of postpartum hemorrhage, PPH is a likely cause of the patient's shock.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
