    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Type I diabetes mellitus, there is a deficiency of insulin, which leads to impaired glucose uptake by cells and increased breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver. This results in hyperglycemia and increased glucose levels in the urine, leading to polyuria. In this condition, there is increased breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver (glycogenolysis) and increased conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA (lipolysis). However, there is decreased glycogenesis in muscle due to the lack of insulin. Protein synthesis and cholesterol synthesis are not directly affected by the lack of insulin in Type I diabetes mellitus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
