    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, a material that turns to liquid on applying critical shear stress is called a Bingham body. The Bingham plastic is a type of non-Newtonian fluid that behaves as a solid below a certain critical shear stress, but flows like a viscous liquid above that threshold. This behavior is described in Document [1] (Title: Bingham plastic) and Document [17] (Title: Bingham plastic). Therefore, the correct answer is B. Bingham body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
