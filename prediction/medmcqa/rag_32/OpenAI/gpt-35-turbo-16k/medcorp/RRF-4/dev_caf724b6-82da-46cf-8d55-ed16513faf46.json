    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tumor MRI is better than CT scan, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that MRI is preferred over CT in soft-tissue tumors due to its better spatial orientation and sharper contrast. Document [1] also supports the superiority of MRI over CT in sensitivity and tumor delineation. Document [2] compares ultrasound, CT, and MRI in liver tumors, but does not provide specific information about the tumors mentioned in the question. Document [4] compares CT and MRI in detecting brain metastases and states that neither modality is clearly superior. Document [5] discusses the advantages and disadvantages of MRI in diagnosing malignant tumors, but does not provide specific information about the tumors mentioned in the question. Document [7] mentions that MRI and CT scans are non-invasive, high-resolution techniques used in the diagnosis of brain tumors, with MRI typically being the reference standard. Document [8] evaluates the criteria for detecting tumor recurrence and post-treatment changes in head and neck malignancies using CT and MRI, but does not provide specific information about the tumors mentioned in the question. Document [10] states that MRI provides better detail and detection of tumor-infiltrated areas in the central nervous system. Document [14] mentions that CT scans, PET scans, and MRI are used for monitoring tumor burden in cancer patients. Document [17] states that CT scans and MRI are the most commonly used imaging technologies for diagnosing central nervous system tumors, with MRI providing better detail and detection of tumor-infiltrated areas. Document [19] describes the use of contrast agents in CT and MRI for imaging brain tumors. Document [21] mentions that CT and MRI can be used to spot PNETs, but the results of MRI are usually ambiguous. Document [27] compares MRI and CT in soft-tissue tumors and states that MRI is better than or equal to CT in defining the anatomic extent of the tumor. Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that MRI is better than CT scan in detecting soft-tissue tumors, brain tumors, and central nervous system tumors. Therefore, the answer is C. Mesothelioma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
