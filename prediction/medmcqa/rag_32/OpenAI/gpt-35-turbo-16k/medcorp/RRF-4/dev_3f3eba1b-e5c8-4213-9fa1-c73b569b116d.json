    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how arch perimeter can be measured, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that dental arch width and length were measured using a digital vernier with 0.01mm accuracy. Document [6] describes the 'overlap method' for calculating arch perimeter, which involves measuring the mesio-distal widths of the teeth only. Document [14] discusses the use of a reflex microscope and a mathematical method for calculating arch perimeter. Based on this information, it can be concluded that arch perimeter can be measured using a digital vernier caliper, the 'overlap method' with mesio-distal tooth width measurements, or a reflex microscope with mathematical calculations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Vernier calipers\"}"
