    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the temperature of the soldering torch suddenly increases during cobalt chromium crown reconstruction, it will affect the mechanical properties of the alloy. Cobalt-chromium alloys are known to have a decrease in yield strength and an increase in percent elongation when exposed to high temperatures. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Yield strength decreases and percent elongation increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
