    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given results, we can analyze the changes in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and the presence of tremors. In the placebo-treated group, the heart rate is 72, systolic blood pressure is 110, diastolic blood pressure is 80, and tremors are absent. In the new drug-treated group, the heart rate is 86, systolic blood pressure is 150, diastolic blood pressure is 68, and tremors are present. From these results, we can infer that the new drug likely has an effect on increasing heart rate, increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and causing tremors. Based on these effects, the new drug is most likely an alpha-1 agonist and beta-2 agonist, as it would explain the increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Alpha-1 antagonist and beta-2 agonist.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
