    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the radiographic view of choice for demonstrating a nasal fracture can be determined. Let's analyze the information from the documents. Document [1] mentions that a simple radiographic imaging of the isolated nasal bone can be done by RadioVisioGraphy dental imaging system with high resolution and less radiation. Document [2] states that plain film X-rays are not typically useful for simple nasal bone fractures. Document [8] discusses a radiologic classification of nasal bone fractures using computed tomography (CT) scans. Document [11] mentions the utility of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from CT scans for planning the surgical treatment of nasal bone fractures. Document [14] describes the use of high-resolution sonography for diagnosing nasal fractures in children. Document [22] suggests that lateral ultrasound (US) can be used to detect nasal fractures in adults. Considering this information, it can be concluded that the radiographic view of choice for demonstrating a nasal fracture is not mentioned in the provided documents. Therefore, we cannot determine the answer based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
