Document [2] discusses the phenomenon of ectopic development of enamel on the root surface, which is referred to as enameloma. It states that enameloma is not well-understood and may facilitate the progression of periodontal breakdown. However, it does not provide information about the specific characteristics of enameloma. Document [10] mentions the immunohistochemical demonstration of enamel proteins in odontogenic tumors, including enameloma. While it provides information about the presence of enamel proteins in enameloma, it does not specify the characteristics of enameloma itself. Document [17] discusses the association between chronic exposure to bisphenol A and dental fluorosis, but it does not provide information about enameloma. None of the other documents directly address enameloma. Based on the available information, it is not possible to determine the true statement about enameloma.
