    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the difference between the physical characteristics of reamers and files, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] describes the characteristics of K-type files and C-type files, while Document [2] provides information about ISO files, which include reamers. Document [8] gives a general description of reamers. Document [18] provides information about the ISO stainless steel files on the market, which include K-Flex, K-Flexofile, and Hedstr\u00f6m files. After reviewing these documents, we can conclude that the correct answer is A. The cross-section of reamers is square, while files are triangular in cross-section. This is mentioned in Document [5], which states that the authors observed the cross-section of different brands of K files and reamers and found that the reality is closer to the square or triangular symbol. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
