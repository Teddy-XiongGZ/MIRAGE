    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the lateral spread of caries at the enamel-dentin junction (EDJ). It states that lateral spread is related to advanced lesions with cavity formation where the dentin is soft and infected. Document [24] supports this by stating that the dentin demineralization does not spread significantly in non-cavitated occlusal lesions. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the lateral spread of dental caries is facilitated mostly by the dentinoenamel junction (EDJ) where the dentin is soft and infected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dentinoenamel junction\"}"
