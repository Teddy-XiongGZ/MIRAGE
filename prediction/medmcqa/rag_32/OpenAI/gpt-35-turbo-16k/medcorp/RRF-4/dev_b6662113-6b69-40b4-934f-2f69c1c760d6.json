    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information about the difference between the skin and mucosa of the cheek can be found in documents [2], [6], [24], and [27]. Document [2] states that the buccal mucosa is part of the lining mucosa and is nonkeratinized. Document [6] explains that the oral mucosa consists of two layers, the surface stratified squamous epithelium and the deeper lamina propria. The epithelium may be nonkeratinized or keratinized depending on the region of the mouth. Document [24] focuses on the vermilion border of the lips, which is part of the oral mucosa, and states that the superficial epithelial cells on the lip are parakeratotic and larger than those of the cheek skin. Finally, document [27] describes the histological structure of the oral mucosa, which includes a surface squamous stratified epithelium known as the oral epithelium. Based on this information, we can conclude that the difference between the skin and mucosa of the cheek is that the skin is keratinized, while the mucosa is nonkeratinized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Keratinized mucosa of cheek\"}"
