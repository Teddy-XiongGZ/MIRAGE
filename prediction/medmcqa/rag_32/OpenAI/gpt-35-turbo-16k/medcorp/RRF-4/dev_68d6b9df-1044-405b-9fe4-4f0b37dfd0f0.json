    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At physiological pH, amino acids can exist in different charged states. To determine which amino acid has a positive charge at physiological pH, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss the charge properties of amino acids. Document [4] states that there are three amino acids with side chains that are cations at neutral pH: histidine, lysine, and arginine. Document [8] confirms that the side chains of lysine and arginine are fully ionized and positively charged at physiologic pH. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Arginine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
