    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sibilant sounds are produced by directing a stream of air with the tongue towards the teeth. This suggests that the tongue is not in a resting position, but rather in a position where it is directing the airflow. Therefore, the correct answer is not A. Occluding position refers to a complete obstruction of the airflow, which is not the case for sibilant sounds. Therefore, the correct answer is not B. Open from resting position suggests that the tongue starts from a resting position and then opens up to produce the sibilant sound. However, sibilant sounds are produced by directing the airflow towards the teeth, which indicates that the tongue is not in a resting position. Therefore, the correct answer is not C. Between rest and occluding position suggests that the tongue is in a position between resting and completely obstructing the airflow. This is consistent with the description of directing the airflow towards the teeth to produce sibilant sounds. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
