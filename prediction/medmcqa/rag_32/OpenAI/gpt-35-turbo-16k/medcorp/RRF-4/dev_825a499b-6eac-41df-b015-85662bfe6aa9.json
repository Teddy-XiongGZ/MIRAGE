    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the 8th AJCC guidelines, the staging of tongue carcinoma is based on the size of the primary tumor (T), the presence of regional lymph node involvement (N), and the presence of distant metastasis (M). In this case, the lesion on the lateral border of the tongue measures 2.5*3.5 cm and there is no associated lymphadenopathy. Based on the size of the tumor, it falls under T3 category.
