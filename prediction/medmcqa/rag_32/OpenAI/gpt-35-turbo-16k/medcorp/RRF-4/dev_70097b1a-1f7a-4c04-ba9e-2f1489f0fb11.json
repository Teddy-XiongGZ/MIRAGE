    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the most appropriate average for the given data, we need to consider the measure of central tendency that is not affected by extreme values. The arithmetic mean is affected by extreme values, so it may not be the best choice. The mode represents the most frequently occurring value, but in this case, there is no clear mode. The median represents the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. The geometric mean is used when dealing with exponential growth or decay, which is not applicable in this case. Therefore, the most appropriate average for this data would be the median, as it is not affected by extreme values and provides a representative value for the central tendency of the data.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Median\"}"
