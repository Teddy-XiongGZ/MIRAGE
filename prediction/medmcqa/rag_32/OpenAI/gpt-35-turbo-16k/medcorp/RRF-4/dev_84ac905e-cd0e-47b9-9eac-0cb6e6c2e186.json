    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the treatment of fibrous dysplasia is mainly palliative and focused on managing fractures and preventing deformity. Bisphosphonates may be helpful for treatment of bone pain, but there is no clear evidence that they strengthen bone lesions or prevent fractures. Surgical techniques such as bone grafting, curettage, and plates and screws are frequently ineffective and should be avoided. Intramedullary rods are generally preferred for management of fractures and deformity in the lower extremities. Surgical management in the craniofacial skeleton should focus on correction of functional deformities. Prophylactic optic nerve decompression is contraindicated. Radical resection of the lesion, radiation therapy, and cryosurgery are not mentioned as treatment options in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
