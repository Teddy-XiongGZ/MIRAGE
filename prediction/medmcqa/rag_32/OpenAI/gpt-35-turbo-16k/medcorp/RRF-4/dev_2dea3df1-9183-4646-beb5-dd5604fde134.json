    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. The documents mention that oral tuberculosis lesions can present with various clinical manifestations, including ulceration, granulomatous tissue, and non-healing ulcers. The documents also mention the presence of central caseation, giant cells, and epithelioid cells in the lesions. Therefore, we need to identify the characteristic that is not associated with lesions of oral tuberculosis. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Central caseation: The documents mention the presence of caseation necrosis in the oral tuberculosis lesions. Therefore, this characteristic is associated with lesions of oral tuberculosis.\\nB. Hyaline degeneration: The documents do not mention hyaline degeneration as a characteristic of oral tuberculosis lesions. Therefore, this characteristic may not be associated with lesions of oral tuberculosis.\\nC. Giant cells in the center: The documents mention the presence of giant cells in the oral tuberculosis lesions. Therefore, this characteristic is associated with lesions of oral tuberculosis.\\nD. Presence of epithelioid cells: The documents mention the presence of epithelioid cells in the oral tuberculosis lesions. Therefore, this characteristic is associated with lesions of oral tuberculosis.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the characteristic that is not associated with lesions of oral tuberculosis is hyaline degeneration. Therefore, the answer is B. Hyaline degeneration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
