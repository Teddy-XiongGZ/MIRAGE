    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Collagen is a fibrous protein that provides structural support to tissues. To determine the strength of collagen, we need to identify the key amino acids that contribute to its structure. From the provided documents, we can see that collagen is composed of repeating units of amino acids, with hydroxyproline being a crucial component. Hydroxyproline is formed from the amino acid proline through a post-translational modification. This modification is essential for the stability and strength of collagen fibers. Therefore, the strength of collagen is primarily due to hydroxyproline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
