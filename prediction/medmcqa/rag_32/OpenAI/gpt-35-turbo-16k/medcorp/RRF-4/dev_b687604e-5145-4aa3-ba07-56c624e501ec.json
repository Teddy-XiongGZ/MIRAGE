    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pressure in the vascular system in the absence of blood flow is defined as the mean circulatory filling pressure. This is the pressure that would be present if the heart were stopped and blood flow ceased throughout the entire circulatory system. It represents the pressure exerted by the blood on the walls of the blood vessels when there is no active pumping of blood by the heart. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure and is not relevant to the absence of blood flow. Critical closing pressure is the pressure at which blood flow through a blood vessel ceases, and is not relevant to the absence of blood flow. Perfusion pressure is the pressure difference that drives blood flow through the vasculature, and is not relevant to the absence of blood flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Mean circulatory filling pressure\"}"
