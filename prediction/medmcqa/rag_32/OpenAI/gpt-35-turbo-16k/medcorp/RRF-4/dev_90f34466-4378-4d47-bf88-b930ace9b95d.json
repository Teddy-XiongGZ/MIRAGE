    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most commonly used technique for determining the working length of a maxillary central incisor in an 8-year-old child patient, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [8] discusses the use of a tactile technique using absorbent paper points to estimate the working length of nonvital immature incisor teeth in children. However, this document specifically focuses on primary incisors, not permanent incisors. Document [12] mentions the use of an apex locator to determine the working length of root canals in young permanent teeth, but it does not specify the age range or tooth type. Document [28] describes the management of developmental dental alterations in permanent dentition, including impacted maxillary central incisors, but it does not mention the technique used to determine the working length. Based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively determine the most commonly used technique for determining the working length of a maxillary central incisor in an 8-year-old child patient. Therefore, the answer is D. None.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
