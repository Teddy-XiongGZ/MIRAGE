    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are proprioceptors that sense changes in muscle tension. They are located at the musculotendinous junction and provide the sensory component of the Golgi tendon reflex. The Golgi tendon organ is involved in regulating muscle contraction force and is responsible for detecting muscle tension. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Detects the muscle tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
