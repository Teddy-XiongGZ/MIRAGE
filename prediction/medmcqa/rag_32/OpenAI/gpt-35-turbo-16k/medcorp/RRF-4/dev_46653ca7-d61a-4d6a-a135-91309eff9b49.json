    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best index for burden of disease is typically the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). DALYs measure the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. It takes into account both mortality and morbidity, providing a comprehensive measure of the impact of a health problem. Case fatality rate only measures the proportion of deaths among cases, which does not capture the full burden of disease. Morbidity data provides information on the prevalence of disease, but does not quantify the impact on overall health. Dependency ratio measures the ratio of dependents to the working-age population and is not directly related to burden of disease. Therefore, the best choice is D. Disability adjusted life years.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
