    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the orbit, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the most common type in the orbital region is the MALT lymphoma. Document [2] mentions that most orbital lymphomas share particular clinicopathologic and immunologic features, suggesting an origin from a B-cell subset. Document [5] also states that low-grade lymphoma had a good prognosis in the orbital region. Based on this information, we can conclude that the most common type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the orbit is B-cell lymphoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
