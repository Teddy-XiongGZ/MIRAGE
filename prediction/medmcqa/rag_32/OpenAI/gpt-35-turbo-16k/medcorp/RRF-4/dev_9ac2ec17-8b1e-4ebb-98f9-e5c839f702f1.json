    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which material is not applied for root conditioning after placement of MTA, we need to review the relevant documents for information on root conditioning materials. Document [10] mentions the use of an endodontic irrigant called MTAD (mixture of tetracycline, citric acid, and detergent) as a root conditioning agent. Document [12] discusses the unintentional extrusion of MTA during apical barrier treatment and does not mention any specific root conditioning materials. Document [22] evaluates the effect of intracanal medications on the bond strength of calcium silicate-based cements, but does not mention root conditioning materials. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the material not applied for root conditioning after placement of MTA is EDTA, as it is not mentioned in any of the relevant documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
