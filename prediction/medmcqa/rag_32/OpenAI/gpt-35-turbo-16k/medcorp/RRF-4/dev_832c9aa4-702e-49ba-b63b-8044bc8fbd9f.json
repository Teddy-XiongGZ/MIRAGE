    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cements should not be used to cement acrylic temporary crowns, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [1] states that adhesive cements should not be used for temporary crowns and that softer cements are preferred for easy removal. Document [22] mentions that Zinc Oxide Eugenol (ZOE) temporary luting cements should not be used when resin composite is planned for bonding the definitive crown. Based on this information, we can conclude that the answer is A. Zinc oxide eugenol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
