    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phase-contrast microscopy is based on the principle of separating the illuminating (background) light from the specimen-scattered light and manipulating them differently. The phase-shifted scattered light from the object is then converted into brightness changes in the image. This principle allows for the visualization of phase changes in the specimen, which are related to the refractive index differences between the object and the surrounding medium. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Different refractive indices of object.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
