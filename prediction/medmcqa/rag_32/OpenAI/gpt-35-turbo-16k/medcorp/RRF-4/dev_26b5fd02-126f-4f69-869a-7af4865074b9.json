    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the endocochlear potential (EP) is described as a positive voltage. Document [0] states that the EP is positive and varies in magnitude along the cochlea, with the highest EP in the basal turn. Document [2] also mentions that the resting endolymphatic potential of a normal cochlea is +80 mV. Therefore, the correct answer is D. +85 mV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
