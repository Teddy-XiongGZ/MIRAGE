    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyaline membrane disease, also known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), is characterized by the presence of hyaline membranes in the lungs. These hyaline membranes are composed of fibrin, cellular debris, red blood cells, and leukocytes. They line or fill the air spaces in the lungs, blocking gas exchange. As a result, blood passing through the lungs is unable to pick up oxygen and unload carbon dioxide. Blood oxygen levels fall and carbon dioxide rises, resulting in rising blood acid levels and hypoxia. Therefore, the correct answer is C. FRC is equal to closing volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
