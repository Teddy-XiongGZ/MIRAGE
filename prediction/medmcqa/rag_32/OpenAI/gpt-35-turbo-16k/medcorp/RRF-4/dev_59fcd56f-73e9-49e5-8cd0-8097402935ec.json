    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Immunologically active cells are cells that play a role in the immune response. From the provided documents, we can gather information about different types of immune cells. Plasma cells are B lymphocytes that have differentiated and produce antibodies, so they are immunologically active. MAST cells are not mentioned in the provided documents. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response against parasites and allergic reactions, so they are immunologically active. R.B.Cs (red blood cells) are not directly involved in the immune response, so they are not considered immunologically active cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
