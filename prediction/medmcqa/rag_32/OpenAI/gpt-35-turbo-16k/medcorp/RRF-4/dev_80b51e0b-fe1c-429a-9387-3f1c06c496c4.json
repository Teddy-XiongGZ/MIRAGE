    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on drug distribution and tissue storage. Document [0] mentions that the concentration ratios of drugs in adipose tissue and lean tissues can be influenced by binding competition. Document [1] suggests that adipose tissue storage of drugs is mainly influenced by the basicity of the drugs. Document [4] explains that the distribution of a drug between tissues depends on factors such as vascular permeability, regional blood flow, and the ability of the drug to bind tissue and plasma proteins. Based on this information, it can be inferred that storage of drugs in tissues is suggested by a large volume of distribution, as it allows for the drug to be distributed into various tissues, including adipose tissue. Therefore, the answer is A. Large volume of distribution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
