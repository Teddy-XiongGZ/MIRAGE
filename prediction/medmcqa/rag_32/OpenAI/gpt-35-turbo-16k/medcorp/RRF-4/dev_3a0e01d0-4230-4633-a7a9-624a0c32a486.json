    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by binding to the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin III (AT III) and enhancing its inhibitory activity against several serine proteases of the coagulation system, including thrombin (Factor IIa) and Factor Xa. This binding causes conformational changes in AT III, leading to the inactivation of thrombin and Factor Xa. Therefore, the main mechanism of action of heparin is to prevent the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (Choice B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
