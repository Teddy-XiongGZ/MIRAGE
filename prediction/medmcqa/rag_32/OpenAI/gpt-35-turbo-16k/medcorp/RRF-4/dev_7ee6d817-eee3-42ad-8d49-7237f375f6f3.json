    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the biomarker of alcoholic hepatitis, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that currently, there are limited biomarkers to diagnose and prognosticate in alcoholic hepatitis. Document [1] states that numerous biomarkers have been associated with alcoholic hepatitis, but no ideal biomarker has been identified. Document [3] mentions that C-reactive protein (CRP) is an accurate marker of alcoholic hepatitis. Document [4] also supports the idea that CRP is a good marker of alcoholic hepatitis. Document [15] states that Keratin 18 (KRT18) is a diagnostic and prognostic factor for acute alcoholic hepatitis. Based on this information, the biomarker of alcoholic hepatitis is most likely CRP or KRT18.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. GGT\"}"
