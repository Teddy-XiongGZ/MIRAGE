    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Placing the maxillary teeth too far anteriorly and superiorly in a complete denture can affect the pronunciation of certain sounds. To determine which sounds are affected, we can refer to Document [4]. This document discusses the influence of the bucco-lingual position of upper posterior artificial teeth on pronunciation. It states that pronunciation disorders caused by the arrangement of the upper posterior artificial teeth occur when the lingual surfaces of the upper molars are located more than 1/4 inward of the distance between the right and left denture border from the buccal denture border or less than 1/10 of that distance outward from the buccal denture border. The document also mentions that the influence of the arrangement of the upper posterior artificial teeth on pronunciation depends on the vowel following the consonant of the sound. When the vowel following the consonant is a back vowel, such as 'ka', 'kw', and 'ko', the sound is barely influenced. However, when the vowel is a front vowel, such as 'ke' and 'ki', the sound is markedly influenced. Based on this information, we can conclude that placing the maxillary teeth too far anteriorly and superiorly in a complete denture would most likely result in faulty pronunciation of front vowel sounds, such as 'ke' and 'ki'. Therefore, the correct answer is B. S and T sounds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
