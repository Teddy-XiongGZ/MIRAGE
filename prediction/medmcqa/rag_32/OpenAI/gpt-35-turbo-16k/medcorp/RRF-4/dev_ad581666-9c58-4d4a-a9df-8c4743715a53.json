    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a molecule group from one molecule to another is classified as a transferase. Transferases are enzymes that transfer specific functional groups from one molecule (donor) to another molecule (acceptor). This is mentioned in Document [1] which states that transferases catalyze the transfer of specific functional groups from one molecule to another. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Transferases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
