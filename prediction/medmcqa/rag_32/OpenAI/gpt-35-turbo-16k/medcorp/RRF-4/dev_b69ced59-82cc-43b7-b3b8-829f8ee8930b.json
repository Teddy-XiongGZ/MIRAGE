    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is released from alpha granules in platelets. Document [2] states that platelet-derived growth factor stimulates the growth of mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. Document [3] also mentions that platelets release PDGF, along with other growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, the correct answer is D. Alpha granules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
