    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acrocephaly is a condition characterized by the premature closure of the cranial sutures, resulting in a tower-shaped or peaked head. To determine the alternative names for acrocephaly, we need to search for relevant information in the provided documents. Document [2] mentions that premature closure of the cranial sutures can lead to acrocephaly, also referred to as turricephaly and oxycephaly. Document [3] also states that oxycephaly is a type of cephalic disorder where the top of the skull is pointed or conical due to premature closure of the coronal suture plus any other suture. Therefore, the alternative names for acrocephaly are oxycephaly and turricephaly. Dome-shaped skull is not mentioned as an alternative name for acrocephaly. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
