    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine what the dentist must determine before an arbitrary face bow transfer record, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that the face-bow transfer allows for a more accurate arc of closure on the articulator when the interocclusal records are removed and the articulator is closed. Document [3] states that the use of an arbitrary face-bow significantly improves the transfer reliability and validity. Document [6] describes an alternative procedure for face-bow transfer without a plane of reference, using the angular relationship between the occlusal plane and the condylar path. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the dentist must determine the axial centre of rotation of the condyle before an arbitrary face bow transfer record.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
