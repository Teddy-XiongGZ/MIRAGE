    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tetrazolium chloride staining is used to assess myocardial viability. It stains viable myocardium red, while infarcted or necrotic myocardium remains unstained. Since the patient had severe chest pain and died on the way to the hospital, it suggests a possible myocardial infarction. Therefore, the color of the infarcted myocardium stained with tetrazolium chloride would be unstained or pale, indicating necrosis. So the answer is not A (Red) or D (Pink). The color of the infarcted myocardium stained with tetrazolium chloride is typically pale or white, not blue or dark brown. Therefore, the answer is B (Blue).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
