    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient gives a history of chuna falling into his eyes, indicating a potential ocular injury. The immediate management in such cases would typically involve irrigation of both eyes with copious amounts of normal saline to flush out any remaining chuna particles. This helps to minimize the potential damage caused by the alkali burn. Therefore, option A is a part of the immediate management. Frequent sodium citrate drops may be used to help neutralize the alkali, so option B could also be a part of the management. Thorough slit-lamp examination on presentation is important to assess the extent of the ocular injury, so option C is also a part of the management.

Therefore, the answer choice is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
