    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about RVG, we need to examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] mentions Radiovisiography (RVG) as a technique for assessing endodontic working length. Document [12] discusses the accuracy of RVG compared to conventional film radiographs for detecting occlusal caries. Document [19] compares the accuracy of RVG to conventional film radiographs and digitized film radiographs for detecting dentinal caries. Document [25] compares the accuracy of RVG to conventional film radiographs and digitized radiographs for detecting dentinal caries in occlusal surfaces. Based on this information, we can conclude that statement D, 'Image is sharper than caused by silver halide,' is not true about RVG, as the documents do not provide any information about the sharpness of RVG images compared to silver halide images.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
