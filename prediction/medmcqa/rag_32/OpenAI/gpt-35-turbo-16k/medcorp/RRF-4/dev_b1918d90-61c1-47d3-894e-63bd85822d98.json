    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid axonal flow refers to the fast axonal transport, which is responsible for the movement of vesicular cargoes in the axon. According to Document [3], fast axonal transport is mediated by motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin. Neurofilaments are part of the slow axonal transport, as mentioned in Document [4]. Microtubules, on the other hand, act as the 'rails' for transport, as stated in Document [28]. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Neurofilaments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
