    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The use of stress breaker in modern dentistry is mentioned in multiple documents. Document [0] states that the stress breaker framework used in a movable partial prosthesis allows for the preservation of the abutments as well as the conservation of osseo-mucous tissues. Document [1] mentions that the magnetic attachment with stress breaker reduces lateral forces on abutment teeth. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the use of stress breaker does not negatively affect the abutment teeth. There is no mention in the documents that the use of stress breaker affects the alveolar ridge. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
