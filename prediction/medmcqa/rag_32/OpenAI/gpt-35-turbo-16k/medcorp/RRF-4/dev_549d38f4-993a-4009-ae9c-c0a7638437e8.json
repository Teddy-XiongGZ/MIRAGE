    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the ideal depth of MTA for root end filling material, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [8] titled 'Influence of the thickness of mineral trioxide aggregate on sealing ability of root-end fillings in vitro' provides information on the topic. According to this document, the study compared the ability of different thicknesses of MTA to prevent apical leakage. The results showed that the 4-mm-thick MTA was significantly more effective in preventing apical leakage compared to other thicknesses tested. Therefore, based on this information, the ideal depth of MTA for root end filling material would be 4 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
