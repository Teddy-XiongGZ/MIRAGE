    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Condensation reactions involve the combination of two molecules to form a single molecule, usually with the loss of a small molecule such as water. From the provided documents, we can see that condensation reactions occur in various contexts, including organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, and prebiotic synthesis. However, there is no specific mention of condensation reactions occurring in agar, alginate, polysulfide, or ZOE. Therefore, none of the given choices are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
