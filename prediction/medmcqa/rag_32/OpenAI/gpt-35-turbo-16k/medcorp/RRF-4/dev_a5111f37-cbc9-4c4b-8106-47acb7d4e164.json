    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The curve of occlusion touching the buccal and lingual surfaces of mandibular buccal cuspal teeth is called the Curve of Wilson. The Curve of Wilson refers to the upward (U-shaped) curvature of the maxillary and mandibular occlusal planes in the coronal plane. It is different from the Curve of Spee, which is the curvature of the mandibular occlusal plane beginning at the canine and following the buccal cusps of the posterior teeth, continuing to the terminal molar. The Curve of Monson is not relevant to this question. The catenary curve is not specific to the occlusion of teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
