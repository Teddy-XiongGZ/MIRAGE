    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the correct answer by eliminating the options that are true for myelinated nerve fibers. \\n\\nA. Impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers: This is not true. Myelinated fibers conduct impulses faster than non-myelinated fibers.\\n\\nB. Membrane currents are generated at nodes of Ranvier: This is true. Membrane currents are generated at the nodes of Ranvier, which are the gaps in the myelin sheath.\\n\\nC. Saltatory conduction of impulses is seen: This is true. Saltatory conduction, which is the rapid jumping of the nerve impulse from one node of Ranvier to another, is seen in myelinated nerve fibers.\\n\\nD. Local anesthesia is effective only when the nerve is not covered by myelin sheath: This is true. Local anesthesia is more effective on non-myelinated fibers compared to myelinated fibers. \\n\\nTherefore, the answer is A. Impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
