    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common infection post solid organ transplantation, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that bacterial infections are the most frequent complication after solid organ transplantation, particularly in organ transplantation involving the abdominal cavity. Document [13] mentions that Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. are the most common fungal pathogens in solid organ transplant recipients. Document [26] discusses respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, polyomavirus, erythrovirus B19, and measles, in solid organ transplant recipients. However, none of the documents specifically mention CMV, HSV, EBV, or HPV as the most common infection post solid organ transplantation. Based on the information provided, the most common infection post solid organ transplantation is likely bacterial infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
