    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Overload of denture base refers to excessive pressure or stress on the denture base, which can lead to discomfort, tissue damage, and denture fractures. To determine the cause of overload, we need to consider factors that can contribute to increased pressure or stress on the denture base. Looking at the relevant documents, there are several factors mentioned that can contribute to overload, such as poor denture fit, improper denture design, and excessive occlusal forces. However, none of the documents specifically mention the size of the denture base or teeth as a direct cause of overload. Therefore, we can conclude that neither small bases nor large bases, nor small teeth or large teeth, are directly responsible for causing overload of the denture base.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
