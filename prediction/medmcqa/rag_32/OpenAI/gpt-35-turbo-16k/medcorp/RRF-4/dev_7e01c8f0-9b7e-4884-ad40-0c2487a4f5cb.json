    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is false about bone marrow biopsy, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [12] states that bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including infiltrative and granulomatous disorders. Document [21] mentions that bone marrow aspiration and needle biopsy should be performed at the same time routinely, indicating that breath holding may be necessary during the procedure. However, there is no specific information in the documents about the position in which the biopsy is performed or any contraindications related to platelet count. Therefore, we can conclude that the false statement is: D. Contraindicated when platelet count is below 40,000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
