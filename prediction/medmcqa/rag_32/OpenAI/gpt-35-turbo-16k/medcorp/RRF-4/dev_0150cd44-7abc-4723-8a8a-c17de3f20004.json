    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biomineralization is the process by which inorganic metals are incorporated into biological structures. To determine the example of biomineralization, we can look for information about organisms that produce mineralized tissues or structures. Document [0] mentions that examples of biomineralization include silicates in algae and diatoms, carbonates in invertebrates, and calcium phosphates and carbonates in vertebrates. Document [6] specifically mentions the shells of invertebrates, such as molluscs, as an example of biomineralization. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Mollusc shell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
