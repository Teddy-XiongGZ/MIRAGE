    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that is added to ampicillin to enhance its antibacterial effect. Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that can inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ampicillin. By inhibiting beta-lactamases, clavulanic acid prevents the inactivation of ampicillin, allowing it to effectively target and kill bacteria. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Inhibition of \u03b2-lactamases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
