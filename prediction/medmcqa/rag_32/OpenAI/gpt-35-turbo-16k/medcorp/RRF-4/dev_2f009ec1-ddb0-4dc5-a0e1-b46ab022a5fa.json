    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chewing stroke refers to the movement of the mandible during the process of chewing. To determine where the chewing stroke starts, we can refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that the closing strokes were more stable than the opening strokes during chewing. Document [1] states that stage II transport (oro-pharyngeal bolus transport) starts at four-fifths of the way along the progress of mastication. Document [2] mentions that the number of chewing strokes is counted by considering the opening and closing movements of the mandible. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the chewing stroke starts from the opening phase (CO) and ends at the closing phase (CR) of the mandible. Therefore, the answer is B. CR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
