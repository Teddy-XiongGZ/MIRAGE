There is no periapical lesion in the radiograph. In this case, the treatment of choice would be Ca(OH)2 pulp capping. This procedure involves placing a calcium hydroxide dressing on the exposed pulp to promote healing and dentin bridge formation. It is a conservative approach that aims to preserve the vitality of the pulp and promote continued root development in immature teeth.

Conventional root canal treatment and complete debridement and apexification are more invasive procedures that are usually reserved for cases with irreversible pulpitis or necrotic pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
