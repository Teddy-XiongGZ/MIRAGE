    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in major connector construction involves designing the stress bearing areas. This is important because the major connector is responsible for transmitting forces from the prosthesis to the supporting structures in the oral cavity. The stress bearing areas need to be designed in a way that can distribute the forces evenly and minimize the risk of damage or discomfort to the patient. Once the stress bearing areas are designed, the non stress bearing areas can be determined and designed accordingly. Marking the outline of the strapline and selecting the strap type are subsequent steps in the major connector construction process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
