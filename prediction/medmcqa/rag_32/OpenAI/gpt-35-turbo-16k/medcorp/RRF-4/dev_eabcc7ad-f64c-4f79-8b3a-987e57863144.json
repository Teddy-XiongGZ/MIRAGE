    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the component that is not part of the Manning score/Biophysical score. To answer this, we need to refer to the relevant documents that describe the components of the Manning score/Biophysical score. Document [0] describes the components of the Biophysical profile as fetal heart rate, fetal breathing, fetal movement, fetal tone, and amniotic fluid volume. Document [1] also mentions the five components as heart rate acceleration, breathing, movements, tone, and amniotic fluid volume. Based on these documents, we can conclude that the components of the Manning score/Biophysical score are fetal heart rate, fetal breathing, fetal movement, fetal tone, and amniotic fluid volume. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Oxytocin challenge test, as it is not mentioned as one of the components in the relevant documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
