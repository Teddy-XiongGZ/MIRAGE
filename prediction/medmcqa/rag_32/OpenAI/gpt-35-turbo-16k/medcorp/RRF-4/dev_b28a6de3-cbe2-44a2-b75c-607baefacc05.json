    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a special process for endotracheal intubation used in high-risk patients. It involves several precautions to minimize the time between giving the induction drugs and securing the tube. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Inducing agent and neuromuscular relaxant are administered together: This is true. In RSI, the inducing agent and neuromuscular relaxant are administered in rapid succession with no time allowed for manual ventilation.\\n\\nB. The patient is pre-oxygenated for 3 minutes before the procedure: This is not true. Pre-oxygenation is an important step in RSI, but it typically lasts for 3-5 minutes, not specifically 3 minutes.\\n\\nC. Cricoid pressure has to be applied till the endotracheal tube has been secured with a cuff: This is true. Cricoid pressure, also known as the Sellick maneuver, is applied during RSI to occlude the esophagus and prevent aspiration. It is typically maintained until the endotracheal tube cuff has been inflated.\\n\\nD. Induction should be done with thiopentone sodium and succinylcholine for muscle relaxation: This is not true. While thiopentone sodium and succinylcholine have been traditionally used in RSI, there are alternative induction agents and neuromuscular relaxants available. The choice of drugs may vary depending on the patient's condition and the preferences of the healthcare provider.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
