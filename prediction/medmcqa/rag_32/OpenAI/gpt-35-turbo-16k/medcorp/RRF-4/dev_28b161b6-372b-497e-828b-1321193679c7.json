    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is important to consider the direction of forces acting through a fixed partial denture on the abutment tooth. Document [0] states that axial types of loads produce compressive stresses on the periodontium, while oblique or horizontal types of loads produce zones of compressive and tensile stresses. Document [4] mentions that forces in the single abutment are resisted along the long axis of the root. Considering these statements, the forces acting through a fixed partial denture on the abutment tooth should be directed parallel to the long axis of the teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
