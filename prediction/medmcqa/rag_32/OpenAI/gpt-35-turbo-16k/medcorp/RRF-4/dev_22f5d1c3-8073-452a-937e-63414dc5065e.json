    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is false, we need to analyze each statement and see if it is true or false for light cure composite. \\n\\nA. Held at distance of 1 mm from tooth: This statement is true. Light cure composite is typically held at a distance of 1 mm from the tooth surface to ensure proper curing.\\n\\nB. Use of orange glass shield for eye protection: This statement is true. The use of orange glass shields is recommended during light curing procedures to protect the eyes from harmful UV radiation.\\n\\nC. Polymerization reaction continues for a period of 72 hours: This statement is false. The polymerization reaction of light cure composite typically completes within a few minutes of light exposure, not 72 hours.\\n\\nD. Adding increments of 1-2 mm: This statement is true. When placing light cure composite, it is recommended to add increments of 1-2 mm to ensure proper curing and minimize shrinkage.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, statement C is false, as the polymerization reaction of light cure composite does not continue for a period of 72 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
