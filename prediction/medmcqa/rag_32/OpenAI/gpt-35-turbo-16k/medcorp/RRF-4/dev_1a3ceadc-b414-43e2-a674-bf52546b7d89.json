    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which antibiotic interferes with DNA function, we need to look for information about antibiotics that specifically target DNA. Document [1] mentions that DNA inhibitors, such as nitrofurantoin and metronidazole, act upon anaerobic bacteria by generating metabolites that are incorporated into DNA strands, making them more prone to breakage. Therefore, the antibiotic that interferes with DNA function is Metronidazole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
