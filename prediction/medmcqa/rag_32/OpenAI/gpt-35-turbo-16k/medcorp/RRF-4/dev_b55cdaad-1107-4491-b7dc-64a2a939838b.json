    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tumors steroids do not have a role in management, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that steroids have been demonstrated to possess an anticancer effect or antiswelling effect and can improve refractory symptoms in oncology. Document [1] and Document [2] specifically discuss the use of steroids in the management of brain metastases, recommending corticosteroids for symptomatic relief. Document [3] mentions that there is no robust evidence of risk in using corticosteroids in patients with cancer and COVID-19. Document [4] does not provide any information about the use of steroids in tumor management. Document [5] provides general information about adrenal steroids and their role in regulating electrolyte and water levels. Document [6] discusses the interaction of hsp90 with receptors for steroid hormones, but does not provide information about tumor management. Document [7] mentions the metabolism of estrone sulfate in ovarian tumors but does not discuss the use of steroids in tumor management. Document [8] mentions the use of targeted molecular therapies in adrenal cortical cancers but does not provide information about the use of steroids. Document [9] provides a list of synthetic steroid hormones but does not discuss their use in tumor management. Document [10] discusses the correlation between histological grading of endometrial carcinomas and steroid receptor content but does not provide information about tumor management. Document [11] mentions Lyle Alzado's claim that steroid abuse led to his brain tumor, but this claim has been disputed. Document [12] provides a list of steroid esters but does not discuss their use in tumor management. Document [13] discusses the use of steroids in combination with CTLA-4 inhibitors for advanced lung cancer and metastatic melanoma. Document [14] mentions steroid hormone-secreting ovarian stromal tumors but does not discuss the use of steroids in tumor management. Document [15] mentions the use of systemic therapies for recurrent meningioma but does not specifically mention steroids. Document [16] discusses the loss of tuberin in subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and angiomyolipomas but does not discuss the use of steroids. Document [17] mentions the upregulation of DLC1 by progesterone in ovarian cancers but does not discuss the use of steroids in tumor management. Document [18] provides a review of the effects of different agents in oncological practice, including steroids, but does not specifically mention tumor management. Document [19] proposes a hypothesis about the role of aflatoxin B1 and polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogens in the deletion of genes necessary for differentiation, but does not discuss the use of steroids in tumor management. Document [20] discusses the molecular intersection between receptors of steroid hormones and transcription factors involved in inflammation and cancer cells, but does not provide information about tumor management. Document [21] mentions radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors but does not discuss the use of steroids. Document [22] reviews the evidence for prescribing steroids for non-specific symptoms in patients with advanced carcinoma but does not specifically mention tumor management. Document [23] discusses the spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas but does not provide information about the use of steroids in tumor management. Document [24] mentions the use of steroids and other treatments for stiff-person syndrome but does not discuss their use in tumor management. Document [25] mentions the use of corticosteroids in the treatment and management of thymic tumors. Document [26] discusses the induction of hepatocellular adenomas by anabolic androgenic steroids but does not provide information about the use of steroids in tumor management. Document [27] mentions the use of radiographic studies in the diagnosis of bony tumors but does not specifically mention steroids. Document [28] discusses the involvement of progesterone in the growth regulation of tumors but does not provide information about the use of steroids in tumor management. Document [29] discusses the management of sarcomas but does not specifically mention steroids. Document [30] provides general information about steroids but does not discuss their use in tumor management. Document [31] discusses the molecular genetic abnormalities in embryonal tumors but does not provide information about the use of steroids in tumor management. Based on the information provided, there is no mention of steroids having a role in the management of Kaposi sarcoma, Chronic lymphoid leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or Multiple myeloma. Therefore, the answer is D. Multiple myeloma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
