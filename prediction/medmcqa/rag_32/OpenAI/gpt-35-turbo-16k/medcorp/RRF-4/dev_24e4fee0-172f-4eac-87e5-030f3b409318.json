    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which material is most elastic, we need to consider the elastic modulus or Young's modulus of each material. The elastic modulus quantifies the amount of stress needed to achieve a unit of strain, with a higher modulus indicating a material that is harder to deform. Unfortunately, the provided documents do not directly mention the elastic modulus of the specific materials listed in the answer choices. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine which material is most elastic based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"N/A\"}"
