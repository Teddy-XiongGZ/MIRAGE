    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogenesis is the process of glycogen synthesis, while glycogenolysis is the process of glycogen breakdown. To determine the enzyme that is common between glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, we need to identify the enzymes involved in both processes. Glycogen synthase is responsible for glycogen synthesis, while glycogen phosphorylase is responsible for glycogen breakdown. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Glycogen phosphorylase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
