    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the shape of the occlusal surface of the permanent maxillary first molar, we need to find information about its morphology in the relevant documents. Document [1] describes the occlusal surface of the maxillary first molar as consisting of the mesiobuccal, distolingual, mesiolingual, and distobuccal cusps. It also mentions that the occlusal surface is rectangular. None of the documents specifically mention the shape as oval, trapezoidal, triangular, or rhomboidal. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the shape of the occlusal surface of the permanent maxillary first molar is rectangular.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
