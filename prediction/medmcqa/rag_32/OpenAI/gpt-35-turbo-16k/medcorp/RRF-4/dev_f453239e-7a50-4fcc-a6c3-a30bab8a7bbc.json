    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the best biochemical description of glucose by eliminating the incorrect options. Option A is incorrect because glucose is an aldose sugar, not a ketose sugar. Option B is incorrect because glucose is typically found in the D-isomeric form in biological systems, not the L-isomeric form. Option D is incorrect because glucose is a monosaccharide, not a disaccharide. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, which states that glucose is a C-4 epimer of galactose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
