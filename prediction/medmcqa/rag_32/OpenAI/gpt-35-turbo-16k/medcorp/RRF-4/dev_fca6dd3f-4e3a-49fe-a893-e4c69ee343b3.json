    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has avulsed his central incisor 20 minutes back and the tooth is contaminated with debris. The first step should be to clean the root surface of the avulsed tooth to remove any debris and contaminants. This can be done by gently rinsing the tooth with saline solution. After cleaning the root surface, the tooth should be reimplanted back into its socket. Reimplantation should be done carefully to ensure proper alignment and positioning of the tooth. Once the tooth is reimplanted, further treatment options can be considered depending on the condition of the tooth and the patient's age. In this case, since the child is 8 years old, it is recommended to perform root canal treatment (RCT) to prevent infection and promote healing. Therefore, the correct treatment option in this case would be to clean the root surface with saline and reimplant the tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
