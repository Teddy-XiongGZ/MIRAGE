    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which condition is not true regarding false positive results on EPT testing, we need to understand what EPT testing is and what conditions can lead to false positive results. EPT stands for Electric Pulp Testing, which is a method used to assess the vitality of dental pulp. False positive results occur when the test indicates a positive response (indicating vitality) even though the condition being tested for is not present. Going through the documents, we can find information about EPT testing in Document [4] (Title: Pulpitis) and Document [20] (Title: COVID-19 testing). From these documents, we can gather that conditions such as improper isolation, partial pulpal necrosis, and anxiety can potentially lead to false positive results on EPT testing. However, there is no mention of the condition 'immature apex' in relation to false positive results on EPT testing. Therefore, the answer choice that is not true regarding false positive results on EPT testing is A. Immature apex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
