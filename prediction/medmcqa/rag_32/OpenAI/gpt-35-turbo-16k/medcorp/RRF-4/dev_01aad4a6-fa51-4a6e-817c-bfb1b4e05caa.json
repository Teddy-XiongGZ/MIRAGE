    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Good clinical practice (GCP) is observed in all phases of clinical trials to ensure ethical and scientific quality standards. Preclinical trials, which involve laboratory testing and animal studies, are not considered clinical trials and therefore do not fall under the scope of GCP. Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III trials are all part of the clinical trial process and are subject to GCP guidelines. Phase V trials, also known as post-marketing surveillance trials, occur after a drug or treatment has been approved and are primarily focused on monitoring the long-term safety and effectiveness of the treatment in a larger population. While GCP principles may still be relevant in Phase V trials, they are not explicitly required as in the earlier phases. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Phase V.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
