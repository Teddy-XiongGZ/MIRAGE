    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which inflammatory mediator is involved in intracellular killing of microbes, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [8] discusses the mechanisms by which phagocytic cells destroy intracellular microorganisms. It mentions that various mechanisms can lead to intracellular killing, some of which depend on oxidative processes, whereas others are independent of the oxidative metabolism. The former involve the activation of membrane enzyme systems that lead to a stimulation of oxygen uptake (the 'respiratory burst'), and its reduction to molecular species that are highly toxic for microorganisms. This suggests that oxidase, which is involved in the respiratory burst and the production of reactive oxygen species, is the inflammatory mediator involved in intracellular killing of microbes. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Oxidase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
