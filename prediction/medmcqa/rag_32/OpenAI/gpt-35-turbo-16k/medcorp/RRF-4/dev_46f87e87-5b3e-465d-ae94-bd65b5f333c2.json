    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is not involved in blood clotting, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] explains that coagulation involves activation, adhesion, and aggregation of platelets, as well as deposition and maturation of fibrin. Document [3] states that clotting occurs in association with membranes on the surface of platelets and damaged blood vessels. Document [5] mentions that fibrinogen concentration is critical to blood clot formation. Document [9] states that clotting factors XIII, XII, XI, X, IX, VII, V, II, and I are manufactured principally in hepatocytes. Document [18] explains that thrombocytes are the components of blood involved in blood clotting. Based on this information, we can determine that all of the options (A. Calcium, B. Prothrombin, C. Fibrinogen, D. Fe+2) are involved in blood clotting. Therefore, none of the options is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
