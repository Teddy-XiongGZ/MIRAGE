    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which drug does not require dose adjustment in renal disease, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [27] states that drugs usually eliminated by the kidneys require the most modification in renal disease. Document [30] mentions that for drugs in which >70% excretion is by a nonrenal route, such as hepatic elimination, dose adjustment may not be needed. Based on this information, we can eliminate drugs that are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, such as aminoglycosides and metronidazole. Document [7] states that calcium channel blockers should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate, indicating that dose adjustment is required for this drug. Therefore, the drug that does not require dose adjustment in renal disease is B. Vancomycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
