    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eisenmenger syndrome is characterized by pulmonary hypertension and a reversal of a left-to-right shunt to a right-to-left shunt. Let's go through each option:\\n\\nA. Pulmonary veins are not distended: This is true. In Eisenmenger syndrome, the pulmonary veins are not distended because the blood flow is redirected from the right side of the heart to the left side.\\n\\nB. RV & LV walls come back to normal size: This is false. In Eisenmenger syndrome, the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) undergo hypertrophy due to the increased workload.\\n\\nC. Dilatation of central pulmonary artery: This is true. In Eisenmenger syndrome, there is dilatation of the central pulmonary artery due to the increased pulmonary arterial pressure.\\n\\nD. Peripheral pruning of pulmonary arteries: This is true. In Eisenmenger syndrome, there is peripheral pruning of the pulmonary arteries, which means that the smaller pulmonary arteries become narrowed or blocked.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
