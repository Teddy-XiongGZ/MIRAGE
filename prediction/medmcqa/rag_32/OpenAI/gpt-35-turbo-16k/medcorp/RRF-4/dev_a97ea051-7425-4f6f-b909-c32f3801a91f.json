    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which G-protein coupled receptor does not act through opening of potassium channels, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that G protein-gated ion channels are primarily found in CNS neurons and atrial myocytes, and affect the flow of potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl\u2212) across the plasma membrane. Document [3] mentions that the G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) are activated by ligand-stimulated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are permeable to potassium ions. Document [6] provides examples of GPCRs that activate GIRKs, including the M2-muscarinic, D2-dopamine, and 5-HT1A serotonin receptors. Based on this information, we can conclude that the G-protein coupled receptor that does not act through opening of potassium channels is the Angiotensin 1 receptor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
