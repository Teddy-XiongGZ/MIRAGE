    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can evaluate each statement to determine if it is true or false. \\n\\nA. 30% of trisomy 21 fetus die in utero: This statement is true. Document [7] states that most embryos cannot survive with a missing or extra autosome, and the most common aneuploidy that infants can survive with is trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), affecting 1 in 800 births. \\n\\nB. 80% of trisomy 18 fetus die in utero: This statement is false. Document [7] states that trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) affects 1 in 6,000 births, and 10% of infants with trisomy 18 reach 1 year of age. It does not mention that 80% of trisomy 18 fetuses die in utero. \\n\\nC. Occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age: This statement is false. Document [24] states that maternal age is a risk factor for most, if not all, human trisomies. \\n\\nD. The recurrence risk for nondysjunctional aneuploidy is 1% higher: This statement is not addressed in the provided documents, so we cannot determine its truthfulness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
