    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the thickness of the cement-dentinal junction is not explicitly mentioned. However, Document [2] states that the cemento-dentinal junction is an approximately 1-3-micron-thick layer. Therefore, the thickness of the cement-dentinal junction is estimated to be within the range of 1-3 \u03bcm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 1-2 \u03bcm\"}"
