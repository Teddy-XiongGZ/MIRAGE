    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the pure histological landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the difficulty of achieving an artificial apical stop in cases where the apical foramen is wide or the apex of the root is incompletely formed. Document [2] compares the quality of obturation achieved with different root filling systems and evaluates the volumetric percentage of gaps and voids at different canal levels. Document [5] emphasizes the importance of sealing the entire prepared length of the root canal to prevent bacterial re-entry. Based on this information, we can conclude that the pure histological landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation is the apical constriction, which is the narrowest part of the root canal located near the apical foramen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
