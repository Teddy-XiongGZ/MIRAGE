    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which complications are more common in ventouse assisted delivery than forceps, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] compares the outcomes of ventouse and forceps deliveries and states that there were no significant differences in neonatal morbidity between the two groups. Document [4] also compares the outcomes of vacuum and forceps application and reports that there were no statistically significant differences in neonatal morbidity between the two groups. However, Document [10] mentions that forceps and ventouse extractions are associated with a higher risk of neonatal complications, including cephalhematoma. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is B. Cephalhematoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
