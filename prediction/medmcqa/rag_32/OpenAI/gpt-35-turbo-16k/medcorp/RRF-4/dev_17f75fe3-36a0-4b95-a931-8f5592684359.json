    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the answer by analyzing the descriptions of the Bennett angle. Document [4] states that the Bennett angle is the angle between the midsagittal plane and the curve of the non-working condyle. Document [16] also mentions that the Bennett angle is the difference between a sagittal plane established through the condyle at rest and a line through the lateral movement's non-working condyle. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The Bennett angle is the angle which the path of the balancing side condyle makes with the sagittal plane during lateral excursion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
