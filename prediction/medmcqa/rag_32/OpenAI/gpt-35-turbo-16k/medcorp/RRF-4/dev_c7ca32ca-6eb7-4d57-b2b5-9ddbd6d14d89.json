    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the angle between the adhesive and adherent is zero degrees, it indicates complete wetting of surfaces. This means that the adhesive is able to spread out and make full contact with the adherent surface, resulting in a strong bond. The other options are not correct because rough surfaces, tangential alignment of molecules, or irregularities between adherent surfaces would not result in a zero degree angle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
