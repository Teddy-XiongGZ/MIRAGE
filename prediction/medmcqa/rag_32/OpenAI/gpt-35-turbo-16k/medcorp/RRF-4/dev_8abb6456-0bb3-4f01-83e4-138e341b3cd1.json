    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, tungsten carbide burs can have different rake angles depending on their design. The documents mention that higher cutting rates are associated with a longer bur lifespan, which suggests that the burs have a positive rake angle. However, the documents also mention that higher cutting rates are related to a longer bur lifespan, which suggests that the burs have a negative rake angle. Therefore, the answer is D. Both BC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
