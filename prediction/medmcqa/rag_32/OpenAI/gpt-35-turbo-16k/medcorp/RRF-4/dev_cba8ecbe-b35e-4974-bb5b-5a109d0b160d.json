    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Von Gierke's disease is characterized by a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, which leads to an inability to break down glycogen into glucose. This results in hypoglycemia, as glucose cannot be produced from glycogen. In response to hypoglycemia, the body starts to break down fatty acids for energy, leading to ketosis. Therefore, options A and B are correct. Option C is not directly related to ketosis in Von Gierke's disease. Option D is incorrect because low fat mobilization is not a reason responsible for ketosis in Von Gierke's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
