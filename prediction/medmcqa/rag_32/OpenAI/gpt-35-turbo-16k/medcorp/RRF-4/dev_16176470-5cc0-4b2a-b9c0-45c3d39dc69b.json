    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the muscles of mastication and their blood supply. Document [20] states that the temporalis muscle, one of the muscles of mastication, receives its blood supply from the deep temporal arteries which anastomose with the middle temporal artery. Document [16] mentions that the masseter muscle, another muscle of mastication, is innervated by the trigeminal nerve. However, there is no specific information about the blood supply of the other muscles of mastication in the provided documents. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine the exact blood supply of the muscles of mastication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information\"}"
