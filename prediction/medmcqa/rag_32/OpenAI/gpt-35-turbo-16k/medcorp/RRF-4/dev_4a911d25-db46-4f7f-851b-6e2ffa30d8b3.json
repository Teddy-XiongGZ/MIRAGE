    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the mechanical properties of bone indicate that it resists compression well. The documents mention that bone is much stronger in compression than in tension, and that cortical bone is very resistant to bending, torsion, and compression. Additionally, the documents discuss the hierarchical arrangement of collagen and mineral in bone tissue, which contributes to its fracture resistance. Therefore, the answer to the question is C. Collagen component.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
