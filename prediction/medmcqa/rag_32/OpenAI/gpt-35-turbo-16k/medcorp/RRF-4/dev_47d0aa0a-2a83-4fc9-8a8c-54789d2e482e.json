    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which drug is not useful for MRSA, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [11] states that to treat MRSA infections, clinicians should select an MRSA drug with proven in-vivo effectiveness, such as daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, or vancomycin. Document [16] also mentions that antibiotics effective against MRSA can be given by IV, oral, or a combination of both, and vancomycin is specifically mentioned as a treatment option. Therefore, the drug that is not useful for MRSA is A. Cefaclor, as it is not mentioned in the relevant documents as an effective treatment for MRSA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
