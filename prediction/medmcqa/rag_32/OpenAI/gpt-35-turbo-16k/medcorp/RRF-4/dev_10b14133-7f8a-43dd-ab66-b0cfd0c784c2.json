    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine in which stage of neurocysticercosis there is no edema, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Edema is mentioned in several documents as a common feature of neurocysticercosis. Document [0] states that corticosteroids can be used to reduce brain edema in the acute stages of neurocysticercosis. Document [2] describes the association between edema and contrast enhancement around calcified lesions. Document [12] mentions that cerebral edema can be seen in the initial stage of neurocysticercosis. Document [14] discusses the role of contrast-enhanced MRI in the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis and mentions that edema volume changes can be observed on follow-up MRI scans. Based on this information, it can be inferred that edema is present in the acute or initial stages of neurocysticercosis. Therefore, the stage of neurocysticercosis in which there is no edema is the nodular calcified stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
