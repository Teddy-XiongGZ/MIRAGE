    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the 10-year-old girl presents with a cystic and mobile mass in the lower abdomen involving the umbilical and hypogastrium regions. The examiner is unable to insinuate fingers between the mass and the pelvic bone. Considering these findings, the likely diagnosis is an omental cyst.
