    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the ligand for receptors present in the liver for uptake of LDL is Apo B-100. Document [24] states that the uptake of chylomicron remnants by rodent liver is mediated by proteins residing on the microvillous surface of hepatocytes and occurs through binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor via Apo E and to hepatic lipase via polar lipids and proteins on the remnant surface. Additionally, Document [26] mentions that the anti-LDL receptor antibody inhibited the binding and uptake of chylomicron remnants and LDL by hepatocytes, indicating that the LDL receptor is involved in the uptake of LDL. Since Apo B-100 is the primary apolipoprotein present on LDL particles, it can be concluded that Apo B-100 is the ligand for receptors present in the liver for uptake of LDL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Apo B-100\"}"
