    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"One of the mechanisms of adverse events is increased binding to secondary targets, usually proteins. To determine the characteristics of the secondary target with respect to the primary target, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions that many newly developed drugs are likely to have secondary molecular targets, which can cause adverse effects. Document [4] explains that on-target toxicity occurs when the adverse effect results from the drug's interaction with its intended target. Document [20] states that on-target side effects may be recognized when different types of agents with the same target have the same side effect. Based on this information, we can conclude that the secondary target should have similar binding sites to the primary target (B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
