    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In electrophoresis, charged particles move towards the pole opposite of their charge. Since lipoproteins are negatively charged, they will move towards the positive pole (anode). Therefore, the lipoprotein that does not move towards the charged end in electrophoresis is the one that is not negatively charged. Chylomicrons are the lipoproteins that are not negatively charged, as they contain the highest percentage of lipid and the lowest percentage of protein. Therefore, the answer is D. Chylomicrons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
