    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myosin head detachment from actin is triggered by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. This is because the myosin head first attaches to actin together with the products of ATP hydrolysis, performs a power stroke associated with the release of hydrolysis products, and then detaches from actin upon binding with new ATP. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
