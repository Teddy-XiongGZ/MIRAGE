    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Local anesthesia is a technique used to induce the absence of sensation in a specific part of the body. It can result in local analgesia, which is the loss of pain sensation. The question asks about the first sensation to be lost following administration of local anesthetic. Based on the information provided in the documents, local anesthetics block nerve impulse transmission in the peripheral and central nervous system without causing central nervous system depression or altered mental status. The block generally occurs in a stepwise sequence, with autonomic impulses blocked first, then sensory impulses, and finally motor impulses. Therefore, the first sensation to be lost following administration of local anesthetic is likely pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
