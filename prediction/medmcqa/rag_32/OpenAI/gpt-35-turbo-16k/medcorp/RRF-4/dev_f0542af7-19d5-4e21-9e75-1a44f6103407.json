    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is not a characteristic feature of Binder syndrome, we need to review the relevant documents and identify the features associated with Binder syndrome. Binder syndrome, also known as maxillonasal dysplasia, is a developmental disorder primarily affecting the anterior part of the maxilla and nasal complex. The characteristic features of Binder syndrome include midfacial hypoplasia, an underdeveloped midface, an abnormally short nose, a flat nasal bridge, and a retruded midface. Class III malocclusion, which is a condition where the lower jaw protrudes beyond the upper jaw, is commonly associated with Binder syndrome. Class II malocclusion, on the other hand, is a condition where the upper jaw protrudes beyond the lower jaw. Therefore, the feature that is not characteristic of Binder syndrome is Class II malocclusion. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
