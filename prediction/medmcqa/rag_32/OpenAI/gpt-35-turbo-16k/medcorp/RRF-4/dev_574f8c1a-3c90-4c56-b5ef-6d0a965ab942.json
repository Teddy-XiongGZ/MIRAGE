    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents mention several tests for neural tube defects, including ultrasound examination, measurement of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFAFP), and amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase (AFAChE) tests. The documents also mention that second trimester ultrasound is recommended as the primary screening tool for NTDs, and MSAFP as a secondary screening tool. The MSAFP test has a high false positive rate but is a good predictor of open neural tube defects. Based on this information, the best marker for neural tube defect is C. Alpha fetoprotein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
