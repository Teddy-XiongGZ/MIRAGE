    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tetanizing frequency can be calculated by adding the contraction time and relaxation time and taking the reciprocal of the sum. In this case, the sum of the contraction time and relaxation time is 40 ms + 50 ms = 90 ms. Taking the reciprocal of 90 ms gives a frequency of approximately 11.1 Hz. Since the options provided are in multiples of 25 Hz, the closest option is 25 Hz (Option A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
