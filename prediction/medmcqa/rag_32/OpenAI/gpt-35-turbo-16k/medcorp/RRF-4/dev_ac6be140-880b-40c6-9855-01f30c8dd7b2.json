    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In order to determine the source of calcium ions in a calcific bridge after calcium hydroxide pulpotomy, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [8] mentions that during the healing process after pulpotomy, there is a close contact between fibroblast-like cells/osteoblast-like cells and nerve terminals at the calcification front. This suggests that the calcium ions for the calcific bridge may come from the dentin-forming cells. Document [24] also supports this idea, stating that complete hard tissue bridges, which include calcific bridges, produce a satisfactory protection to the pulp. Therefore, the most likely source of calcium ions for the calcific bridge is the dentin-forming cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
