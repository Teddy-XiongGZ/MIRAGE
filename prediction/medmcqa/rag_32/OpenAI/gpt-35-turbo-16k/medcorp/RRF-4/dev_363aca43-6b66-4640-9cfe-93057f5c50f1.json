    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrates are known to have both coronary and non-coronary effects. In the context of acute attack of angina, the major mechanism of action of nitrates is to decrease preload. This is achieved by inducing venodilation, which reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart and subsequently decreases ventricular filling pressure. This reduction in preload leads to a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand and an improvement in the balance between oxygen supply and demand, providing relief from anginal symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decrease in preload\"}"
