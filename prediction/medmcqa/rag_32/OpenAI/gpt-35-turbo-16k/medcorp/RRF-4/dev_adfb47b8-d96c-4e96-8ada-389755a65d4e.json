    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At full term in pregnancy, several physiological changes occur. Minute volume, which is the amount of air breathed in one minute, increases due to the increased demand for oxygen. GFR (glomerular filtration rate), which is the rate at which the kidneys filter blood, also increases to accommodate the increased metabolic waste. Blood volume increases during pregnancy to support the growing fetus and provide adequate oxygen and nutrients. Cardiac output, which is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute, also increases to meet the increased demands of pregnancy. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above. None of these parameters decrease at full term in pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
