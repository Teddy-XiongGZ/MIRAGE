    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can gather information about the advantages and disadvantages of custom trays and stock trays for crown impressions. Custom trays are highly advocated for their accuracy and reliability in reproducing the prepared teeth and their relationship to the adjacent oral structures. They are designed to provide a uniform space for the impression material, resulting in better accuracy of the working cast. On the other hand, stock trays are less rigid and may not record the full flange accurately. They can also distort easily, leading to less accurate impressions. Custom trays require planning, study models, laboratory time, curing interval, and finishing time, which can make them more expensive compared to stock trays. However, stock trays are more cost-efficient in the long-term as they are reusable. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is C. Custom tray is cheaper.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
