    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the response to intravenous norepinephrine in a patient with septic shock. Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that is commonly used to increase blood pressure in septic shock. It works by constricting blood vessels and increasing systemic vascular resistance. Therefore, the response to norepinephrine would be an increase in mean arterial pressure (Choice C). Norepinephrine does not directly affect heart rate, so Choices A and B are incorrect. Additionally, norepinephrine is not expected to decrease renal perfusion or reduce urine output, so Choice D is also incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
