    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the 11-year-old child has a maxillary central incisor with a fracture at the apical third of the root. The tooth is vital and slightly mobile. The best treatment at this point of time would be to relieve the occlusion and splint the tooth. This will help stabilize the tooth and prevent further damage or displacement. Immediate root canal treatment may not be necessary if the pulp is still vital. Extracting the tooth should be avoided if possible, as preserving the natural tooth is generally preferred. Palliative therapy alone may not provide sufficient support for the fractured tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
