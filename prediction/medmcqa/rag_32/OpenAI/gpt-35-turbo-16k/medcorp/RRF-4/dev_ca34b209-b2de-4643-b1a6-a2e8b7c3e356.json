    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best method for observing an occluded submandibular salivary duct, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] states that sialolithiasis, or salivary stones, can obstruct the submandibular duct. Document [17] explains that the submandibular duct has two bends and a smaller orifice compared to the parotid duct, which can promote slowing and stasis of saliva, making obstruction and calcification more likely. Document [21] mentions that sialendoscopy is a minimally invasive technique used to diagnose and treat obstructions in the salivary ductal system. Based on this information, the best method for observing an occluded submandibular salivary duct would be sialography, which is a diagnostic procedure that involves injecting a contrast medium into the salivary ducts and taking X-ray images to visualize any obstructions or abnormalities. Therefore, the answer is B. Sialography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
