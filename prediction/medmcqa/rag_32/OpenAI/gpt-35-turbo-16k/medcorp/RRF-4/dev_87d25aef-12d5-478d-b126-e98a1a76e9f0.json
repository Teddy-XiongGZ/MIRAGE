    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which stage of Plasmodium vivax is infective to mosquitoes, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the mosquito stage of the parasite life cycle includes all stages of sexual reproduction, including infection and gametogenesis. Document [1] mentions that when an infected mosquito feeds on a human, thousands of sporozoites are inoculated into the human blood. Document [2] explains that malaria parasites are transmitted from the mosquito to the human host in the form of sporozoites during a blood meal. Document [3] mentions that Plasmodium sporozoites are the product of a complex developmental process in the mosquito vector and are destined to infect the mammalian liver. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the infective stage of Plasmodium vivax to mosquitoes is the sporozoite stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Sporozoite\"}"
