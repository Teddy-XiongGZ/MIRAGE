    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the anchoring fibres of the lamina densa contain Type 7 collagen. Document [1] mentions that anchoring filaments pass from the hemidesmosomes at the base of the epidermal cells across the basal lamina to the dermis. Document [8] also states that the lamina densa is separated from the plasma membrane of epithelial cells by a lamina lucida and that anchoring fibrils remain inserted into the lamina densa. Furthermore, Document [20] confirms that type VII collagen is a major structural component of anchoring fibrils found beneath the lamina densa. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Type 7 collagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
