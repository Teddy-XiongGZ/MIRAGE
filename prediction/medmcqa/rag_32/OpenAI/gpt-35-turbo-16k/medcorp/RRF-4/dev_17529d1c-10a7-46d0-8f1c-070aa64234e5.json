    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is not a characteristic feature of multiple myeloma, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow and paraprotein production are characteristic features of multiple myeloma. Document [8] mentions that patients with multiple myeloma have a clonal IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE myeloma protein in their serum and/or a clonal \u03ba or \u03bb light chain in their serum or urine. Document [16] states that multiple myeloma is often diagnosed when a monoclonal protein is found in the serum or urine. Based on this information, we can conclude that increased Ig levels in serum (choice A) is a characteristic feature of multiple myeloma. Therefore, the answer is B. Positive ANA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
