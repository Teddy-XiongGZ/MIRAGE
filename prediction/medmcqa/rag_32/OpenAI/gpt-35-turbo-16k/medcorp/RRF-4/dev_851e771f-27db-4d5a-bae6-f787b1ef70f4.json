    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the position of the apical foramen can vary. Document [3] states that the major location of both the root apex and the major foramen is in the center of the root. Document [6] mentions that the most frequent deviation of the major foramen is on the distal root surface. However, there is no specific measurement given for the distance between the apical foramen and the root apex. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact range of the offcenter position of the apical foramen based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information provided\"}"
