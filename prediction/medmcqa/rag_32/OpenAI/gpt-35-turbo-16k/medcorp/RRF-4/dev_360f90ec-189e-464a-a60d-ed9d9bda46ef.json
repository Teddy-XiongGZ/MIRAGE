    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the usual weight of rabbits used in ophthalmological experiments, we need to search for information about the weight of rabbits in the relevant documents. Document [8] mentions that rabbit eyes have been widely used for ophthalmic research as the size of a rabbit eye is similar to that of a human eye. However, it does not provide specific information about the weight of rabbits used in experiments. Document [15] discusses the performance of a new aqueous shunt in normal rabbit eyes, but it does not mention the weight of the rabbits. Document [18] mentions the examination of the eye in experiments designed to test the toxicity of drugs or chemicals, but it does not provide information about the weight of the rabbits used. Document [25] discusses a pilot study on inducing photoreceptor degeneration in rabbit eyes, but it does not mention the weight of the rabbits. None of the other documents provide relevant information about the weight of rabbits used in ophthalmological experiments. Based on the available information, we cannot determine the usual weight of rabbits used in ophthalmological experiments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
