    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the commonly used drug in the treatment for cancer-associated thromboembolism, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the low molecular weight heparin nadroparin has been evaluated in a study and shown to reduce the rate of thromboembolic events in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Document [1] also mentions that low-molecular-weight heparin remains the best treatment option for initial and long-term treatment of VTE in cancer patients. Document [3] supports this by stating that low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are the backbone of the treatment of cancer-associated thromboembolism. Based on this information, the commonly used drug in the treatment for cancer-associated thromboembolism is low molecular weight heparin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
