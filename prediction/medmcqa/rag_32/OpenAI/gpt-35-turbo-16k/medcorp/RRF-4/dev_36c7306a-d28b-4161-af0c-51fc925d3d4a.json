    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tooth eruption is a complex process and there have been many theories proposed over time. According to the relevant documents, the most widely held current theory is that the periodontal ligament provides the main impetus for tooth eruption. The periodontal ligament promotes eruption through the shrinking and cross-linking of their collagen fibers and the contraction of their fibroblasts. Therefore, the answer is not A (osteoclastic activity) or B (proliferation of cells at crypt). Exfoliation of primary tooth (C) refers to the shedding of primary teeth, which is a separate process from tooth eruption. The most plausible answer is D (eruptive forces), as the periodontal ligament is responsible for generating the forces that drive tooth eruption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
