    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 95% confidence interval in clinical trials is used to check for both efficacy and non-efficacy of the drug. The confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true effect of the drug is likely to fall. If the confidence interval includes zero, it suggests that the drug may not be significantly different from placebo, indicating non-efficacy. On the other hand, if the confidence interval does not include zero, it suggests that the drug is significantly different from placebo, indicating efficacy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
