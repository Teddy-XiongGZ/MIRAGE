    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus is primarily due to the elaboration of an enzyme that destroys penicillin. This enzyme, known as penicillinase or beta-lactamase, cleaves the beta-lactam ring of the penicillin molecule, rendering it ineffective. This mechanism of resistance is well-documented in the documents, particularly in Document [3] and Document [8]. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Elaboration of an enzyme that destroys penicillin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
