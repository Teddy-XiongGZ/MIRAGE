    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), bleeding can occur due to the consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. To reveal bleeding in DIC, the best laboratory investigation would be to measure the levels of Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs). Increased levels of FDPs indicate the breakdown of fibrin clots and the activation of the fibrinolytic system, which is associated with bleeding. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased FDPs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
