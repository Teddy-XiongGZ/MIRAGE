    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MHC Class II proteins are expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as B-cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Platelets do not express MHC Class II proteins. T-cells do not express MHC Class II proteins either, they express MHC Class I proteins. All nucleated cells express MHC Class I proteins, not MHC Class II proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
