    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To reduce the chances of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR), the blood should undergo leucocyte reduction. This is supported by multiple documents that mention the effectiveness of leucocyte reduction in reducing the incidence of FNHTRs. Document [0] states that adopting a policy of universal leucodepletion can minimize or eliminate FNHTRs. Document [2] mentions that leucocyte reduction is important in preventing FNHTRs. Document [10] also highlights that leucoreduction of RBC or platelets significantly reduces complications of FNHTRs. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Leucocyte reduction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
