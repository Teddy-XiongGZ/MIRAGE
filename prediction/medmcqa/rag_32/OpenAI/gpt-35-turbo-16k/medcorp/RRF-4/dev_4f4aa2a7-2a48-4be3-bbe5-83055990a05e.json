    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adeno ameloblastoma is a variant of ameloblastoma that exhibits aggressive behavior and a high likelihood of recurrence. The treatment of choice for ameloblastoma, including adeno ameloblastoma, is aggressive en bloc resection with simultaneous reconstruction. This involves removing the entire tumor with a wide margin of surrounding tissue. Enbloc resection of the maxilla is a surgical technique that may be used for larger ameloblastomas involving the maxilla. Marsupialization and enucleation are not recommended for adeno ameloblastoma due to the high recurrence rate associated with these treatment modalities. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
