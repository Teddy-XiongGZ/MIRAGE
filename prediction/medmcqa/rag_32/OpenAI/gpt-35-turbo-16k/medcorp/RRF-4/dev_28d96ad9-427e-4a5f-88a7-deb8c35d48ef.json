    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To compare the mean peak flow of expiratory rates between different groups (non-smokers, light smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers), we need to use a statistical test that can compare means across multiple groups. The appropriate test for this scenario is the one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). The one-way ANOVA is used to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups. In this case, we have four groups (non-smokers, light smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers), so the one-way ANOVA is the most suitable test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
