    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the presence of glucose in urine. Document [0] states that glucose does not appear in urine until the renal threshold for glucose has been exceeded. Document [1] also mentions that the renal reabsorption threshold for glucose is between 160-180 mg/dl. Document [11] confirms that glycosuria (presence of glucose in urine) is nearly always caused by elevated blood glucose levels, most commonly due to untreated diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Renal threshold for glucose is exceeded.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
