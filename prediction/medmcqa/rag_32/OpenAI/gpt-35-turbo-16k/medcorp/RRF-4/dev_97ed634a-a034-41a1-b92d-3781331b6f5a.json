    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the sinus that grows till early adulthood by analyzing the growth patterns of each sinus. Document [0] states that the maxillary sinus in infants and during early and first childhood periods of human ontogenesis undergoes changes in both quantitative and qualitative nature. Document [4] further supports this by stating that the height of the maxillary sinus has steady growth from birth to at least the age of 18 years. On the other hand, document [2] mentions that the ethmoid sinus is fully aerated by the age of seven, indicating that its growth is complete by that age. Document [3] provides information on the growth rate of the frontal sinuses, stating that the frontal sinuses of girls increase evenly in size during the years, while the growth rate of male frontal sinuses is very low from 8-12 years, causing a retardation of growth in boys compared to girls. Finally, document [5] focuses on the growth dynamics of the sphenoidal sinus and its formation from the age of 1 year till 3-5 years. Based on this information, we can conclude that the sinus that grows till early adulthood is the: \", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Frontal\"}"
