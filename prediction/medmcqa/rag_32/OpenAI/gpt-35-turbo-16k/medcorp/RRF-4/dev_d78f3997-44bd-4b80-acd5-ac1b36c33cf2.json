    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there is no specific consensus on the exact fixation period for intrusive luxation injuries. Different treatment approaches and fixation periods have been suggested depending on the severity of the injury and the individual case. However, Document [4] mentions that in a case of severe intrusive luxation, the teeth were repositioned successfully by endodontic and orthodontic management, and the splint was removed 2 months later. Document [6] also mentions a case where the intruded tooth was immediately repositioned surgically and splinted within hours following the injury, and the splint was removed 2 months later. Therefore, based on these cases, it can be inferred that the fixation period for intrusive luxation injuries may be around 2 months. However, it is important to note that the exact fixation period may vary depending on the specific case and the severity of the injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 4 weeks with semi rigid and 2 week with rigid\"}"
