    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resolving power of a microscope refers to its ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects. It depends on various factors such as the size of the aperture, focal length of the eyepiece, thickness of the film, and wavelength of the light source used. To answer the question, we need to identify the factor that does not affect the resolving power. The size of the aperture affects the numerical aperture and the amount of light entering the microscope, which in turn affects the resolving power. The focal length of the eyepiece affects the magnification but does not directly impact the resolving power. The thickness of the film refers to the specimen thickness, which can affect the resolving power. Finally, the wavelength of the light source used is a crucial factor that directly affects the resolving power. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Focal length of the eyepiece.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
