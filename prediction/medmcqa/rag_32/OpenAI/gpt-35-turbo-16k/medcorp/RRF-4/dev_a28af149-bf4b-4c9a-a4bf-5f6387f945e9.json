    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the preferred IV cannula for a young patient who needs to be transfused with large amounts of fluids, we need to consider the relevant documents. Document [4] states that for blood transfusion, an 18 gauge or larger IV access is preferred. Document [5] mentions that in adults, IV cannulas ranging from 18G to 22G are normally used. Document [10] provides information about the optimal diameter for transfusion, which is 16 to 18G. Based on this information, the preferred IV cannula for the young patient would be an 18 gauge (18G) cannula. Therefore, the answer is D. Pink.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
