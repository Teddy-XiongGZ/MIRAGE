    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common gene defect in idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome, we need to analyze the relevant documents for information on gene mutations associated with this condition. Document [1] mentions that more than 30 monogenic genes have been identified to cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, and NPHS2 is one of the genes implicated. Document [8] also states that mutations in NPHS2 are responsible for autosomal recessive familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which is a form of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, based on the information from these documents, the most common gene defect in idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome is NPHS2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
