    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following doesn't have any effect on pancreatic secretion, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that pancreatic polypeptide inhibits pancreatic secretion stimulated by cholecystokinin (CCK). Document [12] mentions that secretin primarily functions to neutralize the pH in the duodenum, allowing digestive enzymes from the pancreas to function optimally. Document [26] states that bile and bile salts have no or even an inhibitory effect on pancreatic secretion stimulated by intraluminal nutrients. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is D. Gastric inhibitory polypeptide, as it is not mentioned in any of the documents as having an effect on pancreatic secretion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
