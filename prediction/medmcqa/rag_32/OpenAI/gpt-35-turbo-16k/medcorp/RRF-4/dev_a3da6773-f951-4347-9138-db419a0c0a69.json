    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the tumor marker for seminoma, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [10] states that serum tumor marker levels, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), are measured in patients with suspected testicular mass. Document [9] mentions that a classical or pure seminoma does not cause an elevated serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Document [3] states that the lack of frequent tumor markers in the sera of patients with seminoma prompted a study on biochemical tumor markers, including placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma GT), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). It was found that 80% of patients with clinically active tumors had detectable serum levels of one or more of these biochemical markers. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. HCG, as it is mentioned in multiple documents as a tumor marker for seminoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
