    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the answer, we need to find information about achieving balance in hand instruments. Looking through the relevant documents, we can see that Document [5] titled 'Periodontal scaler' discusses the factors to consider with the design of periodontal scalers, including balance. According to the document, proper alignment of the working ends to the long axis of the instrument handle allows for effective application of finger pressure and reduces muscle fatigue. However, the document does not provide specific measurements for the distance between the blade edge and the axis of the handle or shank. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact measurement for achieving balance in hand instruments from the given documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
