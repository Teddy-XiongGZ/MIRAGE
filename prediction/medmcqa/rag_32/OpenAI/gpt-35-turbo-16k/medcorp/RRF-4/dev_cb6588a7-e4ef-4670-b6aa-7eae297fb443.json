    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the exact number of weeks between the last menstrual period and the expected date of delivery, we can use Naegele's rule. According to Naegele's rule, we add 7 days and 9 calendar months to the date of the last menstrual period. In this case, the last menstrual period is in March 2005. Adding 7 days and 9 calendar months to March 2005 gives us December 2005. Therefore, the expected date of delivery is in December 2005. To calculate the number of weeks, we can count the number of weeks between March 2005 and December 2005. Counting the weeks, we find that there are 39 weeks between the last menstrual period and the expected date of delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 39 weeks\"}"
