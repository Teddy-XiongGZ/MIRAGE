    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes play a crucial role in calcification processes. To determine which enzymes are involved, we can refer to the provided documents. Document [1] mentions that alkaline phosphatase is an important enzyme in the mineralization process. Document [3] also mentions the involvement of alkaline phosphatase in calcification. Additionally, document [10] discusses the role of acid and alkaline phosphatases in the precipitation of calcium salts in tissues. Pyrophosphatase is mentioned in document [5] as an important calcification inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase is mentioned in document [0] as being involved in calcification processes in human tissues, but its precise role in calcification is not specified. Based on this information, the enzymes that play an important role in calcification are alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase\"}"
