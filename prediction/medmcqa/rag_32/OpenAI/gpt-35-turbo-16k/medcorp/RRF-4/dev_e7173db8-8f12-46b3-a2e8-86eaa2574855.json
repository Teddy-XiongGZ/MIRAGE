    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The boy has a short PR interval and a delta wave on the ECG, which are characteristic findings of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. WPW syndrome is a condition characterized by an accessory pathway that bypasses the normal electrical conduction system of the heart, leading to a shortened PR interval and a delta wave on the ECG. The most effective treatment for WPW syndrome is catheter ablation of the accessory pathway. However, in an asymptomatic patient, the risk of sudden cardiac death is low, and the benefit of catheter ablation may not outweigh the risks. Therefore, the least effective measure for the boy would be reassurance, as it does not address the underlying abnormality and does not provide any treatment or management for the condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
