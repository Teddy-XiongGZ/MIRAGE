    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the effect of radiation. To determine the answer, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [4] states that most adverse health effects of radiation exposure may be grouped into two general categories: deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) and stochastic effects (cancer and heritable effects). Document [18] further explains that deterministic effects are harmful tissue reactions due to the killing/malfunction of cells following high doses, while stochastic effects are cancer and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals or heritable disease in their offspring. Based on this information, the effect of radiation is not cumulative, fractionalized, or concentrated. It is dependent on the genetic make-up of individuals, as stated in option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
