    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine the answer by analyzing the descriptions of Korff fibers. Document [0] states that no evidence was found for the presence of collagenous von Korff fibers in mantle dentine. Document [1] confirms the collagenous nature of von Korff fibers in early dentinogenesis. Document [2] describes Korff fibers as thick collagenous fibers that form the matrix of dentin. Document [4] re-examines the existence and significance of Von Korff fibers during dentinogenesis. Document [10] provides immunohistochemical observations that demonstrate the presence of interodontoblastic fibers (IOF) during root circumpulpal dentin formation, which have a similar distribution pattern to the classical von Korff fibers. Based on this information, the answer is A. Mantle dentin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
