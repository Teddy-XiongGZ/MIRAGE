    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed by the reaction of calcium hydroxide with phosphoric acid. The reaction can be represented as Ca(OH)2 + H3PO4 -> Ca(H2PO4)2.H2O. To determine the percentage of phosphoric acid where dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed that cannot be rinsed off, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction. From the balanced equation, we can see that for every 1 mole of calcium hydroxide, we need 2 moles of phosphoric acid to form 1 mole of dicalcium phosphate monohydrate. This means that the molar ratio of phosphoric acid to dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is 2:1. Therefore, the percentage of phosphoric acid where dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed that cannot be rinsed off is 50%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
