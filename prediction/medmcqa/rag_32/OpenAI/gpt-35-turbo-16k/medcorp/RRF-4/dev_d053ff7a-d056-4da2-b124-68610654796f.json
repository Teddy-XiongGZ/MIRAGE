    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Depression of the mandible refers to the downward movement of the lower jaw. To determine the muscles involved in this movement, we can refer to the relevant documents. Document [12] states that depression of the mandible is generated by the digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles on both sides. Document [8] also mentions that the depression of the lower jaw (mandible) is achieved by the lateral pterygoid muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above, as all three muscles (digastric, lateral pterygoid, and geniohyoid) contribute to the depression of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
