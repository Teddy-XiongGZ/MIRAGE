    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, we can determine the answer by analyzing the content. Document [0] discusses the use of a modified Gillies approach for zygomatic arch fracture reduction in the setting of bicoronal exposure. Document [6] also mentions the Gillies temporal approach for fractures of the zygoma. Therefore, the Gillies approach is used in the open reduction of zygomatic fractures. Hence, the correct answer is A. Open reduction of zygomatic fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
