    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the firing process and its effects on shrinkage in ceramics. Document [1] explains that during the firing or sintering process, there is a gradual elimination of porosity, which is typically accompanied by a net shrinkage and overall densification of the ceramic component. Document [2] mentions that during the initial firing process, a large amount of shrinkage occurs until the ceramic mass reaches an almost void-free state. Document [3] also discusses the linear sintering shrinkage rate of ceramic during the firing stage. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the maximum shrinkage during the firing process in ceramics occurs in the Fusion stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
