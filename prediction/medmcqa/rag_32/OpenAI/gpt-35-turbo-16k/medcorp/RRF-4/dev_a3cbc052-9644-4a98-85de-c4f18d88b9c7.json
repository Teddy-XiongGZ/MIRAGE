    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant information can be found in Document [3] and Document [7]. Document [3] states that the Klenow fragment retains the 5' \u2192 3' polymerase activity and the 3\u2019 \u2192 5\u2019 exonuclease activity, but loses its 5' \u2192 3' exonuclease activity. Document [7] confirms that the Klenow fragment has both DNA polymerase and 3'-5'-exonuclease activities. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 3'- 5' exonuclease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
