    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's blood culture shows growth of Gram +ve cocci which are catalase positive and coagulase negative. Based on this information, the most likely etiological agent is Staph. epidermidis. Staph. aureus is catalase positive and coagulase positive, so it is not the correct answer. Streptococcus pyogenes is catalase negative, so it is also not the correct answer. Enterococcus faecalis is catalase negative and coagulase negative, but it is not a Gram +ve cocci. Therefore, the most likely etiological agent is Staph. epidermidis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Staph. epidermidis\"}"
