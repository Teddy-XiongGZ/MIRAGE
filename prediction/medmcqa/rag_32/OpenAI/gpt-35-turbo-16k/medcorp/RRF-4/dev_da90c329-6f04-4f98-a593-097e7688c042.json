    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the facial proportions between the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the face, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [8] provides information about the ideal facial relationship. According to this document, the ideal facial relationship is where the upper jaw lies 2-4mm in front of the lower jaw, which suggests that the upper third of the face is slightly shorter than the lower third. However, this document does not provide specific numerical proportions. Document [18] also mentions the vertical dimensions of the face and the ideal facial aesthetics showing equality between each vertical third. However, it does not provide specific numerical proportions either. Document [29] discusses the facial soft tissue proportion in the local population and mentions that the three sections of the facial profile are not equal. Based on the available information, it is difficult to determine the exact facial proportions between the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the face. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
