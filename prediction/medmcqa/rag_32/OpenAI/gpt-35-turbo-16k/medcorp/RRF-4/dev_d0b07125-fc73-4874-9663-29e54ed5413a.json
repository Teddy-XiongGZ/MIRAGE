    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the correct statement regarding ASO titre. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. ASO can be increased in school children: This statement is supported by Document [30], which states that ASO titers of school children were studied and the upper limit of normal ASO titer varied annually.\\n\\nB. May be negative in post streptococcal glomerulonephritis: This statement is supported by Document [19], which mentions that ASO titers can be negative even after streptococcal pharyngitis, and Document [28], which states that antibodies against streptokinase (ASK), streptolysin O (ASO), and deoxyribonuclease B (ADNaseB) alone may not be reliable markers of acute streptococcal infection.\\n\\nC. ASO titre included in major criteria in jones criteria: This statement is not supported by any of the provided documents.\\n\\nD. May not be elevated in 20% cases of carditis: This statement is supported by Document [29], which states that in the diagnosis of acute and post-streptococcal disease, a single antibody titre may not be reliable, and Document [28], which mentions that a combination of ASO and ADNaseB is required to achieve maximum sensitivity and specificity in identifying post-streptococcal disease.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct statement regarding ASO titre is that it may not be elevated in 20% cases of carditis. Therefore, the answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
