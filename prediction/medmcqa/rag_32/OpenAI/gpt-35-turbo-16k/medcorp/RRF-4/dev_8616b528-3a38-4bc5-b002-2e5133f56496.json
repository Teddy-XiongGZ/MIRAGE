    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described (rotatory vertigo and nausea in the morning on change in position of the head), the most likely diagnosis is BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo). BPPV is characterized by brief episodes of vertigo triggered by specific head movements, such as rolling over in bed or looking up. It is commonly associated with nausea and can be diagnosed with a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Labyrinthitis, vestibular neuronitis, and Meniere's disease may present with similar symptoms but do not typically have a specific positional trigger like BPPV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
