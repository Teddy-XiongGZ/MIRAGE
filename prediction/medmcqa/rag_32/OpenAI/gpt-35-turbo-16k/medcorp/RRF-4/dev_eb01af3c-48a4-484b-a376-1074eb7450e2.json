    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"HCN channels are primarily involved in cardiac rhythm generation. They control spontaneous electrical activity in the heart and brain, and their activation contributes to the generation of pacemaker potentials in cardiac cells. The relevant documents mention the role of HCN channels in controlling cardiac rhythmicity, heart rate modulation, and pacemaker currents. There is no mention of HCN channels being involved in the generation of mitochondrial action potential, myocardial muscle contraction, or memory formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
