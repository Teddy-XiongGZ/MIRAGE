Document [4] mentions that in an acute setting requiring rapid infusion of crystalloid fluids, larger bore intravenous cannulas should be used to ensure the safe administration of high fluid volumes. It suggests using large-bore peripheral lines (18-gauge or larger) or central access. However, there is no specific mention of the color of the cannula. Therefore, the color of the intravenous cannula is not specified in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not specified\"}"
