    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of pulp proper. To answer this, we need to refer to the relevant documents that provide information about the structure and composition of dental pulp. Document [2] states that the pulp is made up of living connective tissues and odontoblasts. Document [15] describes the pulp as having four zones: the odontoblastic layer, mesenchymal zone, cell-rich zone, and the core. Document [20] mentions that the pulp contains fibroblasts, odontoblasts, and defense cells like histiocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, mast cells, and plasma cells. Based on this information, we can conclude that the pulp proper resembles a combination of loose connective tissue, fine nerve fibers, and blood vessels, as well as multipotent cells. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
