    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can determine the true statement about the nerve supply of the adrenal gland. 1. Document [1] states that the arterial supply of the adrenal glands consists of small arterial branches arising from the inferior phrenic artery, the aorta, and the renal arteries. It does not provide information about the nerve supply. 2. Document [5] mentions that the adrenal medulla is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5\u2013T11. This indicates that the adrenal medulla does have nerve supply from the sympathetic nervous system. 3. Document [10] also confirms that the adrenal medulla is innervated by the splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system, which stimulate the release of catecholamines. 4. Document [28] provides further evidence of the sympathetic innervation of the adrenal medulla, stating that preganglionic cell bodies are located in the intermediolateral horn of the spinal cord at segments T1 and L1, and postganglionic cell bodies are found in the sympathetic ganglia at levels T4 and T12, as well as in the suprarenal ganglion. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is B. Preganglionic fibers from lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae come from the sympathetic chain to supply the adrenals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
