Document [0] mentions that leptin, a hormone produced by adipose cells, plays a permissive role in the resurgence of GnRH secretion at the onset of puberty. Document [1] also discusses the role of leptin in coordinating the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis and suggests that leptin may have a permissive but key role in the onset of puberty. Based on this information, the hormone that has a permissive action at the onset of puberty is B. Leptin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
