    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, guiding planes on abutment teeth provide increased resistance towards horizontal movement. This is supported by Document [0], which states that the presence of guide planes significantly increases the retention force of removable partial dentures. Document [3] also mentions the importance of preparing suitable guiding planes on abutment teeth during the fabrication of removable partial dentures to achieve parallelism and reduce abutment mobility. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increased resistance towards horizontal movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
