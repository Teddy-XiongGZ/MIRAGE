    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stiffness is a term used to describe the force needed to achieve a certain deformation of a structure. It is the extent to which an object resists deformation in response to an applied force. Stiffness is a measure of the resistance offered by an elastic body to deformation. It is not related to plastic deformation, which is a permanent deformation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Resistance to elastic deformation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
