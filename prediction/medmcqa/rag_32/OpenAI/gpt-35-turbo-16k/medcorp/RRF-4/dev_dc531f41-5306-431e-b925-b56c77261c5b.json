    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the vascular supply of the periodontal ligament. Document [1] states that the periodontal ligament contains blood vessels that connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Document [3] mentions that the periodontal ligament is composed mostly of collagen fibers and houses blood vessels and nerves. Document [4] describes the main principal fiber group of the periodontal ligament, the alveolodental ligament, which consists of five fiber subgroups. Document [7] discusses the microcirculation of the periodontal ligament and its role in protecting the periodontal tissue. Based on this information, we can conclude that the vascular supply of the periodontal ligament is a net-like plexus that runs closer to the bone than to the cementum. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
