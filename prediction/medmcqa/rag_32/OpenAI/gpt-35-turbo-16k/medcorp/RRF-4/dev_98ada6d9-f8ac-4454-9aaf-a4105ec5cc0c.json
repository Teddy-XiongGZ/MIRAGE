    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, mandibular fractures can be classified as favorable or unfavorable depending on the direction of the fracture line and the effect of muscle forces on the fracture fragments. In favorable fractures, the muscle forces tend to draw the fracture fragments together, while in unfavorable fractures, the muscle forces displace the fracture fragments. The question asks about loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture. According to the information in the documents, the angle and posterior body fractures have high positive bending moments, which means that compression is applied at the lower border and tension is applied at the alveolar side of the mandible. Therefore, the answer choice is A. Tension on upper border.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
