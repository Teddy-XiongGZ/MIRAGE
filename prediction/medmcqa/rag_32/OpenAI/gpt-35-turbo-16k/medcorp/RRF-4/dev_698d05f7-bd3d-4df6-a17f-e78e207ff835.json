    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which induction anaesthetic agent has antiemetic effect, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [2] states that propofol, when compared to thiopentone for induction of anaesthesia, resulted in an 18% reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
