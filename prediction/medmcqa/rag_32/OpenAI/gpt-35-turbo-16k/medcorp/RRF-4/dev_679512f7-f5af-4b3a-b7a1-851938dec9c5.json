    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent cross-infection with the sensor in digital radiography/RVG, the most effective method is to cover the sensor with an impervious barrier. This barrier acts as a protective layer, preventing direct contact between the sensor and the patient's saliva or blood, which may contain infectious agents. Autoclaved cloth, wiping with ethyl alcohol, and cleaning with sodium hypochlorite may help with disinfection, but they do not provide a physical barrier to prevent cross-infection. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Cover with impervious barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
