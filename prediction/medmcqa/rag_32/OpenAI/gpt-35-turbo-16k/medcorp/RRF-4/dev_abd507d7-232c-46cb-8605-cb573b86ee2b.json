    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document that provides information about study models with mounted base and trimmed height is Document [12]. This document discusses the mathematical modeling of molar tooth preparations for complete crowns. It mentions that the vertical heights of the models in the study were assigned to be 3 and 4mm, and the horizontal base width chosen to be 9 and 10mm. However, the document does not explicitly state the trimmed height of the study model. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine the exact trimmed height of the study model.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
