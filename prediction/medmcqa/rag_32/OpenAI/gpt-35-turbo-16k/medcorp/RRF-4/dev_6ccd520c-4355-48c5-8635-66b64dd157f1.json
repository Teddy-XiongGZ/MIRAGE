    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the assessment and measurement of anteroposterior jaw relationship. Document [0] mentions the AF-BF distance as the absolute measurement of the anteroposterior jaw relationship. Document [1] discusses the FH to AB plane angle (FABA) as a reliable cephalometric measurement of the anteroposterior relationship of the jaws. Document [2] mentions the use of occlusal (Wits appraisal) and palatal planes as reference lines to assess the linear anteroposterior jaw relation. None of the documents specifically mention the ANB angle, the angle between SN & FH Plane, or the facial angle as measurements for anteroposterior jaw relationship. Therefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is not mentioned in the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
