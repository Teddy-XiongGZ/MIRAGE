It is characterized by long, thin vertical striations of calcified spicules perpendicular to the bone surface, resembling hair standing on end. Fibrous dysplasia, Garre's osteomyelitis, and Paget's disease do not typically present with the \"hair-on-end\" appearance on skull roentgenograms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Thalassemia\"}"
