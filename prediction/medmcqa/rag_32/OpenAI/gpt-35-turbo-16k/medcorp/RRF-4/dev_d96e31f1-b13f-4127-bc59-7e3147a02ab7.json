    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the technique of root coverage, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. The documents mention various techniques for root coverage, such as connective tissue graft, envelope technique, coronally advanced flap, subepithelial connective tissue graft, double papilla preservation flap, and tunneling technique. However, none of the documents specifically mention the techniques listed in the answer choices (Langer and langer technique, Pouch and tunnel technique, Azis technique, Bruno technique). Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the correct technique of root coverage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
