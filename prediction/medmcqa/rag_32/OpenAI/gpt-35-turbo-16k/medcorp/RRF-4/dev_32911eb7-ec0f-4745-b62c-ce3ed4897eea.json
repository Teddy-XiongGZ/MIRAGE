    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is not a monomeric intermediate filament, we need to understand the definition of a monomeric intermediate filament. Monomeric intermediate filaments are single subunits that can polymerize to form the filament structure. From the provided documents, we can see that vimentin, keratin, and desmin are all mentioned as subunit proteins of intermediate filaments. However, tubulin is not mentioned as a subunit protein of intermediate filaments. Therefore, the answer is D. Tubulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
