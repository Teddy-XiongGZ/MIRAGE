    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 26-year-old female with mild pain in the lower abdomen and a palpable mass in the adnexa on pelvic examination. The USG pelvis shows a 5 cm ovarian cyst. The next step would be to consider the management options for an ovarian cyst. In this case, since the patient is asymptomatic and the cyst is small (5 cm), observation and follow-up after 2-3 months would be the most appropriate initial step. This is because most ovarian cysts in premenopausal women are functional cysts that resolve on their own within a few menstrual cycles. If the cyst persists or increases in size, further evaluation and management can be considered.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
