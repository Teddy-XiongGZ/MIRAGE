    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the film thickness of luting cement can vary depending on the specific type of cement and the clinical situation. Document [0] mentions that low film thickness is critical to the clinical success of cemented castings, and the study investigated the effect of luting agent-metal physico-chemical surface interactions on film thicknesses of representative luting agents. Document [1] states that all of the materials tested meet the ISO standard of 25-microm maximum film thickness for up to 2 minutes after mixing. Document [6] mentions that nine materials satisfied the ADA type I specification for film thicknesses less than 25 microns. Document [14] states that the film thickness of luting cement can vary depending on the specific material used, with some resinous cements recording film thicknesses greater than 40 microns. Based on this information, the most accurate answer choice is A. 20-40 \u03bc.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
