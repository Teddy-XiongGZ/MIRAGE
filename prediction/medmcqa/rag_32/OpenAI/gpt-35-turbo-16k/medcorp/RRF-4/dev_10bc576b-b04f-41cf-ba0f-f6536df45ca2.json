    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the safest and most efficacious solvent for dissolving Gutta Percha, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that chloroform and trichloroethylene had similar dissolving times for gutta-percha at different temperatures. Document [2] mentions that chloroform, xylene, and halothane are almost equally efficient solvents for gutta-percha removal. Document [4] also states that halothane, chloroform, and xylene were markedly superior solvents for dissolving gutta-percha compared to other solvents. Document [7] suggests that Hemo-De, a xylene substitute, dissolved gutta-percha in a range similar to xylene. Based on this information, it can be concluded that xylene is a safe and efficacious solvent for dissolving Gutta Percha.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Xylene\"}"
