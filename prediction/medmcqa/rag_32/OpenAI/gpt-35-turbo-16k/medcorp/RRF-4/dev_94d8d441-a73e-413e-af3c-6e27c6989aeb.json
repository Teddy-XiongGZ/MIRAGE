    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cells are of endodermal origin, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the endoderm develops into the interior linings of the digestive and respiratory tubes, including the epithelial lining of the intestine. Document [5] also confirms that the endoderm forms the epithelial lining of the whole digestive tract, including the intestine. Therefore, epithelial cells of the intestine are of endodermal origin. Document [13] mentions that the pancreas is an organ of endodermal origin, and hepatocytes are cells of the liver. However, there is no specific mention of odontoblasts or goblet cells in the provided documents. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine whether odontoblasts or goblet cells are of endodermal origin. Based on the information provided, the answer is D. Hepatocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
