    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the setting time of zinc phosphate cement can be retarded by increasing the addition of powder to liquid. This is mentioned in Document [9], which states that when the mixing time is long, the setting time is prolonged. It also mentions that compressive strength appears to be highest at a 90-second mixing time, indicating that increasing the mixing time can affect the setting time. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increase the addition of powder to liquid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
