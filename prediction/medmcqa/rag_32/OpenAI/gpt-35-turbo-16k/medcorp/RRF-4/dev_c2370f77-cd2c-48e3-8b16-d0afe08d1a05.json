    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inter-arch distance measured when the occlusal rims are in uniform contact is called the Vertical dimension of occlusion. This measurement is taken when the patient's teeth are in maximum intercuspation, which is the position where the cusps of the upper and lower teeth fully interpose themselves with the cusps of the opposing arch. This position is also known as centric occlusion or maximum intercuspation. The vertical dimension of occlusion is an important consideration in evaluating a patient orthodontically and restoring them prosthodontically.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
