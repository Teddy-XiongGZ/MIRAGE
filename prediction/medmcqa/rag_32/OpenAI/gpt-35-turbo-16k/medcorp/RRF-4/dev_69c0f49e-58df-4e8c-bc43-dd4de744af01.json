    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the probable reasons for a high incidence of dental caries in the teenage population, we can analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that fear of pain and anxiety about treatment can contribute to high rates of unmet dental care needs among teenagers. Document [4] mentions that over 85% of dental caries lesions in the permanent dentition involve surfaces with pits and fissures, despite the availability of preventive measures such as sealants. Document [6] highlights that untreated dental caries is more common in individuals with lower socioeconomic status.
