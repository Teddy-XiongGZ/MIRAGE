    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The amount of energy actually producing cutting refers to the energy that is used specifically for the cutting process. This can be measured by the cutting efficiency, which is the ratio of the useful energy output (in this case, the energy used for cutting) to the total energy input. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Cutting efficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
