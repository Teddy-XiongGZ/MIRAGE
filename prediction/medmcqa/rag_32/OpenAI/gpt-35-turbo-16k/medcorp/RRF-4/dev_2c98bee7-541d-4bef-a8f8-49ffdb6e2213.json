    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the normal WBC count, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] provides information on the reference values for WBC counts in the general Japanese population. It states that the 95% lower limit of the reference value for the population is 3 \u00d7 10^3 WBCs/mm^3. However, this information is specific to the Japanese population and may not be applicable to other populations. Document [7] mentions that the reference ranges for the complete blood count, including the WBC count, vary with gender and age. It states that the results found in 95% of apparently healthy people are used as reference ranges. Unfortunately, the specific reference range for the normal WBC count is not mentioned in this document. Based on the available information, it is difficult to determine the exact normal WBC count. However, the most commonly accepted range for the normal WBC count is 4,000-11,000 cells/mm^3. Therefore, the answer choice is A. 4,000-11,000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
