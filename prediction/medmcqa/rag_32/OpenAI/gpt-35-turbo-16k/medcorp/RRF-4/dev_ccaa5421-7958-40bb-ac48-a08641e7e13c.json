Document [2] states that the Oncotype DX test can predict the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers. Document [3] mentions that the Oncotype DX gene assay testing helps to select those patients who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Document [6] states that the Oncotype DX test is used to determine the need for systemic treatment, including chemotherapy, in patients with ER-positive, node-negative breast cancer. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the Oncotype DX test is done to guide chemotherapy recommendations in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. Therefore, the answer is A.
