    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the answer, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [3] states that pulpectomy is the last means to preserve primary teeth with pulpitis or pulp necrosis. Document [4] mentions that indirect pulp therapy (IPT) has a significantly higher success in treating all primary first molars, but especially those with reversible pulpitis compared with formocresol pulpotomy (FP). Document [8] states that direct pulp capping in asymptomatic carious primary molars may be an acceptable option when treating an exposed pulp with bioceramic materials as pulp capping agents. Based on these documents, it can be inferred that pulpectomy and pulp capping are more successful in primary teeth because of the higher success rates of indirect pulp therapy and the use of bioceramic materials for direct pulp capping.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
