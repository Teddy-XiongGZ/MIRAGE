The t-test is specifically designed for comparing means under relaxed conditions. It is commonly used when comparing two samples, typically experimental and control samples from a scientifically controlled experiment. The t-test calculates the statistic to test whether the means are different and takes into account the sample sizes and variances of the two groups. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
