    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child developed hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly after being weaned from breast milk and given sugarcane juice. Biochemical examination showed hypophosphatemia and enzyme deficiencies. Based on these symptoms and findings, the child is most likely suffering from a deficiency of glucose 6 phosphatase, which is responsible for glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. This deficiency leads to impaired glucose production and hypoglycemia. The hepatomegaly is likely due to glycogen accumulation in the liver. The other enzyme deficiencies listed in the options (fructokinase, aldolase B, beta galactosidase) are not associated with the symptoms and findings described in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Glucose 6 Phosphatase\"}"
