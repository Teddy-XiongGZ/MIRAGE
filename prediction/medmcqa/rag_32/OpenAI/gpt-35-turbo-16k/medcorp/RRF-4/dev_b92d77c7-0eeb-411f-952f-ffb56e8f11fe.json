    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, a drop in fetal heart rate that typically lasts less than 2 minutes and is usually associated with umbilical cord compression is called a variable deceleration. Variable decelerations are defined as abrupt decreases in fetal heart rate, with less than 30 seconds from the beginning of the decrease to the nadir of heart rate. The decrease in FHR is at least 15 beats per minute, lasting at least 15 seconds but less than 2 minutes in duration. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Variable deceleration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
