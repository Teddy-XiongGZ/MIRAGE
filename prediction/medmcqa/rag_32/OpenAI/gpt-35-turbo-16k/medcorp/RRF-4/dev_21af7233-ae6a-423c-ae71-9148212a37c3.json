    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcium ions trigger muscle contraction by binding to troponin. Troponin is a regulatory protein that is located on the actin filament in muscle cells. When calcium ions bind to troponin, it causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex, which exposes the binding sites on actin for myosin. This allows myosin to bind to actin and initiate the sliding of the actin and myosin filaments, leading to muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
