    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) are characterized by a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) developed between 24 hours and 28 days after transfusion. This means that option A, Positive DAT, is a characteristic feature of DHTR. Spherocytes positive and haemoglobinuria are also commonly seen in DHTR. However, reduced haemoglobin is not a characteristic feature of DHTR. In fact, in a patient with DHTR, an inadequate rise of post-transfusion haemoglobin or rapid fall in haemoglobin back to pre-transfusion levels is observed. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Reduced haemoglobin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
