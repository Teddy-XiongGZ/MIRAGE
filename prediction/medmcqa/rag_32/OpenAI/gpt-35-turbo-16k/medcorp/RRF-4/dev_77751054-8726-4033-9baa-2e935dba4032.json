    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endogenous staining of teeth during development refers to staining that occurs during tooth development before birth or in early childhood. To determine which of the options is not responsible for endogenous staining, we need to examine the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that intrinsic staining primarily occurs during tooth development and cannot be removed through mechanical measures. Document [2] mentions that tetracycline and minocycline can cause yellow-green discoloration of dentine visible through the enamel, which is a form of intrinsic staining.
