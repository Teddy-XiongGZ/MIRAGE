    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which dentifrices should be used for periodontal patients, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] suggests that a dentifrice containing three kinds of bactericidal ingredients can prevent the progression of periodontal disease. Document [1] supports the use of a triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice for improved supragingival plaque control, gingival health, and prevention of gingivitis progressing to periodontitis. Document [2] indicates that a dentifrice containing bioactive glass, CSPS, and arginine can relieve dentine hypersensitivity in patients undergoing non-surgical periodontal therapy. Document [3] advises dentists to interpret the therapeutic claims of various antiplaque and antigingivitis dentifrices cautiously. Based on this information, the most appropriate choice for dentifrices to be used for periodontal patients would be C. Tooth pastes with minimum abrasive content, as they can help prevent the progression of periodontal disease, improve plaque control, and relieve dentine hypersensitivity without causing excessive abrasion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
