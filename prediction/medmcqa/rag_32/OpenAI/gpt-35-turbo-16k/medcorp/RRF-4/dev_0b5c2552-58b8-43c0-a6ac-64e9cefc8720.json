    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most effective immediate action to take when a child accidentally swallows a fluoride solution is to have the child drink milk or some other calcium-containing liquid. Calcium can help to bind with the fluoride and reduce its absorption in the body. Drinking copious quantities of water may help to dilute the fluoride, but it is not as effective as consuming a calcium-containing liquid. Sodium bicarbonate solution is not recommended as it may increase the absorption of fluoride. Sending the child to the family physician may be necessary for further evaluation and treatment, but it is not the most effective immediate action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
