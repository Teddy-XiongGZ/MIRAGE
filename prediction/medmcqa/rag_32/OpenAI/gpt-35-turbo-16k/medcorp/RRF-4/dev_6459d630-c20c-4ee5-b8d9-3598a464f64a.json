    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the chances of recurrence of multicystic ameloblastoma after surgical enucleation, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the recurrence rate after conservative treatments, including enucleation, was 33.3% for cystic ameloblastomas. Document [5] also mentions that the relative risk of recurrence for multicystic ameloblastomas treated with conservative treatment was 3.15-fold greater compared to radical treatment. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the chances of recurrence of multicystic ameloblastoma after surgical enucleation are high, and therefore the answer is C. 50-100%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 50-100%\"}"
