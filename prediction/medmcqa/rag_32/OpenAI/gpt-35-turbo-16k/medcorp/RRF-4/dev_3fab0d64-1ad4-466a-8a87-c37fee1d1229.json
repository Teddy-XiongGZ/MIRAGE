    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old male child presenting with abnormal body movements and MRI findings of signal changes in the corpus striatum, thalami, pons, medulla, centrum semiovale, and asymmetric diffuse white matter involvement. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is a metabolic disorder characterized by copper accumulation in various organs, including the brain. Neurological manifestations can include movement disorders, such as dystonia and tremors, which are consistent with the abnormal body movements seen in this patient. The MRI findings of signal changes in the basal ganglia (corpus striatum) and thalami are also consistent with Wilson's disease. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Wilson's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
