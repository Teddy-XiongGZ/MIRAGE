    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of the genes on chromosome 21, rather than the usual two. Trisomy of chromosome 21 is the main cause of Down syndrome. Mosaicism of chromosome 21, where some cells have trisomy 21 and others have a normal chromosome complement, can also cause Down syndrome. Robertsonian translocation of chromosome 21, where a part of chromosome 21 is located on another chromosome, can also result in Down syndrome. However, deletion of chromosome 21 is not a known cause of Down syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Deletion of 21.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
