    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GFR is the glomerular filtration rate, which describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. To determine what increases GFR, we need to consider the factors that affect renal blood flow and the constriction or dilation of the afferent and efferent arterioles. Increased renal blood flow and efferent arteriole constriction both lead to increased GFR. On the other hand, a renal stone in the ureter can cause obstruction and decrease GFR. Decreased oncotic pressure, which refers to a decrease in the osmotic pressure due to a decrease in plasma proteins, can also decrease GFR. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Renal stone in ureter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
