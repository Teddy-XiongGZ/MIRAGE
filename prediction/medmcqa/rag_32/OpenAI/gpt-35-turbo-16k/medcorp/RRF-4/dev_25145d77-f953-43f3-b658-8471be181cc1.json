    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pH is within the normal range (7.35-7.45), indicating no acid-base abnormality. The pCO2 is within the normal range (35-45 mm Hg), indicating no respiratory acidosis or alkalosis. The HCO3 is within the normal range (22-28 mEq/L), indicating no metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. The Na and Cl levels are within the normal range. Therefore, the observation is that there is no acid-base abnormality (choice C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
