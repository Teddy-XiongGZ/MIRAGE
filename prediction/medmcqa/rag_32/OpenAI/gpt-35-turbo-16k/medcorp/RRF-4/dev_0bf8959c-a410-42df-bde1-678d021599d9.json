    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anterior teeth have a mesiodistal size greater than the cervicoincisal dimension, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. The documents provide data on the mesiodistal and cervicoincisal dimensions of various teeth in different populations. We need to find information specifically about the mesiodistal and cervicoincisal dimensions of the anterior teeth. After analyzing the relevant documents, we can determine the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
