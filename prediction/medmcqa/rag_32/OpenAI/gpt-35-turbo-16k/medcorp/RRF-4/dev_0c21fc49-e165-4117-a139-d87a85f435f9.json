    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is a non-parametric test, we need to understand the characteristics of non-parametric tests. Non-parametric tests are used when the data does not meet the assumptions of parametric tests, such as normal distribution or equal variances. They make fewer assumptions and are more robust. Looking at the given options, Pearson correlation and ANOVA are parametric tests that assume normal distribution. Student t-test can be either parametric or non-parametric depending on the assumptions. The Mann-Whitney test, on the other hand, is a non-parametric test that compares the medians of two independent groups. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Mann whitney test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
