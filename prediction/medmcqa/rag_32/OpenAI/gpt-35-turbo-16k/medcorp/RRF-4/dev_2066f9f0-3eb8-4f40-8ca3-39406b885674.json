    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which space is not directly connected to the lateral pharyngeal space, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] describes the anatomy of the parapharyngeal space, which is adjacent to the lateral pharyngeal wall. Document [11] mentions that the lateral pharyngeal space communicates with the buccal space anteriorly and the sublingual space medially. Document [14] states that the submandibular space is connected to the lateral pharyngeal space posteriorly. Finally, document [7] discusses infections of the lateral pharyngeal space, indicating that the retropharyngeal space can be involved individually. Based on this information, we can conclude that the lateral pharyngeal space is not directly connected to the buccal space, sublingual space, or retropharyngeal space. Therefore, the answer is C. Submandibular space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
