    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, impedance-based apex locators are described as the third generation of apex locators. The documents mention that the third generation of apex locators solved the problem of detecting the apex in the presence of conducting fluids by using two alternating frequencies and calculating the impedance between them. This improved the accuracy and reliability of the apex locators. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Generation 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
