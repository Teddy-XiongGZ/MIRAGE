    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most frequently used restorative material, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [16] states that the increased use of resin-based composite materials, including posterior composites, is clearly evident. Document [20] mentions that composite resin technology has simplified the manner in which clinicians practice restorative dentistry, offering greater predictability and improved physical properties. Document [24] indicates that resin-based composites are the most commonly used restorative material. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most frequently used restorative material is C. Composite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
