    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucocorticoid deficiency refers to a deficiency in the production or action of glucocorticoid hormones, such as cortisol. To determine the features of glucocorticoid deficiency, we need to consider the effects of cortisol on the body. Cortisol has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, so a deficiency in cortisol would result in increased inflammation and immune response. This could lead to symptoms such as fever. Cortisol also plays a role in regulating electrolyte balance, so a deficiency in cortisol could lead to imbalances in electrolytes such as potassium, resulting in hyperkalemia. Cortisol also helps maintain blood pressure, so a deficiency in cortisol could lead to postural hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure upon standing. Finally, cortisol is involved in metabolism, so a deficiency in cortisol could lead to weight loss. Based on this information, all of the given features (fever, hyperkalemia, postural hypotension, and weight loss) could be seen in glucocorticoid deficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
