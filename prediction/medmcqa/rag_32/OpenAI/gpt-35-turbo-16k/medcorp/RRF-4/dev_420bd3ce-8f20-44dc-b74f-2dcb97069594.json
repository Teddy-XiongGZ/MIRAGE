    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the appropriate brushing technique for gingival recession, we need to review the relevant documents that discuss the relationship between brushing technique and gingival recession. Document [1] states that a subsequent study found horizontal tooth brushing technique (versus Bass technique or circular methods) was associated with gingival recession. Document [6] mentions that the greatest amount of gingival recession was found in the horizontal scrub technique. Document [12] also states that the scrub method resulted in greater gingival recession and loss of attached gingiva than the roll and bass methods. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the brushing technique associated with gingival recession is the horizontal scrub technique. Therefore, the answer is C.
