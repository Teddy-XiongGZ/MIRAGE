    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The purpose of the plane of orientation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, based on the given options, it can be inferred that the plane of orientation serves as an arbitrary plane when established on the articulator (Option C). This is because the plane of orientation is used as a reference plane for mounting dental casts on an articulator, which is a device used to simulate jaw movements and aid in dental treatments. The other options, such as guiding the establishment of occlusal plane, measuring height and length of posterior teeth, or dividing the distance between upper and lower casts equally, are not directly related to the concept of the plane of orientation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
