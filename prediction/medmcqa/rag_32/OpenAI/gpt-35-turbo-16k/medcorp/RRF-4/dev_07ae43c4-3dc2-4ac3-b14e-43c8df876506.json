    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anticoagulant is used to send the blood sample for blood glucose in PHC, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that blood can be collected in a vacutainer with anticoagulants such as potassium oxalate, potassium EDTA, sodium citrate, or heparin without the addition of sodium fluoride for the plasma sample. Document [9] states that samples should contain the glycolysis inhibitor sodium fluoride (which inhibits the enolase enzyme) at 2.5 mg fluoride/mL of blood, in combination with anticoagulants such as potassium oxalate. Document [18] compares different tubes for glucose measurement and mentions that GlucoEXACT tubes containing sodium fluoride/citrate buffer liquid mixture are equivalent to those collected in reference plasma tubes. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Potassium oxalate + sodium fluoride.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
