    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common cyst associated with adjoining vital teeth, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that vitality testing must be performed on teeth associated with a nasopalatine duct cyst to rule out an odontogenic source. However, nasopalatine duct cyst is not listed as one of the potential choices. Document [2] mentions a case report where microsurgical management was aimed at enucleating a large radicular cyst while maintaining the vitality of adjacent teeth. Radicular cysts are also known as periapical cysts, which is one of the potential choices. Document [5] describes dentigerous cysts as one of the most common developmental types of odontogenic cysts. Dentigerous cysts are associated with the crown of an unerupted or impacted tooth and often manifest as incidental findings. Document [12] confirms that radicular cysts are the most common odontogenic cysts, accounting for up to two-thirds of all cysts of the jaws. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most common cyst associated with adjoining vital teeth is likely the radicular cyst or periapical cyst.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
