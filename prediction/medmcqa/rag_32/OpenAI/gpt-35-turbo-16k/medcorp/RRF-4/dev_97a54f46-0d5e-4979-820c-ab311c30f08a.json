    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the cardiovascular system undergoes several adaptations to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients. One of these adaptations is an increase in stroke volume, which is the amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle with each heartbeat. The end-systolic volume (ESV) is the volume of blood remaining in the left ventricle at the end of systole, or contraction. To determine the effect of exercise on ESV, we can refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the response of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction to exercise in patients with aortic regurgitation. It states that in the control group, ESV decreased by 22% during exercise. Document [1] also mentions that during exercise, ESV decreased in runners. These findings suggest that during exercise, ESV tends to decrease. Based on this information, the answer is: A. ESV decreases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
