    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the formula for urea clearance, C = U x V/P, U denotes the urinary concentration. The formula calculates the clearance of urea by multiplying the urinary concentration (U) by the volume of distribution (V) and dividing it by the plasma concentration (P). Therefore, the correct answer is C. Urinary concentration in mg/ml.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
