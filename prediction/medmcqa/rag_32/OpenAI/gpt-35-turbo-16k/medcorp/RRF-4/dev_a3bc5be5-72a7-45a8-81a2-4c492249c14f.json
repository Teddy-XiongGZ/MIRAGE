    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the host tissue response in acute inflammation. Acute inflammation is characterized by the exudation of fluid and plasma proteins, vasodilation, increased permeability, and the migration of neutrophils and macrophages to the site of inflammation. The host tissue response in acute inflammation is typically exudative, meaning there is an exudation of fluid and plasma proteins. Necrotizing inflammation refers to tissue necrosis, which is not a characteristic of acute inflammation. Granulomatous inflammation is a type of chronic inflammation, not acute inflammation. Cytopathic refers to damage to cells, which can occur in acute inflammation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Necrotizing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
