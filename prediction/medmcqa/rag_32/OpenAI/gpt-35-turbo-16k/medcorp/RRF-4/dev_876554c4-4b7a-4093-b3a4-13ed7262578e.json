    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for a metabolic condition that has both phosphaturia and osteomalacia. To answer this, we need to look for information about conditions that cause both phosphaturia (increased excretion of phosphate in the urine) and osteomalacia (softening of the bones due to poor mineralization). From the provided documents, we can see that the condition that matches these criteria is tumor-induced osteomalacia. This condition is characterized by phosphaturia, hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate levels), and osteomalacia. The tumor responsible for tumor-induced osteomalacia secretes a phosphaturic factor, which leads to increased phosphate excretion and subsequent hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia. Therefore, the answer is not any of the provided choices, but rather tumor-induced osteomalacia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
