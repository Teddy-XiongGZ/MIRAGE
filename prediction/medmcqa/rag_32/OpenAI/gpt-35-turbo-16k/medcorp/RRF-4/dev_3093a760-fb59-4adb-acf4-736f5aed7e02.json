    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, fibroblasts are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues by continuously secreting precursors of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The composition of the ECM determines the physical properties of connective tissues. Fibroblasts produce a diverse group of products including collagen type I, III, and IV, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminins, glycosaminoglycans, metalloproteinases, and even prostaglandins. However, there is no specific mention of the type of collagen secreted by fibroblasts in the cell-rich zone. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine which type of collagen is primarily secreted by fibroblasts in the cell-rich zone based on the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
