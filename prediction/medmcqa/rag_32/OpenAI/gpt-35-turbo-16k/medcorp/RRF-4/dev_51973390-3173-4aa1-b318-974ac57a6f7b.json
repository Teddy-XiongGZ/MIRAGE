    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the suitable technique used for the diagnosis of posterior interproximal caries in children, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that bitewing X-rays were better at diagnosing caries lesions than clinical examination. Document [3] also mentions that bitewing radiographs were effective in detecting approximal surface caries in deciduous teeth. Document [7] compares the diagnostic properties of intraoral bitewing radiographs (BTW) and periapical radiographs (PA) for early stage interproximal caries and concludes that BTWs offer a significant advantage over PAs in diagnosing early stages of interproximal carious lesions. Document [12] compares extraoral panoramic bitewings (BWs) to intraoral photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plate BWs for the detection of proximal surface caries and finds that both techniques are equally useful. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the suitable technique used for the diagnosis of posterior interproximal caries in children is Bite wing radiography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Bite wing with Bisecting angle technique\"}"
