    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the use of filters in X-ray machines. Document [3] states that X-ray filters, including aluminium filters, are used to selectively attenuate low-energy rays during X-ray imaging. These low-energy X-rays contribute little to the resultant image and are heavily absorbed by the patient's soft tissues, particularly the skin. Therefore, the principal reason for placing an aluminium filter in the primary beam of radiation is to reduce radiation to the skin of the patient. This aligns with option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
