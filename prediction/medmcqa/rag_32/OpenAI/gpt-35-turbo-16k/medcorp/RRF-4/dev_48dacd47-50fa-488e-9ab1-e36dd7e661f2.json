Supernumerary teeth are extra teeth that can disrupt the normal eruption and alignment of the permanent teeth. They are commonly associated with rotation and other irregularities. Therefore, it is important to rule out the presence of supernumerary teeth before proceeding with any other treatment options. If supernumerary teeth are present, appropriate management can be planned accordingly.
