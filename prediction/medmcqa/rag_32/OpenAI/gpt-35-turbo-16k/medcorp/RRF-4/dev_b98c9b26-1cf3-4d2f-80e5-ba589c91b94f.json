    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The next best investigation for a 2-day-old neonate with seizures would be an EEG (electroencephalogram) to confirm the presence of seizures and determine the type and location of the seizure activity. However, since none of the provided options include an EEG, we need to choose the best alternative. Transcranial ultrasound (option A) is not typically used to investigate seizures in neonates. CT Head (option B) and MRI brain (option C) can provide valuable information about the underlying cause of seizures, but MRI brain is generally preferred over CT Head in neonates due to its superior soft tissue resolution and lack of ionizing radiation. X-ray (option D) is not typically used to investigate seizures. Therefore, the next best investigation for the child would be option C: MRI brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
