    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the primary nature of a 6-year-old's fear related to dentistry, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the level of dental fear in middle childhood (which includes 6-year-olds) is not significantly influenced by personal and social factors.
