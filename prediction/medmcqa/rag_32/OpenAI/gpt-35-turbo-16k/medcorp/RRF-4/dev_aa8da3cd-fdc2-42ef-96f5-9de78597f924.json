    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which antibiotic is most frequently associated with pseudomembranous colitis, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the fourth group of antibiotics, represented by cefixime and the association amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, is 7 times more frequently associated with pseudomembranous colitis than antibiotics of the second group. However, Document [3] mentions that apart from clindamycin, the first antibiotic recognized to be clearly associated with pseudomembranous colitis, the antimicrobial agents most commonly responsible are cephalosporins and ampicillin (or amoxicillin). Therefore, based on the information provided, the most frequently associated antibiotic with pseudomembranous colitis is C. Clindamycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
