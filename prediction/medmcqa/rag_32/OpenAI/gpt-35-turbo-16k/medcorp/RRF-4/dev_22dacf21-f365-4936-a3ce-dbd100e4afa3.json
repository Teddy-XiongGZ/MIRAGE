    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigability. It primarily affects the muscles involved in movement and can cause symptoms such as ptosis (drooping of the eyelids) and muscle fatigability. The disease is caused by autoantibodies that target the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to impaired transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. As a result, muscle weakness and fatigability occur. However, myasthenia gravis does not typically affect deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) or the pupillary reflex. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Absent DTRs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
