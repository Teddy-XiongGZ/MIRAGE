    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which premolar has a mesial marginal ridge more cervical than the distal marginal ridge, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] describes the anatomy of the mandibular second premolar, stating that the mesial and distal contacts with adjacent teeth are positioned buccal to the midpoint. Document [2] provides similar information about the mandibular second premolar, stating that the distal height of contour is slightly closer to the gingival than the mesial height of contour. On the other hand, Document [10] describes the maxillary first premolar, stating that the buccal cusp is at the contact between the buccal and middle thirds, and the central groove is at the contact of the middle and lingual thirds. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is A. Maxillary 1st premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
