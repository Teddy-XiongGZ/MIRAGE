    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, amino acid replacements can be classified as conservative or radical. Conservative replacements are exchanges between amino acids with similar properties and are expected to rarely result in dysfunction in the corresponding protein. On the other hand, radical replacements are exchanges between amino acids with different properties and can lead to changes in protein structure or function. Therefore, if an amino acid is replaced by another amino acid with similar properties, it is likely that the function of the protein will not be changed. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Glutamine to Asparagine, as both amino acids have similar properties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
