    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about CRISPR Cas9, we need to evaluate each statement one by one. \\n\\nA. gRNA ensures that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome: This statement is true. The guide RNA (gRNA) is designed to recognize and bind to the target sequence in the genome, guiding the Cas9 enzyme to the correct location for cutting.\\n\\nB. NHEJ repair & HDR pathway: This statement is true. After the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA, the repair of the double-stranded break can occur through two main pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR).\\n\\nC. Cas9 enzyme is used in CRISPR gene editing: This statement is true. The Cas9 enzyme is a key component of the CRISPR gene editing system. It is responsible for cutting the DNA at the desired location.\\n\\nD. All of these: This statement is not true because statement B is true. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
