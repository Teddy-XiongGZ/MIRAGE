    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with absent thumb, radial deviation of wrist, bowing of forearm, and thrombocytopenia. The key feature here is thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. Therefore, it is not necessary to perform a platelet count as an investigation. Echocardiography may be done to evaluate for any cardiac abnormalities associated with the syndrome. Bone marrow examination may be done to assess the cause of thrombocytopenia. Karyotyping may be done to evaluate for any chromosomal abnormalities.
