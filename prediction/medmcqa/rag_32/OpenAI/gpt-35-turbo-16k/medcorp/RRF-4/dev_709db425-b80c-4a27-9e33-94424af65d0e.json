After reviewing the documents, we find that bifid roots are mentioned in Document [0], Document [2], Document [4], Document [9], Document [10], Document [14], Document [24], and Document [30]. However, none of these documents provide specific information about the numbers 32, 42, 31, 41, 34, 44, 13, or 23 having a bifid root.
