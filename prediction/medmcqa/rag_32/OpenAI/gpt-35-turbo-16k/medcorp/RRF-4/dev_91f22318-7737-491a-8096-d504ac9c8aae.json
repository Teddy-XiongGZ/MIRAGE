    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mean and standard deviation can be calculated only if the data is on an interval/ratio scale. The mean and standard deviation calculations require numerical values that have a consistent and meaningful order, which is characteristic of interval/ratio scales. Dichotomous, nominal, and ordinal scales do not provide the necessary numerical values for calculating the mean and standard deviation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
