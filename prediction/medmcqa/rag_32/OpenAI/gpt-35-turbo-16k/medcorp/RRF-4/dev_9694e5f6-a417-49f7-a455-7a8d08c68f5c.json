    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary site of action of antidiuretic hormone is on the renal collecting ducts, specifically the distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney. Antidiuretic hormone acts on the V2 receptors on the basolateral membrane of principal cells in the collecting duct, increasing water reabsorption by promoting the insertion of aquaporin 2 channels into the luminal membrane. This leads to the reabsorption of water and the production of concentrated urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
