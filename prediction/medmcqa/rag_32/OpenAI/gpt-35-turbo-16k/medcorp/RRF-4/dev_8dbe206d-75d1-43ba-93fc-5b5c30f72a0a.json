    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the differential diagnosis of CGCG based on histologically and morphologically similarities, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [2] mentions that the essential cytologic findings of CGCG include a dual cell population consisting of mononuclear stromal cells and multinucleate giant cells. These features are considered not specific for the diagnosis of CGCG and are identical to those of osteitis fibrosa cystica and giant cell tumor of bone. Therefore, the differential diagnosis for CGCG based on histologically and morphologically similarities includes osteitis fibrosa cystica and giant cell tumor of bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
