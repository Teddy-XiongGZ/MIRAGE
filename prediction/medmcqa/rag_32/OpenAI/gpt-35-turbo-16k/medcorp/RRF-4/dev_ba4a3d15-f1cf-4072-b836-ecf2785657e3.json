    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which substance does not cross the placenta, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [28] states that drugs with molecular weights >1000 cross the placenta poorly. Document [15] mentions that chloroprocaine, which has a rapid metabolism and does not participate in ion trapping, does not cross the placenta. However, none of the provided options match these descriptions. Therefore, we need to consider other information. Document [2] classifies drugs according to their type of transfer across the placenta. It states that drugs with molecular weights greater than 500D have an incomplete transfer across the human placenta. Based on this information, we can conclude that Heparin, which is a very large molecule, does not cross the placenta. Therefore, the answer is A. Heparin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
