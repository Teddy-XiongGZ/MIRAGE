    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which antibiotic is effective against Pseudomonas and indole-positive Proteus, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [4] states that 6-[d(-)-alpha-carboxy-3-thienylacetamido] penicillanic acid (BRL2288) is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Document [14] mentions that cefotaxime, a cephalosporin antibiotic, is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and indole-positive Proteus. Document [22] states that ceftazidime, another cephalosporin antibiotic, exhibits good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on this information, the correct answer is a cephalosporin antibiotic. Therefore, the answer is not A. Methicillin, B. Carbenicillin, or D. Oxacillin. The correct answer is C. Lincomycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
