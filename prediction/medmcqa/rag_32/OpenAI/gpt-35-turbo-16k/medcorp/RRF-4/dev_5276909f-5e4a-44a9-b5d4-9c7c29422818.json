    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the structure and arrangement of flagella in different bacterial species. To determine which organism most closely resembles the one depicted in the diagram, we need to consider the information about flagella arrangement and the specific bacteria mentioned in the documents. Document [0] describes Vibrio cholerae as a bacterium with a helical appendage at one end, which matches the helical flagella shown in the diagram. Document [4] mentions that Vibrio cholerae is an example of a bacterium with a single flagellum, which is consistent with the diagram. Therefore, the organism depicted in the diagram most closely resembles Vibrio cholerae. Hence, the correct answer is C. Vibrio cholera.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
