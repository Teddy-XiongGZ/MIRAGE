    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient has been diagnosed with stage T3N2M0 oral cancer. The standard treatment for oral cancer typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is usually the primary treatment modality for removing the tumor. In this case, since the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (N2), surgery alone may not be sufficient. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option would be surgery combined with additional therapies. Both radiation therapy (option B) and chemotherapy (option D) have been shown to be effective in treating oral cancer. However, since the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, the addition of radiation therapy to the surgical treatment would be more appropriate. Therefore, the answer choice is B. Surgery + radiotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
