Document [0] mentions that typical radiographic features of osteosarcoma include long-bone metaphyseal location, mixed areas of lysis and sclerosis, cortical destruction, periosteal new bone, and soft-tissue mass. Document [1] states that osteosarcoma can have different appearances on imaging, ranging from densely sclerotic to lytic or even cystic.
