    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the role of Rb gene phosphorylation in the cell cycle. Document [0] states that phosphorylation of the RB protein occurs between 10-20 hours after stimulation, which corresponds with the induction of DNA synthesis. Document [2] mentions that in its unphosphorylated state, Rb blocks the transition from G0 or resting state to S or synthesis. Document [6] explains that unphosphorylated Rb inhibits E2F transcriptional program and can arrest cells in the G1 phase. Based on this information, if the Rb gene phosphorylation is defective, it is likely that the cell cycle will stop at the G1 phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
