    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the method of transport of glucose in the intestine is primarily through secondary active transport. Document [0] mentions that glucose is taken up into the intestinal epithelium via a secondary active transport mechanism called sodium ion-glucose symport via sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). Document [8] also states that glucose absorption in the small intestine is mainly through the transcellular pathway, which is an active process requiring energy expenditure in the form of ATP. Therefore, the answer choice is B. Secondary active transpo.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
