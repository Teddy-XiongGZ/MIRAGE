    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which muscles are elevators of the mandible, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss the muscles of mastication and their functions. Document [2] states that the primary muscles of mastication are the temporalis, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and masseter muscles. Document [6] confirms that the masseter muscle is an elevator of the mandible. Document [7] states that the medial pterygoid muscle also causes elevation and protrusion of the mandible. Document [10] describes the temporalis muscle as an elevator of the mandible. However, document [24] states that the digastric muscle is involved in opening the mouth and depressing the mandible. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Digastric.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
