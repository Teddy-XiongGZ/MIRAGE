    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the ideal depth for root end filling with MTA, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the apical 3 mm of each root in both groups were resected and filled with MTA. Document [5] mentions that different thicknesses of MTA (1, 2, 3, and 4 mm) were compared, and the 4 mm thickness was found to be the most effective in preventing apical leakage. Document [26] also compares microleakage at three different thicknesses of MTA (1 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm) and finds that the microleakage was less at the 3 mm depth. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the ideal depth for root end filling with MTA is 3mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 3mm\"}"
