    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] discusses the rationale and preparation of a rest seat on the marginal ridge of a canine crown. Document [3] mentions that lingual rest seats are preferred on anterior teeth because they are more esthetically acceptable and located closer to the center of rotation of the tooth. Document [10] states that positive anterior rests are essential for stress distribution in removable partial dentures involving anterior teeth. Based on this information, we can conclude that the preferred rest seat on a canine is on the lingual surface because it is more esthetically acceptable and provides better stress distribution. Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options given.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not provided in the options\"}"
