    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) binds to androgens and estrogens, but not to progesterone or DHEA. Therefore, the hormone that will be affected most after the change in SHBG is either testosterone or estrogen. From the documents, it is mentioned that SHBG has a higher affinity for dihydrotestosterone (DHT) than testosterone and estradiol. However, it is not specified whether the change in SHBG will increase or decrease its binding capacity for these hormones. Therefore, it is not possible to determine definitively which hormone will be affected most based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
