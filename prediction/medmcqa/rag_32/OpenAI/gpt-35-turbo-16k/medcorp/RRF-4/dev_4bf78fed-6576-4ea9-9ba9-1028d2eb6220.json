    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which approach is not used for removal of vertebral disc, we need to understand the different approaches mentioned in the documents. Laminotomy, laminectomy, laminoplasty, and hemilaminectomy are all surgical procedures that involve removing a portion of the lamina, which is a part of the vertebral arch. Laminotomy involves removing a small portion of the lamina, while laminectomy involves removing the entire lamina. Laminoplasty is a procedure that involves creating a hinge in the lamina to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. Hemilaminectomy involves removing only one side of the lamina. Based on this information, it can be concluded that all of these approaches involve removing a portion of the lamina, except for laminoplasty, which involves creating a hinge in the lamina. Therefore, the answer is C. Laminoplasty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
