    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inter dose interval refers to the time interval between doses of a drug. To determine the inter dose interval, we need to consider factors that affect the timing of drug administration. The half-life of a drug is the time it takes for the concentration of the drug in the body to decrease by half. If a drug has a short half-life, it may require more frequent dosing and a shorter inter dose interval. On the other hand, if a drug has a long half-life, it may require less frequent dosing and a longer inter dose interval. Therefore, the inter dose interval depends on the half-life of the drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
