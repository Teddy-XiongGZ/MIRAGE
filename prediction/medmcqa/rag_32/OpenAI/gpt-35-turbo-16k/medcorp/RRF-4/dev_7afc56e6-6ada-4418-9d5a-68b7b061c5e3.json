    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which part of the brain aspirin acts on, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the analgesic effects of aspirin were found in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices and anterior parts of the anterior cingulate cortex. Document [2] suggests that aspirin may act centrally in pain processing. Document [4] mentions that aspirin reduces the size of infarcts after ischemic stroke and inhibits glutamate release in \"in vitro\" models of brain ischemia. Document [14] explains that low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. Based on this information, it can be concluded that aspirin acts on the cortex of the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
