    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about the latent phase of labor, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. The documents provide information about the definition and characteristics of the latent phase of labor. We can start by eliminating statements that are supported by the documents. Statement A is supported by Document 2, which states that the onset of the active phase is generally defined as cervical dilatation of 4-10 cm. However, there is no mention of ACOG planning to increase it to 5 cm. Statement B is supported by Document 2, which states that the first stage of labor is divided into the latent and active phases. Statement C is supported by Document 2, which describes Braxton Hicks contractions as contractions that may start around 26 weeks gestation and are sometimes called 'false labor'. Statement D is supported by Document 2, which states that the latent phase of labor generally begins at the point at which the woman perceives regular uterine contractions. Based on the information provided in the documents, it appears that statement A is not true about the latent phase of labor. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
