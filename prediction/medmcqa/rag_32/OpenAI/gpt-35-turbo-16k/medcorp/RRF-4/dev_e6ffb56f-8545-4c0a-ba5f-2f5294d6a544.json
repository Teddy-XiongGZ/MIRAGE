Document [1] titled 'Setting time of construction gypsum, dental plaster, and white orthodontic gypsum' provides information on the measurement of setting time using a Gillmore needle, according to ASTM C266-03. This method involves measuring the initial setting time using a 2.12-mm needle and the final setting time using a 1.06-mm needle. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the Vicat needle method is used to measure the setting time of dental materials.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Vicat needle method\"}"
