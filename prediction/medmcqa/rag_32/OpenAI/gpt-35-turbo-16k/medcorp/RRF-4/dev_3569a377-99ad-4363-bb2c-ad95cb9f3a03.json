    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the working time of zinc polycarboxylate cement, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [12] states that zinc polycarboxylate cement has a short working time, which can be elongated by adding tartaric acid, mixing on a cold glass slab, or using a lower powder: liquid ratio. However, the specific duration of the working time is not mentioned in this document. Document [15] also mentions that zinc polycarboxylate cement has a short working time. Based on the available information, we cannot determine the exact working time of zinc polycarboxylate cement. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not provided\"}"
