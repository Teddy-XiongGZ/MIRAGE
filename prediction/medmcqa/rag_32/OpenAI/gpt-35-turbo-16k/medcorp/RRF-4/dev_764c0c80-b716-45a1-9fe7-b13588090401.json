    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the central value of a set of 180 values, we need to determine the measure of central tendency that represents the middle or central value. The options provided are the 2nd tertile, 90th percentile, 2nd quartile, and 9th decile. The 2nd tertile refers to the value that divides the data into three equal parts, with 1/3 of the data below and 2/3 above. This is not the measure of central tendency we are looking for. The 90th percentile represents the value below which 90% of the data falls. This is not the measure of central tendency we are looking for either. The 2nd quartile, also known as the median, represents the value that divides the data into two equal parts, with 50% of the data below and 50% above. This is a measure of central tendency and represents the central value of the set. The 9th decile represents the value below which 90% of the data falls. This is not the measure of central tendency we are looking for. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 2nd quartile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
