    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which hormone(s) are under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus, we need to look for information about inhibitory hormones released by the hypothalamus. Document [19] mentions that the hypothalamus uses somatostatin to inhibit the actions of Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH), which controls the release of Growth Hormone (GH).
