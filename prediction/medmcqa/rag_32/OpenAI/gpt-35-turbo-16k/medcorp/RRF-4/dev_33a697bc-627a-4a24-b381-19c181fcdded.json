    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant document [2] provides information about the time of passage of the first urine in newborns. It states that urine is usually passed in the first 24 hours of life. However, if a newborn does not pass urine for 36 hours, there may be concerns about voiding. In such cases, the document suggests repeating the physical exam to evaluate the genitals and abdomen for any missed abnormalities, and if there are valid concerns about voiding, catheterization and ultrasound along with a urology consultation should take place. Therefore, the method of choice for a newborn not passing urine for 36 hours would be ultrasound of the kidney and bladder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
