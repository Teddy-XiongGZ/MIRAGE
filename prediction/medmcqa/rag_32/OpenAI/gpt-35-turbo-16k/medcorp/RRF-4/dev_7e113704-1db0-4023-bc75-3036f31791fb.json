    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the appropriate answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. Document [12] mentions that arch length analysis is used to determine tooth size-arch length discrepancy, which can indicate crowding or spacing. Document [18] states that tooth size discrepancy (TSD) of 2 mm is considered clinically significant. However, there is no specific information about a discrepancy of more than 10 mm. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine the answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot determine\"}"
