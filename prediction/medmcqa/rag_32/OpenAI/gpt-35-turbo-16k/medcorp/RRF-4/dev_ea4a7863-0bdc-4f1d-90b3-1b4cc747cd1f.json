    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the true statement regarding proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are proteins that are heavily glycosylated, consisting of a core protein to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. This aligns with statement A. The documents also mention that GAG chains are negatively charged under physiological conditions due to the occurrence of sulfate and uronic acid groups, which supports statement C. However, there is no mention of GAG chains containing oxidized acid sugars, so statement B cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
