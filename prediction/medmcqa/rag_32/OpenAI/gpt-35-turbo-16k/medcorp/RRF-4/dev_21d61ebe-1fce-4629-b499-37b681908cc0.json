    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman is detected to have bilateral cornual block on hysterosalpingography. Cornual block refers to the blockage of the fallopian tubes at the level of the cornua, which is the area where the fallopian tubes join the uterus. In this case, the ideal management would be to perform hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. Hysteroscopy allows direct visualization of the uterine cavity and can help identify any intrauterine abnormalities that may be contributing to infertility. Laparoscopy, on the other hand, allows visualization of the pelvic organs, including the fallopian tubes, and can help determine the extent of tubal blockage and assess for any other pelvic pathology. Based on the findings of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, further management options can be considered, such as tuboplasty (surgical repair of the fallopian tubes), in-vitro fertilization (IVF), or other appropriate interventions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
