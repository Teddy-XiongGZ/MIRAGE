    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the highly vascular tumor of the brain and spinal cord in adults, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [10] mentions that hemangioblastomas of the posterior cranial fossa and spinal cord in adults are excessively vascularized tumors. Document [16] also discusses a case of a tumor in the thoracic spine that was diagnosed as a spinal hemangioblastoma. On the other hand, there is no specific mention of metastasis, pilocytic astrocytoma, or cavernous malformation being highly vascular tumors of the brain and spinal cord in adults. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Hemangioblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
