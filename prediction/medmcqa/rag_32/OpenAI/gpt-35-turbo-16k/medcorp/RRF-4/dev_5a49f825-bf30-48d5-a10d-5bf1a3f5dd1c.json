    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the characteristic histopathological feature of basal cell carcinoma, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] describes the histopathology of nodular basal cell carcinoma, stating that it shows aggregates of basaloid cells with well-defined borders, peripheral palisading of cells, and one or more typical clefts. Document [3] mentions that the superficial subtype of basal cell carcinoma has multiple small buds of basaloid cells descending from the epidermis with no dermal invasion. Document [7] provides an overview of the main classes of basal cell carcinoma, including superficial, infiltrative, and nodular types. Based on this information, the characteristic histopathological feature of basal cell carcinoma is nuclear palisading, as described in Document [0].\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
