    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During intense exercise, the rapid source of energy for resynthesizing ATP in exercising muscles is phosphocreatine. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy phosphate compound that can rapidly donate a phosphate group to ADP to regenerate ATP. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. Glycolysis and glycogenolysis are also involved in ATP resynthesis, but they are not as rapid as phosphocreatine. The TCA cycle is part of aerobic metabolism and is not a rapid source of energy during intense exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phosphocreatine\"}"
