    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided information, the young marathon runner developed pain at the anteromedial aspect of the tibia after running for 100 meters. The pain increased with further running and the X-ray was normal. The doctor ordered a bone scan to further evaluate the condition. Given these findings, the likely diagnosis is shin splints. Shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, is a common overuse injury in runners characterized by pain along the shin bone (tibia). It is typically caused by repetitive stress on the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue in the lower leg. X-rays are usually normal in shin splints, and a bone scan may be ordered to rule out other possible causes of the pain. Lisfranc fracture, Jones fracture, and Nutcracker fracture are not consistent with the provided information and are less likely diagnoses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Shin splint\"}"
