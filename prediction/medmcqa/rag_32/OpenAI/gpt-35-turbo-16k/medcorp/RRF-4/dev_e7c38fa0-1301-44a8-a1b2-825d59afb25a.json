    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the maximum torque during implant placement, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [0] states that most studies evaluated delayed loading, except for one study that evaluated immediate implant loading. The meta-analysis in this document indicated no significant difference between high- and regular- or low-torque implant placement in terms of implant survival rate and marginal bone loss. Document [2] mentions that forces \u226530 Ncm are routinely used to place implants into healed ridges and fresh extraction sockets prior to immediate loading of implants. Document [3] states that the maximum insertion torque recorded for one implant system was 59.9 Ncm. Document [4] evaluates the effect of repeated use of an implant handpiece and mentions that the implant placement torque was set at 35 Ncm. Document [6] recommends an insertion torque range of 5 to 10 Ncm for 1.6-mm diameter mini-implants. Document [8] examines the effect of different torque application techniques and mentions that the torque value used was 35 Ncm. Document [10] evaluates the correlation between insertion torque and the survival rate of immediately loaded implants and states that the mean insertion torque was 72.1 Ncm. Based on these documents, there is no specific maximum torque value mentioned during implant placement. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be determined from the provided information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
