    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement about gutta-percha is not true, we need to evaluate each statement individually. \\n\\nA. It contains 60-70% gutta-percha and 20% ZnO: This statement is true. Gutta-percha is a polymer of isoprene and does not contain ZnO. \\n\\nB. Can be sterilized by heating: This statement is true. Gutta-percha can be sterilized by heating. \\n\\nC. With time they become brittle: This statement is true. Over time, gutta-percha can become brittle and lose its flexibility. \\n\\nD. It has two forms \u03b1 and \u03b2: This statement is true. Gutta-percha has two forms, \u03b1 and \u03b2. \\n\\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, it appears that all statements are true. Therefore, the answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
