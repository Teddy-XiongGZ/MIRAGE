    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the number of patterns of Accessory Canals in mandibular molars, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions the prevalence of different types of accessory canals in the furcation area of mandibular molars, but it does not specify the number of patterns. Document [1] discusses the root and canal morphology of mandibular molars in a Sri Lankan population, but it does not provide information about the patterns of accessory canals. Document [2] focuses on the prevalence and characteristics of accessory canals in the pulpal floor of deciduous molars, which is not relevant to the question. Document [3] investigates the apical anatomy of C-shaped root canal systems in mandibular second molars, but it does not mention accessory canals. Document [4] discusses the root canal configuration and the prevalence of C-shaped canals in mandibular second molars in an Iranian population, but it does not provide information about accessory canals. Document [5] examines the location and incidence of accessory pulpal canals in periodontal pockets, which is not relevant to the question. Document [6] investigates the detection and negotiation of accessory mesial canals in mandibular molars using magnifying loupes or the operating microscope, but it does not mention the number of patterns of accessory canals. Document [7] focuses on the root canal morphology and configuration of mandibular first molars, but it does not provide information about accessory canals. Document [8] studies the structure, distribution, and formation of accessory canals in the developing and mature molar teeth of rat mandibular jaws, which is not relevant to the question. Document [9] assesses the anatomy of mandibular first molars, but it does not mention accessory canals. Document [10] discusses the occurrence of accessory mandibular canals, but it does not specify the number of patterns in mandibular molars. Document [11] reviews the presence of accessory roots in maxillary molar teeth, which is not relevant to the question. Document [12] examines the variability of roots and root canal systems in mandibular molars, but it does not provide information about accessory canals. Document [13] investigates the characteristics of accessory mental foramina, which is not relevant to the question. Document [14] studies the symmetry of root and root canal morphology in maxillary and mandibular molars, but it does not mention accessory canals. Document [15] focuses on the diagnosis, classification, and frequency of C-shaped canals in mandibular second molars, which is not relevant to the question. Document [16] explores the frequency of middle mesial canals in mandibular first molars, but it does not provide information about accessory canals. Document [17] presents clinical reports and in vitro studies of mandibular molars with three canals in the mesial root, but it does not mention accessory canals. Document [18] observes the frequency, location, and direction of accessory, secondary, and lateral canals, but it does not specify the number of patterns in mandibular molars. Document [19] assesses the number of accessory or nutrient canals in the human mandible, but it does not focus on mandibular molars. Document [20] discusses the management of mandibular molars with accessory mesial canals, but it does not mention the number of patterns. Document [21] assesses the variability and morphological features of the root canal system and their ramifications, but it does not specify the number of patterns in mandibular molars. Document [22] investigates the root canal configuration of mandibular first molars in a Taiwan Chinese population, but it does not provide information about accessory canals. Document [23] presents case reports of mandibular molars with five canals, which is not relevant to the question. Document [24] describes the asymmetry in mesial root number and morphology in mandibular second molars, but it does not mention accessory canals. Document [25] investigates the prevalence, location, and patency of accessory canals in the furcation region of permanent molars, but it does not specify the number of patterns in mandibular molars. Document [26] assesses the internal morphology and root canal configuration of non C-shaped mandibular second molars, but it does not mention accessory canals. Document [27] studies the root canal morphology of mandibular permanent molars at different ages, but it does not provide information about accessory canals. Document [28] determines the prevalence and morphometric analysis of three-rooted mandibular first molars in a Brazilian subpopulation, but it does not mention accessory canals. Document [29] evaluates the anatomical features of C-shaped canal systems in Chinese mandibular second molars, but it does not provide information about accessory canals. Document [30] explores the incidence and characteristics of mandibular accessory canals, but it does not specify the number of patterns in mandibular molars. Document [31] investigates the root canal morphology of permanent maxillary and mandibular canines, which is not relevant to the question. Based on the analysis of the relevant documents, none of them provide information about the number of patterns of Accessory Canals in mandibular molars. Therefore, the answer to the question is unknown.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unknown\"}"
