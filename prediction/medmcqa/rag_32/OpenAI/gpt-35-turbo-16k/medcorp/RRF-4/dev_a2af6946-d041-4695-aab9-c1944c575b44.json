    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the repair mechanisms involved in CRISPR-Cas9 system. Document [1] states that the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system involves three steps: recognition, cleavage, and repair. The repair step can be carried out by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanisms. Document [6] also mentions that the accuracy and efficiency of genome editing in CRISPR-Cas9 are influenced by the cellular DNA repair pathways, which include homologous recombination (HR), classical nonhomologous end joining (cNHEJ), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and single-strand annealing (SSA). Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Homologous repair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
