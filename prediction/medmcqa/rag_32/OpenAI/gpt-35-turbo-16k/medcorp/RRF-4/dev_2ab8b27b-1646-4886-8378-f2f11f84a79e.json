    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Coagulative necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs due to ischemia or infarction. It is characterized by the preservation of tissue architecture for at least a couple of days. From the given options, we need to identify the acid that does not show coagulative necrosis on contact. According to the documents, acids with a pH of less than 2 induce coagulative necrosis. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A (HC1) and D (HNO3) as they have a pH less than 2. Now, we need to determine if H2SO4 (option B) or HF (option C) would show coagulative necrosis. Unfortunately, the documents do not provide specific information about the coagulative necrosis caused by these two acids. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine which acid does not show coagulative necrosis on contact. \", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
