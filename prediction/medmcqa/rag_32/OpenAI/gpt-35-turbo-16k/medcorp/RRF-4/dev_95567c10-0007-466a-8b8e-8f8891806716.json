    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Purkinje fibers are part of the cerebellar circuit and provide the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. They receive input from climbing fibers and parallel fibers and integrate them into a signal. The output of Purkinje cells is routed via the deep cerebellar nuclei to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, where it feeds into the motor cortex's ongoing actions. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Ventero lateral nucleus of thalamus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
