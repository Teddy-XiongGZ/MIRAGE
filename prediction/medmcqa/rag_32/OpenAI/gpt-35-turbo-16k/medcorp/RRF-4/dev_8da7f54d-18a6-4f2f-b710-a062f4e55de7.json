    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the type of pin used in pin restoration of a root canal treated tooth, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] mentions the use of intra-crown pins, which can be of amalgam or pre-fabricated metal. Document [4] states that pins and posts retain restorations and protect remaining tooth structure, and that a parallel, serrated, cemented device is the ideal combination. Document [5] discusses the use of pins to support amalgam or cast gold restorations. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the pin used in pin restoration of a root canal treated tooth can be either a cemented pin or a self-threading pin. Therefore, the answer is D. Any of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
