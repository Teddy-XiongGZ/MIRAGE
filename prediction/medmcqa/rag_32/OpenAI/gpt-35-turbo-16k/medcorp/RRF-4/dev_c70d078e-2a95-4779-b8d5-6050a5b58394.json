    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the minimum concentration of oxygen needed in NO analgesia. To find the answer, we need to search for information about NO analgesia and its oxygen requirements in the provided documents. Document [4] mentions that nitrous oxide (NO) is a weak general anesthetic and is generally not used alone in general anesthesia, but used as a carrier gas (mixed with oxygen) for more powerful general anesthetic drugs. However, this document does not provide specific information about the minimum concentration of oxygen needed in NO analgesia. Document [7] mentions that inhaled NO is used for pulmonary hypertension, acute hypoxemia, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but it does not provide information about the minimum concentration of oxygen needed. Document [11] discusses the use of inhaled NO in patients with acute hypoxia, but it does not provide specific information about the minimum concentration of oxygen needed. Based on the available information, none of the documents provide a direct answer to the question. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the minimum concentration of oxygen needed in NO analgesia from the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information to determine the answer\"}"
