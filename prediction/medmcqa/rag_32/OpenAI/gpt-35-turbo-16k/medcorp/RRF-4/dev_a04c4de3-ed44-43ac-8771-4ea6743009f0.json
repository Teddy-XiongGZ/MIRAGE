    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given that the substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme, we can assume that the enzyme is saturated with substrate. After 9 minutes of reaction, 170 substrate is converted to product. If the concentration of the enzyme is changed to 1/3 and the concentration of substrate is doubled, the reaction rate will change. To find the new time taken to convert the substrate into the same amount of product (12 microgram/ml), we need to calculate the new reaction rate and then determine the time required to reach the desired product concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 27 minutes\"}"
