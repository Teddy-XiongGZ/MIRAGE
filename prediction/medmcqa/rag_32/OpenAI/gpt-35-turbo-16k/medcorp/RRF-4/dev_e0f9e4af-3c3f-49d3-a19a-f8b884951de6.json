    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the recommended ratio of chest compressions and breaths when a lone person is giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is 30:02:00. This means 30 chest compressions followed by 2 breaths. Document [1] states that the current recommended ratio of chest compressions-breaths is 30:2. Document [10] also mentions that compression-only CPR, which involves chest compressions without artificial ventilation, is recommended as the method of choice for the untrained rescuer or those who are not proficient, and the ratio is 30:2. Therefore, the answer is D. 30:02:00.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 30:02:00\"}"
