    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the advantage of metal base denture, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [4] mentions that metal base dentures were produced at Tsurumi University Dental Hospital, with advantages including improved stability, phonation, and mastication. Document [8] states that metal reinforcement of the denture base can substantially reduce the incidence of fracture. Document [12] describes a technique for designing a mandibular denture with a cast metal denture base, which provides stability and function for patients with severely resorbed alveolar ridges. Document [24] discusses the use of cast metal bases as an economical alternative for patients with ridge resorption. Based on this information, the advantage of metal base denture is likely to be increased stability and durability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
