    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, direct impact on the bone can result in different types of fractures depending on the specific circumstances. The documents mention various fracture patterns such as butterfly fractures, oblique radiating lines, double butterfly pattern, false butterfly fragments, double trapezoid fragments, and wedge-shaped fragments. However, none of the documents specifically mention transverse, oblique, spiral, or comminuted fractures resulting from direct impact on the bone. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact type of fracture that will be produced by direct impact on the bone based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot determine\"}"
