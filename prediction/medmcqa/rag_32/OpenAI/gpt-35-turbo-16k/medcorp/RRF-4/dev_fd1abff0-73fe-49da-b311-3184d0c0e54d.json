    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a patient presents with altered sensorium, it is important to consider various potential causes and perform appropriate diagnostic tests. In this case, the question asks which test should NOT be done. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Complete blood counts: Complete blood counts can provide valuable information about the patient's overall health and can help identify any abnormalities that may be contributing to the altered sensorium. Therefore, it is a relevant test and should be done.\\n\\nB. Random blood sugar: Altered sensorium can be caused by hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Therefore, checking the blood sugar level is important to rule out any glucose abnormalities. This test should be done.\\n\\nC. Lumbar puncture: Lumbar puncture is typically performed when meningitis is suspected as a cause of altered sensorium. While it may not be necessary in all cases, it is still a relevant test that should be considered depending on the clinical presentation. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\\n\\nD. Non-contrast CT head: A non-contrast CT head is commonly performed in patients with altered sensorium to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or intracranial pathology. This test is important in ruling out any acute brain injury or other conditions that may require immediate intervention. Therefore, it is a relevant test and should be done.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the test that should NOT be done in this case is the lumbar puncture. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
