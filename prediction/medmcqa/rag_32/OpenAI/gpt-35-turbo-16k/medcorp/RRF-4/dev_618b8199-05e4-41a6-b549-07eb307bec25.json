    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a persistent productive cough and clubbing, along with wheeze and crackles on auscultation. These findings are suggestive of a respiratory condition. To confirm the diagnosis, the most specific investigation would be HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography). HRCT provides detailed images of the lungs and can help identify specific abnormalities associated with various respiratory conditions, including bronchiectasis, interstitial lung diseases, and bronchiolitis. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage may be considered in certain cases to obtain samples for further analysis, but it is not the most specific investigation for confirming the diagnosis in this scenario. Chest X-ray can provide initial information but may not be as sensitive or specific as HRCT. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is not typically used as a first-line investigation for respiratory conditions and may not provide the same level of detail as HRCT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
