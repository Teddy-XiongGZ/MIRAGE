    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In order to determine when hypotension occurs in hemorrhagic shock, we need to find information about the relationship between blood loss and the onset of hypotension. Looking at the relevant documents, Document [6] provides information about the different classes of hemorrhagic shock based on volume loss. According to Document [6], Class 1 hemorrhagic shock is characterized by volume loss up to 15% of total blood volume, and there is typically no change in blood pressure. Therefore, we can conclude that hypotension occurs when blood loss is more than 15% of total blood volume. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. 15% - 30%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
