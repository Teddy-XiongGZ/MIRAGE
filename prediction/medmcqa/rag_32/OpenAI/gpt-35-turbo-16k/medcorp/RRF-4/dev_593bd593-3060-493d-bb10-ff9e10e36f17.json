    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine when exchange transfusion is indicated in Rh isoimmunisation, we need to review the relevant documents for any information regarding the criteria for exchange transfusion. Document [0] discusses the management programme for Rh alloimmunization during pregnancy and mentions that exchange transfusion was performed in severe cases. Document [1] also mentions the use of exchange transfusion in cases of massive D+ mismatch. Document [5] describes a case of severe Rh alloimmunization where exchange transfusion was performed. Based on this information, it can be inferred that exchange transfusion is indicated in severe cases of Rh isoimmunization. None of the documents specifically mention the criteria of cord blood hemoglobin, cord bilirubin, or history of previous sibling affected as indications for exchange transfusion. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of these.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
