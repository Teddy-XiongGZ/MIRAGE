    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 75-year-old chronic smoker with diabetes and edentulous for the last 30 years. The best treatment modality for a bilateral body fracture in this patient would depend on the specific location and severity of the fracture. However, considering the patient's age, chronic smoking, and diabetes, which may affect bone healing and increase the risk of complications, a more stable fixation method would be preferred.
