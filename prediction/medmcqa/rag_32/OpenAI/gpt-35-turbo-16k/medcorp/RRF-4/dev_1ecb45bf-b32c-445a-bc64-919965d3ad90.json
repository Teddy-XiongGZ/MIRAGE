    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Submental intubation is described as an alternative to tracheostomy in the management of patients with severe midfacial fractures. It is used when surgical access to both the nasal and oral cavities is necessary. The technique allows for intraoperative maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) while maintaining a secure airway. Based on the information provided in the documents, submental intubation is indicated in cases of panfacial fractures, which involve fractures of the jaws disturbing the dental occlusion plus either an associated fracture of the skull base or a displaced nasal fracture.
