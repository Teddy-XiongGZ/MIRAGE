    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The likely explanation for the bradycardia in this case is the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex is a cardioinhibitory reflex that occurs in response to increased ventricular filling and is characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and vasodilation. It is commonly observed in patients with subarachnoid block due to the sympathetic blockade and the resulting unopposed parasympathetic activity. The level of block at T6 suggests that the sympathetic blockade has affected the cardioaccelerator fibers, leading to bradycardia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
