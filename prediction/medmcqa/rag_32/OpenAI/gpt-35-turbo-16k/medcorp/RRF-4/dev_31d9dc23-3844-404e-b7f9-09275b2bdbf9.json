    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PDA is a heart defect where the ductus arteriosus, a fetal blood vessel, remains open after birth. It can cause various symptoms and complications. To determine which of the given options is least likely in PDA, we need to consider the characteristics and effects of PDA. A. CO, wash out: PDA can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, which can cause increased cardiac output and wash out of carbon dioxide. This makes option A likely in PDA. B. Necrotizing enterocolitis: Necrotizing enterocolitis is a gastrointestinal condition that primarily affects premature infants. While PDA and necrotizing enterocolitis can both occur in premature infants, they are separate conditions and not directly related. Therefore, option B is not directly associated with PDA. C. Bounding pulse: PDA can cause a bounding pulse due to the increased blood flow through the ductus arteriosus. This makes option C likely in PDA. D. Pulmonary hemorrhage: Pulmonary hemorrhage is not a direct consequence of PDA. While PDA can cause increased blood flow to the lungs, it does not directly lead to pulmonary hemorrhage. Therefore, option D is least likely in PDA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
