    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, porosity in methyl methacrylate resin is more likely to occur near the borders of the denture. This is supported by Document [3], which states that the highest numbers of pores occurred in unfilled heat-polymerized acrylic resin, which is similar to methyl methacrylate resin, and that most of the pores were less than 50 micron diameter. Porosity near the borders is a common issue in denture fabrication and can be caused by factors such as inadequate packing of the resin, improper flasking technique, or inadequate pressure during polymerization. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Near the borders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
