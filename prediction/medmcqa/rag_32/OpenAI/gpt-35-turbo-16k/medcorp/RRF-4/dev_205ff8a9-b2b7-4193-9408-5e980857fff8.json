    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The creation of an apical stop to prevent extrusion of matrix beyond the apex is called apexification. Apexification is a procedure used to induce a calcified barrier at the apex of a nonvital tooth with incomplete root formation. It involves the use of materials such as calcium hydroxide or mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) to promote the formation of an apical barrier. The apical barrier acts as a stop to prevent the extrusion of filling materials during obturation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
