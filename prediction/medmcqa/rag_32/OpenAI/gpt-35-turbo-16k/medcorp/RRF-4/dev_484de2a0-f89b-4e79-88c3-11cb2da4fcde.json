    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times, we need to calculate the 95% confidence interval. The formula for the confidence interval is: CI = X\u0304 \u00b1 Z * (\u03c3/\u221an), where X\u0304 is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 95% corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96), \u03c3 is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size. In this case, X\u0304 = 30, Z = 1.96, \u03c3 = 1.0, and n = 100. Plugging in these values, we get: CI = 30 \u00b1 1.96 * (1.0/\u221a100) = 30 \u00b1 1.96 * 0.1 = 30 \u00b1 0.196. Therefore, the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times is 30 - 0.196 = 29.804.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
