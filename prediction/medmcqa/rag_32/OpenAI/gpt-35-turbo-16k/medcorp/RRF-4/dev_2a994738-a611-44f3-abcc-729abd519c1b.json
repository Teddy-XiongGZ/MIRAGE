    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, benzoyl peroxide is used as a radical initiator in the polymerization of acrylic resin. The temperature at which benzoyl peroxide forms free radicals during polymerization is not explicitly mentioned in the documents. However, it is mentioned that benzoyl peroxide is used as an initiator for radical polymerization at elevated temperatures. Therefore, we can infer that the temperature at which benzoyl peroxide forms free radicals during polymerization of acrylic resin is likely to be higher than room temperature. Based on the options provided, the most reasonable choice would be D. 60\u00b0C, as it is a higher temperature that falls within the range of elevated temperatures mentioned in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
