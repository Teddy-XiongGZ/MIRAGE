    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In prokaryotes, the mRNA is bound to the ribosome through the Shine Dalgarno sequence. This sequence is located upstream of the start codon on the mRNA and is recognized by the 16S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit. The binding of the Shine Dalgarno sequence ensures that the ribosome is properly aligned with the mRNA and the initiation codon is placed in the correct position. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Shine Dalgarno sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
