    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which type of OKC is more aggressive and has more recurrence potential, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is a locally aggressive, cystic jaw lesion with a putative high growth potential and a propensity for recurrence. Document [4] mentions that the parakeratinized odontogenic keratocyst (POC) is considered to be more aggressive and has a high recurrence rate. Therefore, based on the information from these documents, the answer is B. Parakeratinized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
