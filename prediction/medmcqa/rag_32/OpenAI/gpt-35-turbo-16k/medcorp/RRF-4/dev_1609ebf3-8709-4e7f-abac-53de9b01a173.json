    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to refer to the relevant document, which is Document [1] (Comparison between characteristics of severe and very severe aortic stenosis). This document provides information about the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and very severe AS. We need to find out what is seen in severe AS. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Pulsus bisferiens: Pulsus bisferiens refers to a double-peaked arterial pulse waveform, which is not specific to AS.\\n\\nB. Late ejection systolic click: A late ejection systolic click is associated with mitral valve prolapse, not AS.\\n\\nC. Heaving shifted apex: A heaving shifted apex is a characteristic finding in aortic regurgitation, not AS.\\n\\nD. Loud S2: A loud S2, also known as a paradoxical splitting of S2, is a characteristic finding in AS due to delayed closure of the aortic valve.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is D. Loud S2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
