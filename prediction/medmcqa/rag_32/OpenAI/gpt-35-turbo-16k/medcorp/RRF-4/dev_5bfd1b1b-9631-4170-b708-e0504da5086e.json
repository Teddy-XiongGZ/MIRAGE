    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a chronic alcoholic presenting with severe epigastric pain and vomiting, which raises suspicion for acute pancreatitis. The presence of guarding in the upper epigastrium suggests peritonitis, which is a complication of acute pancreatitis. Chest X-ray being normal does not provide any specific information about the cause of the symptoms. The next best step would be to order a serum lipase test, as elevated lipase levels are a diagnostic marker for acute pancreatitis. Upper GI endoscopy would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as it is more commonly used to evaluate upper gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes of epigastric pain. Alcohol breath test would not provide any additional information about the patient's current condition. CECT (contrast-enhanced computed tomography) may be considered if the diagnosis remains uncertain or if complications of acute pancreatitis are suspected, but it is not the most immediate next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
