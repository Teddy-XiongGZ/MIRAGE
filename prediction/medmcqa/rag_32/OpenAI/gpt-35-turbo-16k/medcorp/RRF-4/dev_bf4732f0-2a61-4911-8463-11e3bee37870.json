    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, the primary action of topical fluoride is the formation of a reservoir in saliva. Document [8] states that the effectiveness of fluoride as a cariostatic agent depends on the availability of free fluoride in plaque during cariogenic challenge, and a constant supply of low levels of fluoride in biofilm/saliva/dental interference is considered the most beneficial in preventing dental caries. This suggests that topical fluoride forms a reservoir in saliva, providing a constant supply of fluoride ions. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Form a reservoir in saliva.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
