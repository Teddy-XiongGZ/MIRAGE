    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Supplementary retention on the abutment tooth can be achieved through various methods. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Greater bulk of metal: This option refers to the amount of metal used in the restoration, which may contribute to overall retention but does not specifically address supplementary retention on the abutment tooth.\\n\\nB. Proper cementation technique: This option suggests that the way the restoration is cemented onto the abutment tooth can contribute to supplementary retention.\\n\\nC. Shoulder preparation: This option refers to the preparation of a shoulder on the abutment tooth, which can provide additional retention for the restoration.\\n\\nD. Proper use of pins and grooves: This option suggests that the use of pins and grooves on the abutment tooth can enhance supplementary retention.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, options B, C, and D seem to be more relevant to achieving supplementary retention on the abutment tooth. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the most accurate answer. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B/C/D\"}"
