    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the true statement regarding the conversion of monomer to polymer. To determine the correct answer, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [28] discusses the influence of monomer composition on the degree of conversion (DC) of dental resins. It states that the time and quantity of the photochemical initiation system can influence the physical-mechanical properties of the resins as well as the monomers in their composition. However, there is no specific information about density changes or volume shrinkage. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
