    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which alloy has the highest surface roughness, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. The surface roughness of different alloys is influenced by various factors such as the manufacturing process, surface treatment, and composition. We can look for information on surface roughness in the documents that discuss the alloys mentioned in the question. By comparing the information, we can identify the alloy with the highest surface roughness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. NiTi\"}"
