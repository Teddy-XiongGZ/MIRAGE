    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the true statements about microalbuminuria. \\n\\n1. Urine protein levels range from 20 mg/d to 200 mg/d: This statement is true. Document [4] states that microalbuminuria is defined as a persistent elevation of albumin in the urine of >30 to <300 mg/d or >20 to <200 microg/min.\\n\\n2. It is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity in diabetic patients: This statement is true. Document [27] mentions that microalbuminuria is associated with a high rate of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and increased morbidity and mortality.\\n\\n3. It is the earliest marker of diabetic nephropathy: This statement is not supported by the provided documents. While microalbuminuria is highly predictive of the development of diabetic nephropathy, it is not specifically mentioned as the earliest marker.\\n\\n4. It is not detected by routine dipstick method: This statement is not supported by the provided documents. Document [3] mentions that microalbuminuria can be detected using urine dipsticks specifically designed to detect albumin.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the true statements about microalbuminuria are A. Urine protein levels range from 20 mg/d to 200 mg/d and B. It is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity in diabetic patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
