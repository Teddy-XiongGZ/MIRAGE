    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the method for diagnosing Clostridium difficile infection, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [3] states that real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of toxin genes is the most effective diagnostic method for accurate and early diagnosis of CDI. Document [6] also mentions that nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as PCR, are very sensitive and promising methods for detecting C. difficile toxins. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Toxin gene detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
