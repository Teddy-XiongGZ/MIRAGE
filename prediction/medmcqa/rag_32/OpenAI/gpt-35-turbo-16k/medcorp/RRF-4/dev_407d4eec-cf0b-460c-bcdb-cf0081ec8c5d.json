    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, methacholine acts as a non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist. It stimulates the muscarinic receptors in the airway, leading to bronchoconstriction and increased tracheobronchial secretions. The relevant documents mention the involvement of M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes in the effects of methacholine. However, there is no specific information indicating the involvement of the M4 receptor subtype. Therefore, the answer is either A. M1, B. M2, or C. M3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/C\"}"
