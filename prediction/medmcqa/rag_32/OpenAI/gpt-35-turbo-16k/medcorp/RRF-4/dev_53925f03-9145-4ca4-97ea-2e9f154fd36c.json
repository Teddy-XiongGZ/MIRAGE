    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common organism found in retreatment cases of periapical abscess, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [0] provides information on the microbial profile of periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth and those that had received root canal retreatment. According to this document, the most commonly detected species in all groups, including retreatment cases, is Parvimonas micra. Therefore, the answer is not A. E. faecalis. There is no information in the provided documents about Treponema denticola or Streptococcus mutans being commonly found in retreatment cases of periapical abscess. However, Document [9] mentions that Actinomyces can be associated with periapical actinomycosis, which is a type of periapical abscess. Therefore, the most common organism found in retreatment cases of periapical abscess is likely D. Actinomyces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
