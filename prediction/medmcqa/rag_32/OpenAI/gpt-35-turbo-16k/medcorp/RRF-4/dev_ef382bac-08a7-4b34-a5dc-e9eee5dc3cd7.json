    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine why Isosorbide 5-mononitrate is preferred, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the long-acting form of Isosorbide-5-mononitrate provides sufficient antianginal effect throughout the day and is better tolerated than Isosorbide dinitrate. Document [2] mentions that the once-daily Isosorbide mononitrate IR-SR has a rapid onset of action and has been shown to be clinically efficient and, in addition, to be more so than conventional ISMN/ISDN. Document [10] also states that the antianginal effects of once-daily Isosorbide mononitrate EL were generally similar to those of conventional ISMN/ISDN. Based on this information, it can be concluded that Isosorbide 5-mononitrate is preferred because it has a longer duration of action and is better tolerated, indicating that less tolerance develops.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
