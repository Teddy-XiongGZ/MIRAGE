    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the difference between the typical cervical and thoracic vertebrae, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the typical cervical vertebrae have bifid spinous processes, while Document [10] mentions that the cervical vertebrae have a ventral vertebral body with mostly trabecular (cancellous) bone. Document [14] adds that the cervical vertebrae have one foramen in each transverse process, except for C7. Document [15] states that the cervical vertebrae have superior articular facets that face posteromedially. Finally, Document [28] mentions that all mammals, including humans, have seven cervical vertebrae. Based on this information, we can conclude that the typical cervical vertebrae differ from thoracic vertebrae in having bifid spinous processes, a ventral vertebral body with mostly trabecular bone, one foramen in each transverse process (except for C7), and superior articular facets that face posteromedially. Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
