    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anti-epileptic drug is not associated with congenital malformation when used in pregnant women, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [17] states that lamotrigine and levetiracetam, which are newer generation anti-epileptic drugs, were not associated with a significant increased risk of congenital malformations compared to control. Document [27] also mentions that lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine are relatively safe. On the other hand, Document [0] states that valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing age as it is associated with the highest risk of neurocognitive malformations. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Valproate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
