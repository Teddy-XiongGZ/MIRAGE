    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the amount of fluid to be replenished, we need to use a formula that takes into account the patient's weight and the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) burned. The Parkland formula is commonly used for fluid resuscitation in burn patients. According to the Parkland formula, the recommended fluid volume is 4 mL/kg x %TBSA. In this case, the patient arrived 8 hours after sustaining burns, so the fluid should be administered over the next 16 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 4 mL/kg x %TBSA in the first 8 hours followed by 2 mL/kg/hour x %TBSA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
