    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a hearing impairment resulting from exposure to loud sound. It can cause a loss of perception of a narrow range of frequencies or impaired perception of sound, including sensitivity to sound or ringing in the ears. NIHL occurs when loud sound overstimulates delicate hearing cells, leading to permanent injury or death of the cells. Based on this information, the answer to the question is either the inner hair cell or the outer hair cell, as these are the delicate cells in the inner ear that are responsible for detecting sound vibrations. To determine the correct answer, we need to find more specific information about which type of hair cell is affected by noise-induced hearing loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
