    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, proteinuria is one of the essential criteria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia. However, the amount of proteinuria is not consistently associated with the severity of preeclampsia. Document [3] states that the classic cutoff to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of >300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. Document [7] mentions that a random urine protein-creatinine ratio (uPCR) value of \u22650.3 indicates abnormal proteinuria in preeclampsia with renal damage. Based on this information, the level of proteinuria to diagnose severe preeclampsia is 300 mg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
