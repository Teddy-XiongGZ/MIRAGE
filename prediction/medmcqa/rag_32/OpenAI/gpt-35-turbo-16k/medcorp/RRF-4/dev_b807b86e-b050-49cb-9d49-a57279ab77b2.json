    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the meaning of a CPITN index zero score, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [3] states that the CPITN index will give a correct estimate of bleeding. However, Document [0] mentions that none of the sextants had a CPITN score of 0 or 1, indicating that a CPITN index zero score does not represent gingival bleeding. Document [2] states that the CPITN index identified higher proportions of adults and teeth with a healthy periodontal condition. Therefore, based on the information provided, a CPITN index zero score most likely means a healthy tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Healthy tooth\"}"
