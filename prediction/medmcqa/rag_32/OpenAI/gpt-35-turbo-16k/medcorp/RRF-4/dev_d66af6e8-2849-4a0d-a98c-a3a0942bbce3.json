    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cyanotic spells in Tetralogy of Fallot are triggered by crying and can be treated with various drugs. To determine which drug to avoid, we need to consider the mechanism of action of each drug and its potential effects on the cardiovascular system. Sodium bicarbonate is not typically used to treat cyanotic spells in Tetralogy of Fallot, so it is unlikely to be the drug to avoid. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to treat Tet spells, so it is not the drug to avoid. Phenylephrine is a vasopressor that increases systemic vascular resistance, which can help increase blood flow to the lungs and improve oxygenation. Isoprenaline is a beta-agonist that can increase heart rate and contractility, which can also improve oxygenation. Given that the cyanotic spell is initiated by crying, it is important to avoid drugs that can further decrease systemic vascular resistance, as this can worsen the shunting of blood from the right to left side of the heart. Therefore, the drug to avoid in this case would be C. Phenylephrine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
