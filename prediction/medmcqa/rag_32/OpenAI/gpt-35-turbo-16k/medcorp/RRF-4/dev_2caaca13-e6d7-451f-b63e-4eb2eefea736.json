    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that the median lethal dose of methanol is typically 100 ml (1-2 ml/kg body weight of pure methanol). This contradicts option B, which states that the minimum lethal dose of methanol is 1.25 ml/kg body weight. Therefore, option B is NOT true for methanol poisoning. Options A, C, and D are supported by the information in the documents. Fomepizole is indeed a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (not aldehyde dehydrogenase), formic acid is responsible for the toxicity of methanol, and methanol can cause snow field vision. Therefore, the answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
