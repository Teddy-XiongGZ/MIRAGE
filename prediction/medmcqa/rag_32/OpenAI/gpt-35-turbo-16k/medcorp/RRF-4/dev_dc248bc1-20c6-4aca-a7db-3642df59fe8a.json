    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which of the following is activated by intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. From the provided documents, we can find information about apoptosis, which is a programmed cell death process. Document [4] states that apoptosis can be initiated through two pathways: the intrinsic pathway (also called the mitochondrial pathway) and the extrinsic pathway. Both pathways activate caspases, which are proteases that degrade proteins. Therefore, the answer to the question is B. Apoptosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
