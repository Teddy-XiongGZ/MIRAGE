    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The curve that passes through the cusps of all the posteriors and reaches the condyle is known as the Curve of Spee. This curve is defined as the curvature of the mandibular occlusal plane beginning at the canine and following the buccal cusps of the posterior teeth, continuing to the terminal molar. It is named after Ferdinand Graf von Spee, who first described the anatomic relations of human teeth in the sagittal plane. The Curve of Wilson is the across arch curvature or posterior occlusal plane, and it is defined by a line drawn from the left mandibular first molar to the right mandibular first molar. The Anti monsoon curve and Monsoon curve are not relevant to dental occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Curve of spee\"}"
