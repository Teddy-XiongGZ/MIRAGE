    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the maturation of enamel continues after eruption into the oral cavity. Document [2] states that immediately after eruption, tooth enamel loses a certain amount of minerals, which explains the high dental caries in the first few years after eruption. Document [16] mentions that the mineralization level in the outer surface of human enamel continues for more than 5 years after eruption. Therefore, the additional period required for enamel calcification after eruption into the oral cavity is more than 5 years. None of the given answer choices match this timeframe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
