    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with brown coloured urine, oliguria, facial puffiness, pedal edema, 3+ proteinuria, RBCs 100/hpf, and granular casts. These findings are consistent with nephritic syndrome. Minimal change disease typically presents with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, and does not typically present with hematuria or RBC casts. Membranous glomerulonephritis is also associated with nephrotic syndrome and does not typically present with hematuria or RBC casts. FSGS can present with nephrotic syndrome or nephritic syndrome, but in this case, the presence of RBCs and granular casts suggests a nephritic syndrome presentation. IgA nephropathy, also known as Berger's disease, is a common cause of glomerulonephritis and is characterized by the presence of IgA deposits in the glomeruli. It typically presents with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria, often following an upper respiratory tract infection. Given the patient's presentation of brown coloured urine, oliguria, and the presence of RBCs and granular casts, IgA nephropathy is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
