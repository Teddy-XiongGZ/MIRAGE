    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"For >10 mm setback of mandible, the most suitable surgery would be a body osteotomy with extraction of premolars. This is because a body osteotomy allows for a larger amount of setback compared to other types of osteotomies. Additionally, the extraction of premolars can help create space for the desired setback. Sagittal split ramus osteotomy and vertical ramus osteotomy may not provide enough setback for >10 mm. Subapical osteotomy is typically used for anterior mandibular setback and may not be suitable for >10 mm setback.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
