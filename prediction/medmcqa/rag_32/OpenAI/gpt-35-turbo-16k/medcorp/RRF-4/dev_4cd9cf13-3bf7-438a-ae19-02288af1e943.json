    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the patient is experiencing massive blood loss and requires both packed red blood cells (PRBC) and platelets. Since only one IV line is accessible, it is important to prioritize which blood product to transfuse first. Platelets are more sensitive to room temperature storage and should be transfused first. Therefore, the correct choice is to store the platelets at room temperature (option A) and transfuse the PRBC. This ensures that the platelets remain viable and effective for transfusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
