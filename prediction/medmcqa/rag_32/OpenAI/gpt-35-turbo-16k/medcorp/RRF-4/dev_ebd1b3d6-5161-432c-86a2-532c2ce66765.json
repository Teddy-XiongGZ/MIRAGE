    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine what is not true regarding Japanese encephalitis vaccine, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [9] states that there are currently three vaccines available for Japanese encephalitis: SA14-14-2, IXIARO (IC51), and ChimeriVax-JE. Document [25] mentions that the inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine (JE-MB) is no longer available. Document [27] states that four types of JE vaccines are currently used: live attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine, inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine (JE-MB), inactivated Vero cell culture vaccine (JE-VC), and live attenuated chimeric vaccine (IMOJEV). Document [28] mentions the introduction of live attenuated SA-14-14-2 vaccine in the routine immunization program for children in India. Document [29] discusses the clinical development of IMOJEV, a recombinant Japanese encephalitis chimeric vaccine. Based on this information, we can determine the answer to the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
