    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, we can determine the likely hormone X by analyzing the information related to the localization of hormone receptors. Document [3] states that steroid hormone receptors, including estrogen and 3-ketosteroids, are generally intracellular receptors found in the nucleus, cytosol, and plasma membrane of target cells. Document [4] also mentions that steroid hormone receptors are generally intracellular receptors, typically cytoplasmic or nuclear, and initiate signal transduction for steroid hormones which lead to changes in gene expression. Therefore, based on this information, it is likely that hormone X is a steroid hormone. Among the given choices, the only steroid hormone is Thyroxine (choice C). Therefore, the answer is C. Thyroxine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
