    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, insulin requirement increases and cannot be provided with sulphonylureas. This is true because sulphonylureas are not recommended for use in pregnancy due to their potential teratogenic effects and long hypoglycemic periods. Insulin is the preferred treatment for pregnant women with diabetes. Insulin does not cross the placenta, so option A is true. Tolbutamide, a sulphonylurea, does cross the placenta, so option C is true. However, there is no information provided about tolbutamide causing PIH (pregnancy-induced hypertension), so option D cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, the answer is B. During pregnancy, insulin requirement increases and cannot be provided with sulphonylureas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
