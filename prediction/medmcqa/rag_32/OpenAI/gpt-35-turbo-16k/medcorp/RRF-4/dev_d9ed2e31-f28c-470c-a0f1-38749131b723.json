    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which features of the skull of a newborn are true, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] states that at birth, many regions of the newborn's skull have not yet been converted to bone, leaving 'soft spots' known as fontanels. This confirms that the anterior fontanelle is open in a newborn. Document [11] mentions that bone fusion occurs as part of the normal developmental process of the human skull, but disruptions can cause premature closure of cranial sutures, resulting in changes in skull growth patterns. This suggests that the diploe, which is the spongy layer of bone between the inner and outer layers of compact bone, may not be fully formed in a newborn. Document [28] discusses normal developmental variants of the skull base, including the styloid process and its variations. Therefore, it is possible that the styloid process has not fused with the rest of the temporal bone in a newborn. However, there is no specific information in the provided documents regarding the size of the mastoid process in a newborn. Based on this analysis, the answer choice that is not true is D. Mastoid process is of adult size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
