    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the fat content in the expressed breast milk of pre-term infants compared to term infants, the best study design would be a longitudinal study. A longitudinal study involves collecting data from the same participants over an extended period of time, which would allow for the comparison of fat content in breast milk at different time points for both pre-term and term infants. This design would provide valuable information on how the fat content changes over time in both groups and allow for a direct comparison between the two groups. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Longitudinal study\"}"
