    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement about tRNA molecules is false, we need to analyze each statement individually. \\n\\nStatement A: The enzyme that attaches an amino acid to a tRNA is aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. This statement is true. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is responsible for catalyzing the attachment of the correct amino acid to the corresponding tRNA molecule.\\n\\nStatement B: Although composed of a single strand of RNA, each molecule contains several sho, double-helical regions. This statement is false. tRNA molecules are composed of a single strand of RNA that folds upon itself to form a cloverleaf-like structure, but they do not contain double-helical regions.\\n\\nStatement C: The amino acid attachment is always to 3' end of the molecule. This statement is true. The amino acid is attached to the 3' end of the tRNA molecule through an ester bond.\\n\\nStatement D: There is at least one tRNA for each of the 2 amino acids. This statement is false. There are multiple tRNA molecules for each amino acid, allowing for redundancy and flexibility in the genetic code.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the false statement is statement B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
