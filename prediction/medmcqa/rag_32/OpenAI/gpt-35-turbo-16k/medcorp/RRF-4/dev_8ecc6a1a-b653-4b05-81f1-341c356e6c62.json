    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which change in insulin structure would result in the least change in function, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [5] discusses the structural interpretation of reduced insulin activity. It states that modifications near the N-terminal A-chain region, specifically the addition of an arginine at the N-terminal A-chain, can lead to variations in the biological activity of insulin. This suggests that changes in the A-chain region can have a significant impact on insulin function. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and C, which involve interchanging amino acids in the A-chain region. These changes are likely to have a noticeable effect on insulin function. Document [11] discusses insulin analogues, which are slight variations of the human insulin molecule designed to retain the hormone's glucose management functionality. It states that insulin analogues have absorption and activity characteristics not currently possible with subcutaneously injected insulin. This suggests that changes in the B-chain region, specifically in the amino acids B29 and B30, can be made without significantly altering insulin function. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. Interchange of B29 and B30.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
