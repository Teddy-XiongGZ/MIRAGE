    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the Turku sugar studies, which focused on the effects of different sugars on dental caries. The studies examined the impact of sucrose, fructose, and xylitol diets on caries incidence in humans. The studies found that xylitol consumption resulted in a significant reduction in caries increment, while fructose was found to be less cariogenic than sucrose. Therefore, the Turku sugar studies were specifically related to dental caries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dental Caries\"}"
