    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the patient has a history of massive hemoptysis and normal chest X-ray, further investigation is needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes of hemoptysis. Bronchial artery embolization (choice A) and pulmonary artery embolization (choice B) are both potential interventions to control bleeding and prevent hemoptysis. Bronchoscopic laser cauterization (choice C) is a treatment option to address specific lesions or bleeding sites in the bronchial tree. Lobectomy of the affected segment (choice D) is a surgical option to remove the source of bleeding. However, since the question asks for the option that is NOT done to prevent hemoptysis, the correct answer is D. Lobectomy of the affected segment is not typically done as a preventive measure for hemoptysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
