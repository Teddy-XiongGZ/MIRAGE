    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bending orthodontic wire at room temperature is an example of work/strain hardening. Work hardening, also known as strain hardening, is the process of increasing the hardness and strength of a material through plastic deformation, such as bending or twisting. This occurs because the deformation causes dislocations in the crystal structure of the material, which hinder the movement of other dislocations and increase the material's resistance to further deformation. Tempering, age hardening, and precipitation hardening are different processes that involve heat treatment and are not directly related to bending at room temperature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
