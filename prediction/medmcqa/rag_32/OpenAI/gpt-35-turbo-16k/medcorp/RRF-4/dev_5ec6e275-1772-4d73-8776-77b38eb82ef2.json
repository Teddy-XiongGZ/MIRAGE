    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which drug has gameticidal action against all species of Plasmodium, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that Primaquine is currently the only licensed drug with activity against the sexual stages of malaria parasites. However, it does not specify if Primaquine is effective against all species of Plasmodium. Document [4] mentions that antimalarial drugs have been reported to affect gametocyte production in vivo, but it does not provide specific information about the effectiveness of these drugs against all species of Plasmodium. Document [6] states that Pyronaridine has both schizontocidal and gametocytocidal activities against the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum. However, it does not mention if Pyronaridine is effective against all species of Plasmodium. Based on the available information, it is not clear which drug has gameticidal action against all species of Plasmodium. Therefore, the answer is D. None of these.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
