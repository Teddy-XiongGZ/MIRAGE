    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the 32-year-old P2L2 lady comes five days after unprotected sexual intercourse. To provide appropriate advice for contraception, we need to consider the available options and their effectiveness. A. Copper IUCD: Copper intrauterine contraceptive device is a highly effective long-acting reversible contraceptive method. It can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse and provides ongoing contraception for up to 10 years. This option is a suitable choice for the given scenario. B. Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg: Levonorgestrel emergency contraception (commonly known as the morning-after pill) is most effective when taken within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected intercourse. While it can be used up to 5 days after intercourse, its effectiveness decreases over time. Therefore, it may not be the most optimal choice in this case. C. Two tablets of high dose OCP, repeated after 24 hours: High-dose oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) can be used as emergency contraception when taken in specific doses and timing. However, the effectiveness of this method decreases over time, and it is generally recommended to be taken within 72 hours (3 days) after intercourse. Therefore, it may not be the most suitable choice in this scenario. D. Laparoscopic tubectomy: Laparoscopic tubectomy is a permanent surgical method of contraception. It is not appropriate for a woman seeking immediate contraception after recent unprotected intercourse. Considering the options and their effectiveness, the most appropriate advice for contraception in this lady would be A. Copper IUCD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
