    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the characteristics of Mantle cell Carcinoma, we need to find information about its immunophenotype. Looking through the relevant documents, we can find information about the immunophenotype of mantle cell lymphoma, which is a related condition. Document [2] states that the normal counterparts of the cells forming mantle cell lymphoma stain positively for CD5, CD20, cyclin D1, and FMC7 antibodies. Document [10] mentions that mantle cell lymphoma is characterized by overexpression of the cyclin D1 gene. Based on this information, we can conclude that mantle cell carcinoma would also show CD5 positivity and cyclin D1 overexpression. Therefore, the correct answer is CD 5+, CD 23-.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. CD 5+, CD 23-\"}"
