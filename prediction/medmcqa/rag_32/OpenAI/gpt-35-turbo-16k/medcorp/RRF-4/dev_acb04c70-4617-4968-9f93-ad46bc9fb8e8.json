    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The citric acid cycle begins with the condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to form citrate. Then, citrate goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two carboxyl groups as CO2. The carbons lost as CO2 originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The cycle ends with the regeneration of oxaloacetate. Therefore, the acid formed in the citric acid cycle is oxaloacetic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
