    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the flow rate of the drug solution, we need to determine the total dose of the drug in the solution and the time over which it will be infused. The patient's weight is 80 kg and the dose of the drug is 10 mcg/kg/min. So, the total dose of the drug per minute is 10 mcg/kg/min * 80 kg = 800 mcg/min. Each 5 mL ampule contains 200 mg of the drug, which is equivalent to 200,000 mcg. Therefore, the total dose of the drug in the 250 mL solution is 2 ampules * 200,000 mcg/ampule = 400,000 mcg. Assuming 16 drops = 1 mL, the total number of drops in the solution is 250 mL * 16 drops/mL = 4,000 drops. To calculate the flow rate, we divide the total dose of the drug by the total number of drops: 400,000 mcg / 4,000 drops = 100 mcg/drop. Since we want to administer the drug at a rate of 800 mcg/min, the flow rate should be 800 mcg/min / 100 mcg/drop = 8 drops/min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 8 drops/min\"}"
