    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the false statement about nasal fractures. Let's go through the statements one by one: \\n\\nA. Even if minor, they may be followed by bilateral ecchymosis and facial oedema - This statement is true. Nasal fractures, even if minor, can cause bilateral ecchymosis (bruising) and facial edema (swelling).\\n\\nB. They may need to be reduced for a few weeks - This statement is true. Nasal fractures may need to be reduced (realigned) and may require a few weeks for healing and stabilization.\\n\\nC. They need not be complicated by traumatic telecanthus - This statement is true. Traumatic telecanthus, which refers to the widening of the distance between the inner corners of the eyes, is not a common complication of nasal fractures.\\n\\nD. They may lead to the telescoping of the nasal complex into the frontal sinus - This statement is false. Nasal fractures do not typically lead to the telescoping of the nasal complex into the frontal sinus. This is not a recognized complication of nasal fractures.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the false statement is D. They may lead to the telescoping of the nasal complex into the frontal sinus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
