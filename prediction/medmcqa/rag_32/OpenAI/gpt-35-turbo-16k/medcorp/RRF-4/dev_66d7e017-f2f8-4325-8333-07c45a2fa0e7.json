    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, the innervation of stretch fibers in striated muscle is carried by gamma fibers. Document [4] states that intrafusal muscle fibers, which are the stretch fibers in muscle spindles, are innervated by gamma motor neurons. Gamma efferents from small multipolar neurons innervate the intrafusal muscle fibers. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Gamma fiber.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
