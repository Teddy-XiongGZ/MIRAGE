Based on the provided documents, the most common acute and late side effects observed in patients receiving pelvic external beam irradiation for endometrial carcinoma were gastrointestinal and genitourinary complications. The rectum and bladder are both part of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems, respectively.
