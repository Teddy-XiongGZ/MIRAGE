    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The depth of the clinical gingival sulcus is the distance between the gingival margin and another anatomical structure. To determine the correct answer, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that a healthy sulcular depth is three millimeters or less, which is readily self-cleansable with a properly used toothbrush or the supplemental use of other oral hygiene aids. Document [2] explains that the sulcular epithelium lines the gingival sulcus and is apically bounded by the junctional epithelium. Document [6] mentions that the junctional epithelium lies at the base of the gingival sulcus. Document [16] states that the gingival sulcus is a natural space that lies apically to the gingival margin. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is C. Apical extension of junctional epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
