    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, it is mentioned that drug transport across biological membranes involves both passive diffusion and carrier-mediated mechanisms. Document [0] states that both passive transcellular processes and carrier-mediated processes coexist and contribute to drug transport activities across biological membranes. Document [1] supports the existing consensus on the coexistence of transbilayer diffusion and carrier-mediated transport as two main mechanisms for drugs crossing biological membranes. Document [2] also mentions that transport mechanisms existing in biological membranes highly determine proper cellular functions and contribute to drug transport. Therefore, the major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes is a combination of passive diffusion and carrier-mediated transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Passive diffusion\"}"
