    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which milestone in a 3-year-old child should be called delayed development, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss developmental milestones and delays. Document [0] mentions that there is a wide range of what may be considered 'normal' development, but there are specific milestones that should be achieved by certain ages. Document [3] defines milestones as essential stages during the developmental course that have to be passed at a given age. Document [7] explains that developmental surveillance is the process of monitoring child development over time to promote healthy development and identify possible problems. Based on this information, we can conclude that if a 3-year-old child is unable to achieve a milestone that is expected at their age, it can be considered delayed development. Now, let's analyze the given options: A. Hopping on one leg: This is a gross motor skill that is typically expected to be achieved around 4-5 years of age, so it would not be considered delayed development in a 3-year-old child. B. Drawing square: This is a fine motor skill that is typically expected to be achieved around 4-5 years of age, so it would not be considered delayed development in a 3-year-old child. C. Feeding by spoon: This is a self-care skill that is typically expected to be achieved around 2-3 years of age, so it would not be considered delayed development in a 3-year-old child. D. Catching a ball reliably: This is a gross motor skill that is typically expected to be achieved around 4-5 years of age, so if a 3-year-old child is unable to catch a ball reliably, it can be considered delayed development. Therefore, the answer is D. Catching a ball reliably.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
