    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true, we need to evaluate each statement individually. \\n\\nA. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is responsible for causing hypercalcemia in cancer patients. This statement is true. PTHrP is produced by certain cancer cells and can mimic the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to increased calcium levels in the blood.\\n\\nB. The unionized fraction of calcium in the plasma is an important determinant of PTH secretion. This statement is true. The level of ionized calcium in the plasma is a major factor in regulating PTH secretion. When ionized calcium levels decrease, PTH secretion increases.\\n\\nC. Mg2+ influences PTH secretion in the same direction as Ca2+ but is a less potent secretagogue. This statement is true. Magnesium (Mg2+) can also influence PTH secretion, but its effect is less potent compared to calcium (Ca2+).\\n\\nD. Ca2+ influences PTH secretion by acting on a calcium sensor G-protein coupled receptor located in the parathyroid gland. This statement is not true. While calcium does play a role in regulating PTH secretion, it acts on calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) located on the surface of parathyroid cells, not a calcium sensor G-protein coupled receptor.\\n\\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is D. Ca2+ influences PTH secretion by acting on a calcium sensor G-protein coupled receptor located in the parathyroid gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
