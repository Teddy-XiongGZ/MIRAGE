    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The characteristic of orthodontic wire that describes energy storage capacity is resilience. Resilience represents the energy of a wire and refers to its ability to go through large deflections without being permanently deformed. Range refers to the range of deflection a wire can undergo before permanent deformation occurs. Formability refers to the amount of permanent bending a wire can go through before breaking. Proportional limit is a point at which the first permanent deformation is observed and does not directly relate to energy storage capacity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
