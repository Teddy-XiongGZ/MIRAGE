    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A material that speeds up a chemical reaction without chemically becoming involved is called a catalyst. A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, allowing the reaction to occur more quickly. It remains chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction and can be used again. Solvents, bases, and thermoplastics do not fit the description of a material that speeds up a reaction without becoming involved.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
