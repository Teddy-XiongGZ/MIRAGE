    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital cataract is a genetically heterogeneous condition, with mutations in multiple genes associated with its development. To determine the gene commonly indicated in congenital cataract, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that mutations in distinct genes, including crystallins (CRYA, CRYB, and CRYG), lens specific connexins (Cx43, Cx46, and Cx50), major intrinsic protein (MIP) or Aquaporin, cytoskeletal structural proteins, paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 (PITX3), avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF), and heat shock transcription factor 4 (HSF4), have been associated with congenital cataract. Document [1] also states that mutations in different genes may be associated with similar phenotypes. Document [8] mentions that 12 loci and 15 specific genes associated with inherited isolated cataract have been identified to date. Document [10] reports that mutations in known cataract genes, including CRYAA, CRYBB1, CRYBB3, CRYGC, CRYGD, GJA8, and MIP, have been implicated in cataractogenesis. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the gene commonly indicated in congenital cataract is CRYBB3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. CRYGS-3\"}"
