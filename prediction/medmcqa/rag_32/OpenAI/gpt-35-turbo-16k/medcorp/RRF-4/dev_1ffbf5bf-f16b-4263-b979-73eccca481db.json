    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the incidence of 2 canals in mandibular incisors, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [1] states that the incidence of two canals in incisors is 36.62%. Document [2] mentions that the overall prevalence of more than 1 root canal in mandibular central incisors is 40.5%. Document [3] reports that the prevalence of second canals in mandibular incisors ranges from 30% to 36.5%. Document [4] states that 8.9% of mandibular central incisors and 17.5% of mandibular lateral incisors have a second canal. Document [5] mentions that 6.7% of mandibular central incisors and 17.4% of mandibular lateral incisors have a double root canal. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the incidence of 2 canals in mandibular incisors is approximately 20 - 41%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 20 - 41%\"}"
