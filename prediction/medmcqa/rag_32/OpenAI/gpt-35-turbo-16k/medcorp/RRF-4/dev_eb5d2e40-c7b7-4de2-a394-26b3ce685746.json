    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Asymmetrical union of sutures resulting in a twisted skull is known as plagiocephaly. Plagiocephaly is a condition characterized by an abnormal asymmetrical head shape with unilateral flattening of the anterior and/or posterior part of the skull. It is caused by either synostotic (premature fusion of sutures) or deformational (external forces) factors. In this case, the question specifically mentions asymmetrical union of sutures, which is a characteristic of plagiocephaly. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Plagiocephaly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
