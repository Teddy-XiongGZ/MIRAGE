    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, Bennett movement refers to the lateral shift of the mandible during lateral jaw movements. It is characterized by a downward, forward, and inward movement of the condyle on the balancing side. The movement of the mandible in the lateral direction is primarily on the non-working side condyle, while the working side condyle undergoes an immediate, non-progressive lateral shift. The Bennett movement is influenced by factors such as muscle incoordination, TMJ dysfunction, and the choice of reference point. However, there is no mention of Bennett movement directly influencing the faciolingual or mesiodistal position of the teeth. Therefore, the answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
