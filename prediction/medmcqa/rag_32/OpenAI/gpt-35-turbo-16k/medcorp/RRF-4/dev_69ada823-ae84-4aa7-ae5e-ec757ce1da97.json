    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate treatment for mandibular angle fractures, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [7] states that traditional treatment protocols for angle fractures have involved rigid fixation with intraoperative maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) to ensure absolute stability. Document [15] mentions that currently, the use of a single monocortical plate with the Champy technique for osteosynthesis is preferred for noncomminuted fractures of the mandibular angle. Document [18] also supports the use of a single noncompression miniplate for the treatment of mandibular angle fractures. Based on this information, the most appropriate treatment for mandibular angle fractures would be A. 1 mini plate on oblique ridge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
