    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, MTA barrier in open apex teeth can be made up to 4mm or 5mm. Document [2] mentions the use of MTA apexification with a poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) fiber mesh as an apical barrier, and the mean duration for apical hard tissue barrier formation was 6.8 \u00b1 0.5 weeks, which suggests a barrier thickness of 4mm. Document [9] also mentions the use of MTA as an apical barrier with a thickness of 5mm. Therefore, the answer is B. 5mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
