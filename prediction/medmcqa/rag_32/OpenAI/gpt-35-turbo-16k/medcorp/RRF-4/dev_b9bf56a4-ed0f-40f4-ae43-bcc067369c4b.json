    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Permanent bending of an orthodontic wire during its clinical application can lead to work hardening of the alloy. Work hardening is a process in which the material becomes stronger and more resistant to deformation. This is achieved through the accumulation of dislocations in the crystal structure of the material. As a result of work hardening, the material's strength increases, its ductility decreases, and internal stresses are developed. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
