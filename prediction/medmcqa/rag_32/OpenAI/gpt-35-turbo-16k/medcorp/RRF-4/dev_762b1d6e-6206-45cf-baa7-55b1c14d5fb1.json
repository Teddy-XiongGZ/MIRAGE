    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks which marker is not used in the quadruple test for antenatal detection of Down syndrome. To answer this, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss the markers used in the quadruple test. Document [0] states that the quadruple test includes the measurement of four markers: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), unconjugated estriol (uE3), and inhibin A. Therefore, the marker that is not used in the quadruple test is Estradiol. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
