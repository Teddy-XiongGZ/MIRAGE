    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is effective for the management of persistent hypoglycemia in various conditions. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Large for date baby: Glucagon can be effective in managing hypoglycemia in large for date babies.\\nB. Galactosemia: Glucagon can be effective in managing hypoglycemia in galactosemia.\\nC. Infant of diabetic mother: Glucagon can be effective in managing hypoglycemia in infants of diabetic mothers.\\nD. Nesidioblastosis: Nesidioblastosis is a condition characterized by excessive insulin secretion, which can lead to hypoglycemia. In this case, glucagon may not be effective as it works by increasing hepatic glucose production from glycogenolysis, which may be impaired in nesidioblastosis.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the answer is D. Nesidioblastosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
