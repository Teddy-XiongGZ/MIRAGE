    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the worst prognosis during pregnancy in heart patients, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] states that maternal death occurred in 1% of pregnant women with heart disease, with the highest mortality found in patients with cardiomyopathy. Document [7] mentions that pregnancy is associated with a significant risk in women with severely impaired ventricular function, severe left heart obstruction, pulmonary hypertension, and aortopathy. Document [18] states that pregnancy in women with pre-existing heart disease is associated with increased maternal morbidity and perinatal morbidity. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the worst prognosis during pregnancy in heart patients is likely to be seen in those with severe ventricular dysfunction, severe left heart obstruction, pulmonary hypertension, and aortopathy. Therefore, the answer choice is C. Aortic stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
