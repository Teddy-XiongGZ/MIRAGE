    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metal oxides are added in porcelain for various purposes. To determine the purpose for which metal oxides are added, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. Document [0] mentions that metal oxides are used to mask the black color of metal and give it a shade of white. Document [2] states that the oxides in porcelain dental alloys enhance the tensile strength of the non-precious alloy after porcelain fusion. Document [6] mentions that the addition of silver and platinum nanoparticles (which are metal oxides) improves the mechanical properties of porcelain. Document [8] states that metal oxides are used to create a more natural and aesthetic appearance in porcelain restorations. Based on this information, we can conclude that metal oxides are added in porcelain for strength, improving bonding, and cosmetic purposes. However, there is no mention of metal oxides being added to impart color to porcelain. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Impart color.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
