    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity refers to the rigidity or stiffness of a material. It measures the material's resistance to being deformed elastically (i.e., non-permanently) when a stress is applied to it. It is not related to the ability to be stretched with permanent deformation (option B), the ductility of a material (option C), or the malleability of the metal (option D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
