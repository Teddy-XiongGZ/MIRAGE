    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the square knot is a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection. It is closely related to the granny knot, which is also a connected sum of two trefoils. The square knot can be constructed from two trefoil knots, one of which must be left-handed and the other right-handed. Each of the two knots is cut, and then the loose ends are joined together pairwise. The resulting connected sum is the square knot. It is important that the original trefoil knots be mirror images of one another. If two identical trefoil knots are used instead, the result is a granny knot. Based on this information, the square knot is composed of two single loops thrown in opposite directions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
