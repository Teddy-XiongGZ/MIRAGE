    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the rhythm generation of inspiration is primarily attributed to the Pre botzinger complex. Document [1] states that the preB\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC) is responsible for the generation of inspiration. Document [2] also supports this by mentioning that rhythmic inspirations continue even after completely transecting the brainstem at the caudal end of the facial nucleus, indicating that inspiration is generated by a separate rhythm generator located in the preB\u00f6tzinger Complex. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Pre botzinger complex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
