    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks for the most common pathognomonic sign of mandibular fracture. Pathognomonic signs are specific signs that are characteristic of a particular condition. To determine the answer, we need to review the information in the relevant documents. Document [7] mentions that pain, malocclusion, and tooth mobility provide signs of suspected alveolar bone fractures. Document [11] states that ecchymosis in the floor of the mouth is a pathognomonic sign of a mandibular body fracture. Document [26] mentions that loose teeth, numbness, and trismus are symptoms of mandibular fractures. None of the documents specifically mention sublingual hematoma or buccal hematoma as pathognomonic signs of mandibular fracture. Based on the information provided, the most common pathognomonic sign of mandibular fracture appears to be malocclusion, as mentioned in Document [11].\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Malocclusion\"}"
