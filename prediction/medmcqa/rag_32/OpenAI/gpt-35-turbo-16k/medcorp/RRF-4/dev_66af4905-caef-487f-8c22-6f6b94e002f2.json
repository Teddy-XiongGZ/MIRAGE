    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the relevant documents, the treatment for KOT is enucleation and peripheral osteotomy, with chemical cauterization. This is supported by Document [0], which states that the treatment for KOT was enucleation (n = 70) or marsupialization with subsequent enucleation (n = 22). Additionally, Document [23] compares the recurrence rates of KOT treated with Carnoy's solution (CS) versus modified Carnoy's solution (MC), and found that the recurrence rate was significantly lower in the CS group. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Enucleation and peripheral osteotomy, chemical cauterization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
