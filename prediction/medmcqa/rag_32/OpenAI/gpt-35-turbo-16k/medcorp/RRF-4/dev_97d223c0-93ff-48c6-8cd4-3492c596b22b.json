    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate pulmonary compliance, we need to use the formula C = \u0394V / \u0394P, where C is compliance, \u0394V is the change in volume, and \u0394P is the change in pleural pressure. In this case, the change in volume is the tidal volume of 500 mL, and the change in pleural pressure is the difference between the intrapleural pressure before and after inspiration, which is -4 cm H2O - (-9 cm H2O) = 5 cm H2O. Converting cm H2O to mL/cm H2O, we get 5 cm H2O * 1 mL/cm H2O = 5 mL/cm H2O. Therefore, the pulmonary compliance in this patient is 500 mL / 5 mL/cm H2O = 100 cm H2O/mL = 0.1 L/cm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
