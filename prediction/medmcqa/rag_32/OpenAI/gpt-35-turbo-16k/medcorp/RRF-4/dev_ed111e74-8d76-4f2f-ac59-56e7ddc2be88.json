    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common presentation of abdominal desmoid tumors, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that intra-abdominal desmoid tumors remain asymptomatic until their growth and infiltration causes visceral compression. Document [3] states that generally, desmoid tumors are painless and the recurrence rate is high if resection has not been complete. Document [11] mentions that desmoid tumors can present as abdominal masses. Document [17] describes that intra-abdominal desmoid tumors can grow large before causing symptoms such as obstructing bowel loops or urinary system. Based on this information, the most common presentation of abdominal desmoid tumors is likely to be an abdominal mass.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
