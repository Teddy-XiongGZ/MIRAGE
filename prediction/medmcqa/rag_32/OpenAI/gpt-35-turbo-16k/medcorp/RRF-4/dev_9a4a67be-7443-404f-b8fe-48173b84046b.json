    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the provided documents, there are different opinions regarding the removal of centric interference and working interference by reducing supporting cusps in natural dentition. Document [0] suggests that restoring cusps to achieve maximum structural efficiency lacks a rational basis, while document [7] mentions that working side interferences can be more destructive compared to centric interferences. Document [28] reviews different opinions on whether cusps should be retained or imitated when restoring an occlusion. Considering these conflicting views, it is difficult to definitively answer the question. However, it is possible to remove centric interference and working interference by reducing supporting cusps in natural dentition, but it is advisable to avoid it unless absolutely necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
