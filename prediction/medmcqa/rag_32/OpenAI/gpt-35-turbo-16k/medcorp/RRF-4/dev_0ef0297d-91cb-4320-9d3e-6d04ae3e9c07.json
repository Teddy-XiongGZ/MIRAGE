    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protein synthesis in eukaryotes involves several key components. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. RNA polymerase: RNA polymerase is responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA, but it is not directly involved in protein synthesis. Therefore, it is not required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes.\\n\\nB. Ribosomes: Ribosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. They are essential for translating mRNA into protein. Therefore, ribosomes are required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes.\\n\\nC. Peptidyl transferase: Peptidyl transferase is an enzyme found in the ribosome that catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds during protein synthesis. It is an integral part of the ribosome and is required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes.\\n\\nD. Amino acyl tRNA synthetase: Amino acyl tRNA synthetase is an enzyme responsible for attaching the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA molecule. It is required for the proper charging of tRNA molecules with amino acids, which is essential for protein synthesis. Therefore, amino acyl tRNA synthetase is required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. RNA polymerase, as it is not required for protein synthesis of eukaryotes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
