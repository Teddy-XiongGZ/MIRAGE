    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the short-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] describes a new non-depolarizing muscle relaxant called SZ1677, which has a relatively short duration of action and rapid onset. Document [2] mentions mivacurium as a short-acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Document [10] also mentions mivacurium as a short-acting nondepolarizing relaxant. Based on this information, the short-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is mivacurium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
