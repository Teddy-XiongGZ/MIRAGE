    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient with complete denture complains of pain while swallowing and there is overextension in the distolingual aspect. The muscle involved in swallowing is the palatopharyngeus muscle. This muscle is responsible for elevating the pharynx during swallowing and helps to close off the nasopharynx to prevent food or liquid from entering the nasal cavity. It is located in the posterior part of the oral cavity and connects the soft palate to the pharynx. Overextension in the distolingual aspect suggests that the palatopharyngeus muscle is being stretched or strained during swallowing, causing pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
