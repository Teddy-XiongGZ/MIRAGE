    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which option is not included in active tissue engineering, we need to understand what active tissue engineering involves. Active tissue engineering refers to the use of living cells and biomaterials to create functional tissue substitutes. The goal is to restore, maintain, or improve tissue function. Looking at the potential choices: \\n\\nA. Antigens fibroblasts: Antigens are substances that can stimulate an immune response. Fibroblasts are cells that produce the extracellular matrix and are involved in tissue repair. While fibroblasts can be used in tissue engineering, the use of antigens may not be directly related to active tissue engineering. \\n\\nB. Bilayered cell therapy: Bilayered cell therapy involves the use of two layers of cells to promote tissue regeneration. This is a technique used in active tissue engineering. \\n\\nC. Enamel matrix derivative: Enamel matrix derivative is a material derived from enamel that has been used in periodontal tissue engineering to promote the regeneration of periodontal tissues. This is also a technique used in active tissue engineering. \\n\\nD. Acellular dermal matrix: Acellular dermal matrix refers to a biomaterial derived from human or animal tissue that has been processed to remove cells. This matrix can be used as a scaffold in tissue engineering. This is also a technique used in active tissue engineering. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the option that is not included in active tissue engineering is A. Antigens fibroblasts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
