    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which classification uses the 'canine law' malocclusion in a sagittal direction, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [5] mentions that the British Standards Institute Classification classifies malocclusion into incisor relationship and canine relationship. It further explains that Class II in the incisor relationship occurs when the lower incisor edges lie posterior to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisors. This classification system aligns with the 'canine law' malocclusion in a sagittal direction. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Simon classification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
