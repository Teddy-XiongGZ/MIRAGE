    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, endodontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture due to various factors. Document [0] mentions that postendodontic tooth fractures might occur because of the loss of tooth structure and induced stresses caused by endodontic and restorative procedures. Document [2] states that endodontically treated posterior teeth present numerous problems because of coronal destruction from dental caries, fractures, and previous restorations or endodontic techniques, resulting in loss of tooth structure. Document [4] also mentions that endodontically treated teeth undergo loss of tooth substance due to dental caries, endodontic therapy, or previous restoration, which often leads to increased fracture susceptibility. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Loss of coronal structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
