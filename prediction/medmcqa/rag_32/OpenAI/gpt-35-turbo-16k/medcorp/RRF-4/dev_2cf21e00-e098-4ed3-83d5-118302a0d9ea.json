    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which center first gets the input from neural control of CVS, we need to analyze the relevant documents. Document [3] titled 'What the bird's brain tells the bird's eye: the function of descending input to the avian retina' discusses the centrifugal visual system (CVS) in birds, which delivers positive feedback to active ganglion cells in the retina. However, this document does not provide information about which center first receives the input from neural control of CVS. Document [6] titled 'A Practical Guide to Using CV Analysis for Determining the Locus of Synaptic Plasticity' discusses the coefficient of variation (CV) analysis for determining the locus of synaptic plasticity, but it does not provide information about the neural control of CVS. Document [12] titled 'Human-level comparable control volume mapping with a deep unsupervised-learning model for image-guided radiation therapy' discusses the control volume (CV) mapping for image-guided radiation therapy, but it does not provide information about the neural control of CVS. Therefore, none of the provided documents directly answer the question about which center first gets the input from neural control of CVS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
