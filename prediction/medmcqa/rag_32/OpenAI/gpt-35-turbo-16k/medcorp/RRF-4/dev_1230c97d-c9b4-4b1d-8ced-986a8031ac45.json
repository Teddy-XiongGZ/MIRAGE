    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is false about indirect ophthalmoscopy, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [4] states that an indirect ophthalmoscope provides a wider view of the inside of the eye and allows a better view of the fundus of the eye, even if the lens is clouded by cataracts. Document [11] mentions that a high minus setting of the ophthalmoscope and an extra positive lens in front of the patient's eye can increase magnification. Document [19] discusses the use of indirect ophthalmoscopy in vitreous floaters. Based on this information, we can conclude that statement C is false because the magnification of indirect ophthalmoscopy can be increased with additional lenses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
