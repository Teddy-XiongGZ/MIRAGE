    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, causing a conformational change in the enzyme that reduces its catalytic activity. This type of inhibition does not affect the binding of the substrate to the enzyme. Therefore, the effect of acetazolamide would be a decrease in Vmax, which represents the maximum rate of reaction that can be achieved by the enzyme. The Km, which represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax, is not affected by non-competitive inhibition. Therefore, the correct answer is D. No change in Vmax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
