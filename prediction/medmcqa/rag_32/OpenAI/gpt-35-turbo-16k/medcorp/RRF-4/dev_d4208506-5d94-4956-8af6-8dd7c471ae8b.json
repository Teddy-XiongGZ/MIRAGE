    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the management of a dengue patient with warning signs without shock and hemorrhage involves close monitoring and supportive care. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a stepwise approach to management, which includes early recognition, close monitoring for deterioration, and supportive care. IV fluids are initiated based on the patient's response, and the fluid rate is titrated accordingly. Platelet transfusion is considered when the platelet count drops to <20,000 cells/microliter and there is a high risk of bleeding. Steroids and antiviral medications are not recommended for the treatment of dengue. Therefore, the effective management for a dengue patient with warning signs without shock and hemorrhage is IV fluids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
