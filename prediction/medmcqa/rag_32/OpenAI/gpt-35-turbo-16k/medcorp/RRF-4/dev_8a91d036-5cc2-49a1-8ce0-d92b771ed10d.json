    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the different types of nerve fibers involved in dental pulp sensitivity and pain. Document [3] mentions that fast conducting A-delta fibers evoke a rapid, sharp, lancinating pain reaction, while C-fibers cause a slow, dull, crawling pain. Document [9] also states that A-fibers are responsible for the sensitivity of dentin and the sharp pain induced by dentinal stimulation, while C-fibers are activated only if the external stimuli reach the pulp proper and contribute to the dull pain associated with intense thermal stimulation and pulpal inflammation. Based on this information, the electric nerve tester would likely detect pain by stimulating A-delta fibers, and the sharp, shooting pain in reversible pulpitis would also indicate stimulation of A-delta fibers. Therefore, the answer choice is C. A delta.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
