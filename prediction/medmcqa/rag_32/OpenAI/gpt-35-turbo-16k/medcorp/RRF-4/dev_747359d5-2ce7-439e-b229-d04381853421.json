    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the likely acid-base imbalance, we need to analyze the given laboratory values. The pH of 7.3 indicates acidemia, which means the patient's blood pH is below the normal range. The pCO2 value of 35 mm Hg is within the normal range. Based on these values, the likely acid-base imbalance is metabolic acidosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metabolic acidosis\"}"
