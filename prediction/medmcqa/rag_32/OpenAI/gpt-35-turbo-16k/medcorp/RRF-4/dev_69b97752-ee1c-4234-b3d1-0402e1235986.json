    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options can be used to decrease IOP in glaucoma, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [9] mentions that intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only known modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. Document [15] states that the main goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower IOP. Document [29] mentions that reducing IOP is presently the most accepted and practiced therapeutic approach for glaucoma patients. Based on this information, we can conclude that all of the options (A. Mannitol, B. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, C. Apraclonidine, and D. Dexamethasone) can be used to decrease IOP in glaucoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
