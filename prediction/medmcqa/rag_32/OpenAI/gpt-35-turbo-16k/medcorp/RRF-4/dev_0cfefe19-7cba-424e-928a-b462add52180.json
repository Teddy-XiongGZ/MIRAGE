    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acid etching is a technique used in dentistry to prepare the tooth surface for bonding with restorative materials. It involves applying an acid, usually phosphoric acid, to the enamel surface to create a roughened surface that improves the adhesion of the restorative material. The most advantageous indication of acid etching is to decrease micro leakage. Micro leakage refers to the small gaps or spaces that can form between the tooth and the restorative material, allowing bacteria and fluids to penetrate and potentially cause decay or damage. Acid etching helps to create a strong bond between the tooth and the restorative material, reducing the risk of micro leakage and improving the longevity of the restoration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
