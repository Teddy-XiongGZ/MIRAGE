    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine that the specific site to which the enzyme CRE recombinase binds is the LoxP site. Document [1] states that the Cre recombinase catalyzes site-specific recombination of DNA between two loxP (locus of X-over P1) sites. Document [2] also mentions that the Cre protein is a site-specific DNA recombinase that can catalyze the recombination of DNA between specific sites in a DNA molecule, and these sites are known as loxP sequences. Therefore, the correct answer is B. LoxP site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
