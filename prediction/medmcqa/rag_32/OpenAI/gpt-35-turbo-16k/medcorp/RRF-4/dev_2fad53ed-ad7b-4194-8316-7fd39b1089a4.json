    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital CMV infection can result in a wide range of fetal abnormalities. To determine which abnormality is commonly seen in a fetus with congenital CMV infection, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [18] states that fetal abnormalities associated with CMV infection may include microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, and cerebral calcifications. Document [25] mentions that intracranial abnormalities such as ventriculomegaly, microcephaly, and calcifications can be seen in fetuses with CMV infection. Based on this information, the correct answer is likely to be either microcephaly or ventriculomegaly. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively determine which abnormality is more commonly seen. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be determined from the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
