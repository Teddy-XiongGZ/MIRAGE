    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If one parent is homozygous (i.e., has two copies of the recessive allele) and the other parent is heterozygous (i.e., has one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of the normal allele), the offspring have a 50% chance of inheriting the recessive allele from the heterozygous parent. If the offspring inherit the recessive allele from both parents, they will be affected by the disorder. Therefore, the outcome will be 50% of the children affected and the rest will be carriers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
