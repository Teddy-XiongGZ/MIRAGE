    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mandibulofacial dysostosis is a congenital disorder characterized by facial abnormalities. To determine the most characteristic feature of mandibulofacial dysostosis, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions that mandibulofacial dysostosis is characterized by hard and soft tissue abnormalities of the face, including malformations of the ear. Document [2] states that mandibulofacial dysostosis is characterized by bilateral involvement of facial structures, including malar and mandibular hypoplasia. Document [5] mentions that bilateral conductive deafness is common in mandibulofacial dysostosis. Document [7] states that mandibulofacial dysostosis can cause malformation of the auricles. Based on this information, the most characteristic feature of mandibulofacial dysostosis is likely to be malformations of the ear, specifically external and middle ear anomalies. Therefore, the answer choice is B. Normal vision with coloboma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
