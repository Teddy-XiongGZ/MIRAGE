    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best surgery to relieve intractable vertigo in a Meniere's disease patient, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [1] suggests that endolymphatic sac drainage and steroid instillation surgery (EDSS) could be recommended as an initial, less-invasive surgical treatment for intractable Meniere's disease. Document [6] also supports the effectiveness of endolymphatic sac-mastoid shunt surgery for intractable Meniere's disease. Document [15] mentions that endolymphatic sac-vein decompression surgery offers durable control of vertigo and stabilization of hearing for the majority of symptomatic patients. On the other hand, document [12] discusses the effectiveness of vestibular neurectomy in relieving vertigo while preserving hearing. Based on this information, the best surgery to relieve intractable vertigo in a Meniere's disease patient would be C. Endolymphatic sac decompression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
