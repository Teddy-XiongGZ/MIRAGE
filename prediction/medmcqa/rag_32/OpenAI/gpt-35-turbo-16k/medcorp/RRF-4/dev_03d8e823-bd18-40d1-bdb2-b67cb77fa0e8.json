    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the glomerulonephritis types has nephrotic syndrome, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [0] states that Minimal Change Disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Document [1] mentions that Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Document [4] states that Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a type of glomerulonephritis that can cause nephrotic syndrome. Document [5] mentions that a kidney biopsy is usually indicated for children with corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, which is often associated with Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Based on this information, the glomerulonephritis type that does not typically present with nephrotic syndrome is Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis. Therefore, the answer is B. Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
