    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which option is not a monomeric intermediate filament, we need to understand what monomeric intermediate filaments are. Monomeric intermediate filaments are individual subunits that can polymerize to form intermediate filaments. From the provided documents, we can see that vimentin, keratin, and desmin are all subunit proteins of intermediate filaments. However, tubulin is not a subunit protein of intermediate filaments. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Tubulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
