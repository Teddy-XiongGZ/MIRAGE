    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fractures occur when the applied load exceeds the fracture load (bone strength). The loading events that cause fractures include falls, heavy lifting, and high-energy trauma. Fractures can occur due to different types of forces, including tension, torsion, and compression. Based on the information provided, it is not specified which force has the maximum chances of causing a fracture. Therefore, the answer is D. Either of the three.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
