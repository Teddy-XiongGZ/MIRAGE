    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the earliest diagnosis of pregnancy that can be established safely. To determine this, we need to consider the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [2] states that the routine use of the serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test is a simple and reliable means of detecting pregnancy by ten days after nidation. Document [9] also mentions that ultrasonography is a widely used imaging tool in early pregnancy due to its accuracy and favorable safety profile for both the patient and fetus. However, it does not specify the specific timing for the earliest diagnosis. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the earliest diagnosis of pregnancy can be established safely by hCG levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
