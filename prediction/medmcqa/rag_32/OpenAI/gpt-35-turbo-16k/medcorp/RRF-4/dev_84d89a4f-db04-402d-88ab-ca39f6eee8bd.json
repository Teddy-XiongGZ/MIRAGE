    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information about the respiratory rhythm generation center. Document [0] mentions that the respiratory rate is set in the respiratory center by the dorsal respiratory group in the medulla. Document [1] states that the respiratory control center, which generates and modifies the basic ventilatory rhythm, is located in the medulla oblongata and consists of a ventilatory pattern generator and an integrator. Document [3] mentions the preB\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC) as the site necessary and sufficient for the generation of the inspiratory phase of the respiratory rhythm. Document [5] describes the central pattern generator (CPG) for respiration, which is located in the brainstem and produces rhythmic synaptic drive for motoneurons controlling respiratory muscles. Based on this information, the answer is B. Pre-Botzinger complex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
