    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is not a technique for protein precipitation, we need to review the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] mentions two widely used precipitation methods: ammonium sulfate precipitation and polyethyleneimine (PEI) precipitation. Document [2] also discusses ammonium sulfate precipitation as a useful technique in protein purification. Document [5] mentions isoelectric point precipitation, but it is primarily used to precipitate contaminant proteins rather than the target protein. Document [17] mentions non-ionic hydrophilic polymers as a method for protein precipitation. None of the documents mention trichloroacetic acid, heat precipitation, or titration with reducing sugar as techniques for protein precipitation. Therefore, the answer choice that is not a technique for protein precipitation is D. Titration with reducing sugar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
