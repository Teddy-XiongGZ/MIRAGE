    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When two screening tests are done in series, the goal is to increase the overall accuracy of the screening process. The first test is used to identify a larger group of individuals who may potentially have the condition being screened for. The second test is then used to further evaluate this group and confirm or rule out the presence of the condition. By combining the two tests, the sensitivity and specificity can be improved. Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals with the condition, while specificity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals without the condition. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased sensitivity and increased specificity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
