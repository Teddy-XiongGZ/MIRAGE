    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the 9-year-old boy has steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome with cushingoid features and small subcapsular cataracts. The most appropriate therapy of choice in this case would be Cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent that can be used in patients with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome who have not responded to other treatments. It is effective in reducing proteinuria and maintaining remission in these patients. Frusemide with enalapril is not the best choice as it only addresses the symptoms of fluid retention and hypertension, but does not target the underlying cause of the nephrotic syndrome. Intravenous immunoglobulin is not indicated for the treatment of steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. Intravenous pulse corticosteroids may be used as a short-term treatment option, but in this case, the patient has already been on long-term corticosteroid therapy and is steroid-dependent, so an alternative immunosuppressive agent like cyclophosphamide would be more appropriate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
