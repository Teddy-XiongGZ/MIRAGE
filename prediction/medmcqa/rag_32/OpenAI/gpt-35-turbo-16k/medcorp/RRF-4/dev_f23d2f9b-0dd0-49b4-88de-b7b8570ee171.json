    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Defective apoptosis and increased cell survival are associated with various diseases and conditions. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins and the loss of neurons, which can be attributed to defective apoptosis. Autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are also associated with defective apoptosis, leading to the accumulation of self-reactive immune cells. Myocardial infarction and stroke, on the other hand, are primarily caused by the blockage of blood flow to the heart or brain, respectively, and are not directly related to defective apoptosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Autoimmune disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
