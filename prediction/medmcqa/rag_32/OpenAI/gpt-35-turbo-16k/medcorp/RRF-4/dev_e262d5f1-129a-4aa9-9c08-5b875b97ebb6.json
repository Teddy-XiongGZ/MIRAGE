    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iodine is primarily important in the biochemical synthesis of thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroxine is synthesized by attaching iodine atoms to tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, a protein produced by the thyroid gland. The iodine atoms are added by the enzyme thyroperoxidase (TPO) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Thyroxine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
