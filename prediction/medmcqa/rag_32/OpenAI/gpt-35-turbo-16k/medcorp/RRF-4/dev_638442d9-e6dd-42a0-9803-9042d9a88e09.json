    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which bones are involved in wrist joint formation, we need to refer to the relevant documents that discuss the anatomy of the wrist. Document [29] states that the wrist joint is formed through the articulations between the distal radius and the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum. Document [7] also mentions that the parts forming the radiocarpal joint are the lower end of the radius and the under surface of the articular disk above, and the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetral bones below. Based on this information, we can conclude that the bones involved in wrist joint formation are the radius, scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum. The ulna is not mentioned in relation to the wrist joint formation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Ulna.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
