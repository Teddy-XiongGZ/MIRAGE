    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental plaque adheres to the tooth because of the production of sticky lipoproteins by microorganisms. Plaque is a biofilm that consists of bacteria embedded in a matrix of polymers of bacterial and salivary origin.

This adherence allows the plaque to form and accumulate on the tooth, leading to oral diseases such as tooth decay and periodontal problems.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
