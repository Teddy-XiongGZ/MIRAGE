    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which parasites are not found in hepatocytes, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. Document [0] mentions that Plasmodium sporozoites are highly hepatophilic, indicating that Plasmodium parasites are found in hepatocytes. Document [2] states that Plasmodium parasites infect hepatocytes, and the preference is for host cells with high ploidy. Document [3] mentions that Plasmodium parasites undergo their first obligate step inside hepatocytes. Document [5] discusses how Plasmodium yoelii rodent malaria parasites can induce apoptosis in infected hepatocytes. Document [7] mentions that sporozoites of malaria parasites are targeted to hepatocytes. Document [10] states that Plasmodium falciparum, a species of malaria parasite, has an initial tissue stage in liver cells. Document [15] describes the liver stage of Plasmodium berghei, another species of malaria parasite. Based on this information, it can be concluded that Plasmodium parasites, including P. falciparum and P. berghei, are found in hepatocytes. Therefore, the correct answer is not B. P. falciparium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
