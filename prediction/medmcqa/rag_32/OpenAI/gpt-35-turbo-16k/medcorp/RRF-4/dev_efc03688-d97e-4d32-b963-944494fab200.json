    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prolong the life of an all-ceramic crown placed on a mandibular canine, we need to consider factors that can reduce stress and minimize the risk of failure. Glazing and polishing are surface treatments that can improve the aesthetics and smoothness of the crown, but they do not directly affect the longevity of the crown. Out of occlusion (infraocclusion) refers to adjusting the crown so that it does not contact the opposing teeth during biting or chewing. This can help reduce the forces applied to the crown and minimize the risk of fracture. Group function is a occlusal scheme where the posterior teeth contact in a balanced and simultaneous manner during biting or chewing. This does not directly affect the longevity of the crown. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Out of occlusion (Infraocclusion).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
