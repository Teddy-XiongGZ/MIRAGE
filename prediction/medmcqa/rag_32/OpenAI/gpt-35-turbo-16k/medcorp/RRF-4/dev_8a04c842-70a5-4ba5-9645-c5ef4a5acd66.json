    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided in the documents, we can determine the answer by analyzing the descriptions of occlusal contacts in centric occlusion. Document [2] states that contacts in centric occlusion do not correspond to any ideal occlusal diagram. Document [12] mentions that an ideal occlusal contact was not found in any of the participants. Document [14] states that the number and distribution of occlusal contacts in centric occlusion have been studied, and all these studies define the greatest number of occlusal contacts between the molars. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that opposing contacts in centric occlusion may be expected at the buccal slopes of buccal cusps of maxillary posterior teeth. Hence, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
