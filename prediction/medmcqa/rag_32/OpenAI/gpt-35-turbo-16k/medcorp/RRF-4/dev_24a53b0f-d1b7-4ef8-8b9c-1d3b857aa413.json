    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the tooth with the smallest root, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [9] states that canines and most premolars, except for maxillary first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and mandibular molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Document [27] mentions that maxillary canines are single-rooted and are the longest of all tooth roots. Document [29] provides information about the number of roots in mandibular molars, stating that the numbers of roots excluding apical bifurcation of the mesial root are 2 and 3 in 99.0% and 1.0%, respectively, of the first molars. Based on this information, we can conclude that the tooth with the smallest root is the maxillary lateral incisor, as it is a single-rooted tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
