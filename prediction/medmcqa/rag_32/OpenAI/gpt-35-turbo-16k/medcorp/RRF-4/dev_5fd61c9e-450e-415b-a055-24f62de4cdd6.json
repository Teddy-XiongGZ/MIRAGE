    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which option should not be done in case of a wider osteotomy, we need to consider the potential risks and complications associated with each option. A wider osteotomy can increase the risk of instability and poor healing. A. Press buccal and lingual plate: This option involves using a plate on both the buccal and lingual sides of the bone to provide stability. While this may help with stability, it may not be sufficient to prevent complications in the case of a wider osteotomy. B. Wider implant: Using a wider implant may help provide stability and support in the case of a wider osteotomy. However, it may also increase the risk of implant failure and poor healing. C. Bone graft plus implant: This option involves using a bone graft in addition to an implant to provide stability and support. While a bone graft can help promote healing and stability, it may not be enough to prevent complications in the case of a wider osteotomy. D. Deep osteotomy: Performing a deep osteotomy involves removing a larger portion of the bone, which can increase the risk of instability and poor healing. Based on the potential risks and complications associated with each option, the option that should not be done in case of a wider osteotomy is D. Deep osteotomy. Performing a deep osteotomy can further increase the risk of instability and poor healing, and may not provide sufficient stability and support for the bone.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
