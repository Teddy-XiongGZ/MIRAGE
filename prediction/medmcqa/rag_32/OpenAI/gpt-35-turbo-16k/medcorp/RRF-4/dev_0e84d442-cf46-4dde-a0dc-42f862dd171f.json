    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The major mechanism of action of nitrates in the acute attack of angina is coronary vasodilation. Nitrates cause relaxation of the smooth muscle in the epicardial coronary arteries, leading to an increase in coronary blood flow and improved perfusion of the ischemic myocardium. This vasodilatory effect helps to relieve the symptoms of angina and reduce myocardial ischemia. While nitrates can also decrease preload and afterload, these effects are not the major mechanism of action in the acute attack of angina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
