    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks about the method used for selecting patients based on potential factors that will affect the results. To determine the appropriate method, we need to consider the characteristics of the potential factors and how they may influence the selection process. Systematic random sampling involves selecting every nth individual from a population, which may not be suitable for selecting patients based on specific factors. Simple random sampling involves randomly selecting individuals from a population, without considering any specific factors. Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and randomly selecting entire clusters, which may not be appropriate for selecting patients based on specific factors. Stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups based on specific factors and then randomly selecting individuals from each subgroup. This method allows for the selection of patients based on potential factors that will affect the results. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Stratified random sampling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
