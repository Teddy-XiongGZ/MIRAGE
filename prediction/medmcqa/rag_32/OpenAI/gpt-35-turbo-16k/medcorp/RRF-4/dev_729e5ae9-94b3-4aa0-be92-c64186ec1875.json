    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the purpose of incorporating a peripheral seal in an impression, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [0] describes the use of a removable acrylic resin tray handle to produce an improved peripheral sealing zone for functional impressions of complete dentures. Document [2] discusses the methods used to achieve a seal in the posterior palatal area. Document [3] compares the trueness of maxillary edentulous jaw impressions made with different impression techniques and materials. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the incorporation of a peripheral seal in an impression is necessary to obtain stability and a functionally moulded periphery. Harmonious occlusion and the posterior palatal seal are not directly related to the incorporation of a peripheral seal in an impression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Stability\"}"
