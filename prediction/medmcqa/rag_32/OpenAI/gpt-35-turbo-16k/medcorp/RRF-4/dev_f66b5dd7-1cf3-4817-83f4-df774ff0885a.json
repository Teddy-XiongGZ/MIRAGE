    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thumb-sucking can lead to malocclusion, including Class II malocclusion and anterior open bite. In this case, the patient has a severe thumb-sucking habit and presents with a Class II malocclusion, anterior open bite, and an overjet of 12mm. The cephalogram is a radiographic image that shows the skeletal relationships of the face. In patients with a severe thumb-sucking habit and Class II malocclusion, it is likely that the cephalogram will show increased posterior facial height and increased anterior facial height.
