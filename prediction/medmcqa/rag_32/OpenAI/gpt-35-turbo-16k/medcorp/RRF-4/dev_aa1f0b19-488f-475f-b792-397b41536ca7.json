    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which structure is not found in a living pulp, we need to analyze the information provided in the relevant documents. Document [25] states that the pulp mass contains various cell types, including fibroblasts, odontoblasts, histiocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and plasma cells. It also mentions that the extracellular matrix of the pulp is composed of collagenous fibers and ground substance. Therefore, we can conclude that collagen fibers are found in a living pulp. Document [6] states that no nerve fibers (myelinated or non-myelinated) were found in the dental pulp tissue of elephants. This suggests that non-myelinated nerve fibers are not found in a living pulp. Haversian fibers are not mentioned in any of the documents, so we cannot determine if they are found in a living pulp. Reticulum is not mentioned in any of the documents as well. Based on this information, the answer choice that is not found in a living pulp is C. Non-myelinated nerve fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
