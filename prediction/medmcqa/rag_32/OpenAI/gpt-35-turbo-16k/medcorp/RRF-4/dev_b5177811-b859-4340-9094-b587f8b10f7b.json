    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the percentage of cases of mandibular incisors with a single apical foramen, we need to review the relevant documents. Document [5] states that greater than 85% of the root canals in mandibular incisors possess a single canal (Type I). However, Document [12] mentions that the percentage of mandibular incisors with two canals is 25.8%. Therefore, the percentage of cases with a single apical foramen can be calculated by subtracting the percentage of cases with two canals from 100%. This gives us 100% - 25.8% = 74.2%. Therefore, the answer is D. 60%-78%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 60%- 78%\"}"
