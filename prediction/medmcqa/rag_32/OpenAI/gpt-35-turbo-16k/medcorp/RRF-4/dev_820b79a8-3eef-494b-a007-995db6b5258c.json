    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the documents, the nerve fibers have different sensitivities to local anesthetic (LA) blockade. Type B fibers are the most sensitive, followed by type C fibers, type A delta fibers, type A gamma fibers, type A beta fibers, and type A alpha fibers. Therefore, the least susceptible to LA blockade would be A alpha fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
