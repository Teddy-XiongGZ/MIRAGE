    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the relaxed state, the chest wall and lung recoil are balanced at the functional residual capacity (FRC). FRC is the volume remaining in the lungs after a normal, passive exhalation. It represents the point in the breathing cycle where the lung tissue elastic recoil and chest wall outward expansion are equal and balanced. Therefore, the answer is D. FRC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
