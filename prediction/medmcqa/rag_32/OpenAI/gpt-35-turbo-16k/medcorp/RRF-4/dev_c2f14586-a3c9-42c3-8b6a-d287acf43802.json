    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the relevant documents, the force required to tip a tooth depends on various factors such as the location of the force, the center of rotation, and the type of tooth movement. Document [0] mentions that a light force can readily tip a tooth, while translation requires more force. Document [1] states that increasing the countertipping couple from zero causes the center of rotation to move from a point near the apical end of the middle third of the root to the root apex and then to infinity. Document [7] mentions that tipping tooth movement requires a smaller force compared to bodily movement. Based on this information, it is difficult to determine the exact force range required to tip a tooth. However, considering the options provided, the most appropriate choice would be A. 10 - 20mg, as it represents a relatively light force that can tip a tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
