    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the signs of brain death, we need to refer to the relevant documents. Document [2] discusses the observation of spinally-mediated movements in brain-dead patients, indicating that abnormal gross and fine movements may be present. Document [21] mentions that absence of brainstem reflexes is a crucial determinant for the diagnosis of brain death. Document [26] reports two pediatric cases in which patients demonstrated clinical signs of brain stem function that are not recognized or tested in current guidelines. Based on this information, we can conclude that positive spinal reflexes on stimulation would not be a sign of brain death. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
