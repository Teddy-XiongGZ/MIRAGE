    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 76-year-old female with a non-healing ulcer on the labia majora for 6 months, measuring 2 x 3 cm, and no palpable lymphadenopathy. The biopsy shows squamous cell carcinoma. The management of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease. In this case, the extent of the disease is not mentioned, so we need to consider the treatment options based on the available information. Radical vulvectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy is typically reserved for more advanced stages of the disease with lymph node involvement. Chemoradiation with resection may be considered for locally advanced disease. Simple vulvectomy involves removing the entire vulva, which may be excessive for a small tumor. Wide excision, which involves removing the tumor with a margin of healthy tissue, is a reasonable option for a small tumor without lymph node involvement. Based on the information provided, the most appropriate management option for this patient would be B. Wide excision.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
