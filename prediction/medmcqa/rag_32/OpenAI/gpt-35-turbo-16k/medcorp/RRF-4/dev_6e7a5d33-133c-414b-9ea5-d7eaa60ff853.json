    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a fractured central incisor with a fracture line extending 4 mm gingival below CEJ. The bone is thin buccally and thick apicopalatally. The treatment of choice in this case would be to consider extraction and implant. Socket shield technique involves retaining a portion of the root during extraction, which may not be suitable in this case as the fracture line extends below the CEJ. Post and core may not be appropriate if the tooth is extensively fractured. Socket preservation may be considered if extraction is chosen, but the question specifically asks for the treatment of choice, which is extraction and implant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Extraction and implant\"}"
