    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, there are several physiological changes that occur in the body. Let's analyze each option to determine which one is correct:\\n\\nA. Cerebral blood flow increases if there is an increase in systolic blood pressure: This statement is not necessarily true. While exercise can cause an increase in systolic blood pressure, it does not always result in an increase in cerebral blood flow. In fact, during exercise, blood flow is redirected away from non-essential organs, including the brain, to the working muscles.\\n\\nB. Body temperature increases: This statement is generally true. During exercise, the body generates heat, which leads to an increase in body temperature.\\n\\nC. Blood flow to muscle increases after 1\u00bd minute: This statement is generally true. During exercise, blood flow to the working muscles increases to deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products. This increase in blood flow typically occurs within the first few minutes of exercise.\\n\\nD. Lymphatic flow from muscle decreases: This statement is not supported by the provided information. The documents do not mention anything about lymphatic flow during exercise. Therefore, we cannot conclude that lymphatic flow from the muscle decreases during exercise.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C. Blood flow to muscle increases after 1\u00bd minute.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
