    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the description of the lesion as a 1x1.5cm pedunculated lesion on the soft palate with a rough, 'warty' surface but the same colour as adjacent mucosa, the most appropriate management would be to perform an excisional biopsy. This is because the lesion is well-circumscribed and can be completely removed through excision, allowing for histopathological examination to determine the diagnosis. An incisional biopsy, which involves taking a sample of the lesion, may not provide enough tissue for an accurate diagnosis. Scrape for exfoliative cytology may not be sufficient to determine the nature of the lesion. Observing the lesion for two weeks without intervention may delay diagnosis and appropriate treatment if the lesion is malignant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Perform excisional biopsy\"}"
