    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents provide information on the process of clot lysis. Document [0] states that lysis of retracted clots proceeds through stages of activation of bound plasminogen, partial degradation of fibrin, opening of new plasminogen-binding sites on degraded fibrin, and binding of plasminogen to these new sites. Document [2] confirms that clot retraction facilitates clot lysis. Document [6] shows that lysis of clots can be induced by the release of cellular plasminogen activator. Document [8] suggests that clot lysis is influenced by the diameter of the fibrin fibers. Finally, document [25] indicates that incorporation of fragment X into fibrin clots renders them more susceptible to lysis by plasmin. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Plasmin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
