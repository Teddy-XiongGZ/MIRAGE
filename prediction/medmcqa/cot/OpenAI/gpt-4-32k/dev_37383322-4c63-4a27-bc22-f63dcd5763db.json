    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, is composed of several layers. The topmost layer is the stratum corneum, which is composed of dead skin cells, or corneocytes. Below this is the stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and the deepest layer, the stratum basale. Merkel cells are located in the stratum basale, the deepest layer of the epidermis. Melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, are also found in the stratum basale. Langerhans cells are found in the stratum spinosum, which is above the stratum basale but below the stratum corneum. Therefore, the correct order from surface to deep layer is corneocytes, Langerhans cells, melanocytes, and then Merkel cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
