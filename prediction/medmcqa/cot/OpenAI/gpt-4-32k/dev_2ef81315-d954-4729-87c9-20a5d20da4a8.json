    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Massive blood transfusion can lead to several complications. One of them is metabolic acidosis. This happens because the stored blood used in transfusions contains citrate, which is metabolized in the liver into bicarbonate. In massive transfusions, the liver may not be able to metabolize all the citrate, leading to citrate toxicity. This can cause a decrease in calcium levels (since citrate binds to calcium), leading to hypocalcemia. Additionally, the bicarbonate that is produced can lead to a metabolic alkalosis. However, in a situation of massive transfusion, the body may not be able to compensate for this, leading to a metabolic acidosis instead.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metabolic acidosis\"}"
