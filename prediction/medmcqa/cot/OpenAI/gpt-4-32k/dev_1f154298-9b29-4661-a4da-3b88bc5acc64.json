    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"\u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids typically results in the production of Acetyl CoA. However, when odd-chain fatty acids undergo \u03b2-oxidation, the final three carbon fragment is cleaved off as Propionyl CoA, not Acetyl CoA which is a two carbon fragment. Therefore, the product of \u03b2-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids is Propionyl CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
