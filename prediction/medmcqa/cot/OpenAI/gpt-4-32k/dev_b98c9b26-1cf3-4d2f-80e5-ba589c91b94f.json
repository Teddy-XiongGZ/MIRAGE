    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in evaluating a neonate with seizures is to determine the cause. The most common causes of neonatal seizures are hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, and infections. An imaging study is necessary to identify structural abnormalities or hemorrhage. Transcranial ultrasound is a non-invasive, bedside procedure that can be used to detect gross intracranial abnormalities and hemorrhages, but it is not as sensitive or specific as a CT or MRI. A CT scan can provide more detailed information about the brain structure and can detect hemorrhages, but it exposes the child to radiation. An MRI provides the most detailed information about the brain structure and does not expose the child to radiation. Therefore, an MRI would be the best next step in the investigation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. MRI brain\"}"
