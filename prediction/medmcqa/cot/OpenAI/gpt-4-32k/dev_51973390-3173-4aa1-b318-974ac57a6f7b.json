    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Posterior interproximal caries are cavities that occur between the teeth, towards the back of the mouth. To diagnose these, a bite-wing radiograph is typically used because it provides a clear view of the interproximal areas. The bisecting angle technique is not ideal for children because it can lead to image distortion. The paralleling technique is also not ideal because it requires the patient to hold the film or sensor in place with their mouth, which can be difficult for children. RVG, or RadioVisioGraphy, is a type of digital imaging sensor which can be used with the bite-wing technique to provide a clear, detailed image. Panoramic radiography is not typically used for diagnosing interproximal caries because it does not provide a detailed view of the individual teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bite wing with RVG\"}"
