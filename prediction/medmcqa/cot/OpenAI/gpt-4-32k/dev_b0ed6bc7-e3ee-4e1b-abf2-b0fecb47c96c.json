    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Agglutination in a blood sample occurs when antibodies (antiserum) bind to antigens on the surface of red blood cells, causing them to clump together. Antiserum A and B are used to detect the presence of A and B antigens respectively. If no agglutination is seen when both antiserum A and B are added, it means that the blood sample does not have A or B antigens, which indicates that the blood group is O. The Rh factor is a separate antigen. If the blood sample is Rh positive, it means it has the Rh antigen. Since the question states that the Rh factor is positive, the blood group is O and Rh positive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. O group and Rh+ve\"}"
