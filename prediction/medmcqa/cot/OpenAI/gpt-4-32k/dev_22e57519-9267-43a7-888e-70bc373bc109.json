    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrophobia is a classic symptom of rabies. The diagnosis of rabies can be done by several methods. Negri bodies are intracytoplasmic inclusions found in the neurons of individuals with rabies, but they are not always present. Antibodies to rabies virus can be detected, but this requires a serological test and may not be positive in the early stages of the disease. PCR for rabies virus is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect the virus in various samples, including corneal scrapings. Indirect immunofluorescence is also a method used to detect rabies virus antigen in samples, but it is less sensitive than PCR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
