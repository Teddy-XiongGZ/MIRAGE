    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coefficient of friction is a measure of the amount of friction existing between two surfaces. Different alloys have different coefficients of friction. Stainless steel (SS) has a relatively low coefficient of friction. TMA (Titanium Molybdenum Alloy) also has a relatively low coefficient of friction. Ni-Ti (Nickel Titanium) has a higher coefficient of friction than both SS and TMA. Elgiloy is a cobalt-based alloy and has a relatively high coefficient of friction, but it's not as high as Ni-Ti.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Ni-Ti\"}"
