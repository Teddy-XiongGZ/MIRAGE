    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetyl CoA is a molecule that participates in many biochemical reactions in protein, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Its main function is to deliver the acetyl group to the citric acid cycle to be oxidized for energy production. HMG-CoA synthase, Malonyl CoA synthetase, and Fatty acid synthetase are all enzymes that use Acetyl CoA as a substrate. However, Malic enzyme does not use Acetyl CoA as a substrate. Instead, it catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Malic enzyme\"}"
