    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Class V cavity is located in the gingival third of the facial or lingual surfaces of the tooth. The mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity are not dependent on the direction of enamel rods, as this is more related to the preparation of the cavity rather than its location. The presence of a carious lesion would determine the need for a cavity, but not specifically the mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity. The contour of the gingiva could influence the extent of the cavity, but it does not determine the mesial and distal walls. The location of the contact area, however, does influence the mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity, as these walls are defined by the proximal surfaces of the tooth that are adjacent to the neighboring teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
