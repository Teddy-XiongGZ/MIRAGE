    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RNAi, or RNA interference, is a biological process where RNA molecules inhibit gene expression. It does this by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules, which leads to a decrease in the activity of the gene. This process does not completely eliminate the gene's function, which would be a knock out, nor does it increase the gene's function, which would be a knock up. It also does not introduce a new gene, which would be a knock in. Therefore, the process of RNAi is most accurately described as a knock down.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
