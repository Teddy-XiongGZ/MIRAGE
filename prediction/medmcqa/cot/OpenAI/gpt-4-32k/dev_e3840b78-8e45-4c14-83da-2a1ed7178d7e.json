    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Etching porcelain is a process used in dentistry to increase the surface area of a porcelain crown or veneer to improve the bond strength between the porcelain and the cement. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used for this purpose. The concentration of HF used for etching porcelain is typically 4-9.6%. 1.23% HF is too weak to effectively etch porcelain, and 37% HF is too strong and can be dangerous to use. Therefore, the correct answer should be either 4% HF or 9.6% HF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 4% HF\"}"
