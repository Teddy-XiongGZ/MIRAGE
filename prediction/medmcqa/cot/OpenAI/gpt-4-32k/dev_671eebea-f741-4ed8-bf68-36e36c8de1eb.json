    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noise-induced hearing loss is caused by damage to the hair cells that are found in our inner ear. These hair cells convert the sounds we hear into electrical signals that travel to the brain. Once damaged, our hair cells cannot grow back, which results in permanent hearing loss. Among the inner and outer hair cells, the outer hair cells are more susceptible to noise damage because they are responsible for amplifying sounds, making them more vulnerable to loud noises.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Outer hair cell\"}"
