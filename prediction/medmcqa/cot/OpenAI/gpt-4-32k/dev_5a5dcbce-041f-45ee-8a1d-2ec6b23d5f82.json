    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome, which means his condition relapses whenever the dose of steroids is reduced or stopped. The patient is also showing signs of steroid toxicity, such as Cushingoid features and cataracts. Therefore, continuing with steroids is not a good option. Frusemide and enalapril are used to manage symptoms of nephrotic syndrome like edema and hypertension, but they do not treat the underlying cause. Intravenous immunoglobulin is used in minimal change disease, but it's not the first line of treatment. Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressant that is used as a second-line treatment in steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. It helps to induce remission and allows for the reduction of steroid dosage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cyclophosphamide\"}"
