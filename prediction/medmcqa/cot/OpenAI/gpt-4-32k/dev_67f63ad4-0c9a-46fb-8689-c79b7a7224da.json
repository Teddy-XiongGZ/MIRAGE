    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old female with normal secondary sexual characteristics (pubic hair and breast development), but she has primary amenorrhea, which means she has never had a menstrual period. This suggests a problem with the reproductive system. Turner syndrome can be ruled out because it is associated with an abnormal karyotype, but the patient's karyotype is normal. Testicular feminization, also known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, can also be ruled out because it is a condition in which a person is genetically male but has the physical traits of a female, and this doesn't match the patient's presentation. Kallmann syndrome is a condition characterized by delayed or absent puberty and an impaired sense of smell, but the patient has normal pubic hair and breast development, indicating normal puberty. Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is a condition in which the uterus and part of the vagina do not develop properly, which could explain the primary amenorrhea. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Mullerian agenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
