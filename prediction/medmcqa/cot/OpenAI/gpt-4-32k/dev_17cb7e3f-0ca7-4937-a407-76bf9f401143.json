    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand the situation. The patient has a complicated crown fracture with abscess formation in tooth 12. The X-ray shows radiolucency in relation to teeth 11 and 12. Tooth 12 has an immature blunderbuss canal, while tooth 11 has complete root formation. However, the vitality of teeth 11 and 21 is negative, indicating that these teeth are non-vital or dead. Now, let's consider the treatment options. Apexification of 12 would be a good option if the tooth was vital, but it's not. Revascularization in 12 is a good option because it's a procedure used to treat immature teeth with necrotic pulp, which is the case here. Root canal treatment (RCT) of 11 is also a good option because the tooth is non-vital. Therefore, the best management for this patient would be revascularization in 12 and RCT of 11.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
