    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the liver and kidneys. Proteinuria, or excess protein in the urine, is one of the key diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia. Severe preeclampsia is typically diagnosed when proteinuria exceeds 5 grams in a 24-hour urine collection, or a spot urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 3.5. Given that 1 gram equals 1000 milligrams, 5 grams would be equivalent to 5000 milligrams. However, none of the options provided reach this level. The highest option provided is 3000 mg, which is still a significant amount of proteinuria and could indicate severe preeclampsia in some cases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
