Methyl methacrylate is a type of plastic, but it's more commonly used in bone cement and dental prosthetics, not for ear or ocular prostheses. Metallic implants are used in various medical procedures, but they are not suitable for ear and ocular prostheses due to their weight and potential for causing discomfort.
