    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrates are a type of medication used to treat and prevent angina. They work by relaxing and widening blood vessels. This allows more blood to flow to the heart muscle and reduces its workload. The major mechanism of action of nitrates in an acute attack of angina is not primarily through coronary vasodilation, although this can occur. The primary mechanism is through a decrease in preload, which reduces the amount of work the heart has to do and the amount of oxygen it needs, thereby relieving the symptoms of angina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decrease in preload\"}"
