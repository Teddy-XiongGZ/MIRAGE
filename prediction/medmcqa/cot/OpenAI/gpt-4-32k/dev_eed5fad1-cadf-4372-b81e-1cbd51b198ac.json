    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a transparent thermoplastic often used as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. It is also known as acrylic or acrylic glass. The Knoop Hardness Number (KHN) of PMMA is indeed around 18-20, so option A is correct. PMMA is also chemically stable up to a certain temperature, but it starts to decompose at around 200 degrees Celsius, which is approximately 392 degrees Fahrenheit, so option B is also correct. The modulus of elasticity of PMMA is around 2.4 GPa, so option C is correct. However, the tensile strength of PMMA is around 70-130 MPa, which is much higher than 29 MPa, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
