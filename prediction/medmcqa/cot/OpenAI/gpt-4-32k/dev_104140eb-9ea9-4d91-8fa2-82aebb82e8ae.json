    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A grid is used in radiography to improve the quality of the images by reducing the scatter radiation, which can fog the image. However, using a grid requires a higher dose of radiation to be used, which increases patient exposure. Therefore, the disadvantage of using a grid is not decreased exposure time or reducing secondary radiation to film. It also does not increase secondary radiation fog to film, as the purpose of the grid is to reduce this. So, the disadvantage is increased patient exposure due to more exposure time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
