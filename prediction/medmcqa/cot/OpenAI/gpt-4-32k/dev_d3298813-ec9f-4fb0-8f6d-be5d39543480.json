    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular first molar in a child is innervated by the inferior alveolar nerve and the long buccal nerve. The inferior alveolar nerve provides sensation to the lower teeth on the right or left half of the dental arch, as well as sense of touch to the lower lip and chin. The long buccal nerve provides sensation to the area of the cheek in contact with the gums of the lower molars and premolars. Therefore, to prepare a cavity on a mandibular first molar, we would need to block both the inferior alveolar nerve and the long buccal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Inferior alveolar nerve block and long buccal nerve block\"}"
