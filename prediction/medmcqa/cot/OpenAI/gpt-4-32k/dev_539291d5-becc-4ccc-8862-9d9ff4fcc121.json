    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clotting of blood is a complex process that involves several steps. Plasmin is an enzyme that breaks down blood clots, so it can't be the answer. Thrombin is a protein involved in the clotting process, but it primarily converts fibrinogen to fibrin, it doesn't cross-link the clot. HMWK (High Molecular Weight Kininogen) is involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, but it doesn't cross-link the clot. Factor XIII, on the other hand, is known to stabilize the clot by cross-linking fibrin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
