    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malignant pustule is a term that is not commonly used in modern medicine, but historically, it has been used to refer to a specific type of skin lesion. Facio-cervical actinomycosis is a bacterial infection that can cause abscesses and other skin lesions, but it is not typically referred to as a malignant pustule. Infected squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can become infected and form a pustule, but again, this is not typically referred to as a malignant pustule. Cutaneous anthrax, however, is a bacterial infection that can cause a characteristic skin lesion known as a malignant pustule. Therefore, the correct answer is Cutaneous anthrax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
