    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Papillary necrosis is a condition that affects the kidneys. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including urinary tract infections, diabetes, sickle cell disease, and tuberculosis. Therefore, a bacterial culture of urine (D) would be useful to identify any bacterial infections, a urine-PCR for TB (C) would be useful to identify tuberculosis, and a sickling test (B) would be useful to identify sickle cell disease. However, a urine acidification test (A) is not typically used to investigate the cause of papillary necrosis, as it is more commonly used to diagnose renal tubular acidosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
