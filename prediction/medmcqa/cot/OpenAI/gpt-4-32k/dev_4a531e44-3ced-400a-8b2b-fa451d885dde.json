    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha fibers, also known as A \u03b1 fibers, are a type of sensory nerve fiber. They are myelinated and have a large diameter, which allows them to conduct electrical signals quickly. The speed of electrical conductivity in A \u03b1 fibers is typically measured in meters per second (m/s). The given options do not specify the units, but assuming they are in m/s, the speed of A \u03b1 fibers is known to be among the fastest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
