    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a chronic lung condition, possibly bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A chest X-ray can show some signs of these conditions, but it is not the most specific test. An MRI is not typically used for lung imaging due to the lungs' high air content. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage can provide valuable information, but it is an invasive procedure and not the first choice for diagnosis. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the most specific non-invasive test for diagnosing lung diseases, as it can provide detailed images of the lung's structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
