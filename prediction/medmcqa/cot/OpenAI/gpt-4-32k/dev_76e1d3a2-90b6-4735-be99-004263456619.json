    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resistance form in endodontics refers to the shape and design of the prepared cavity that prevents displacement or movement of the restorative material, such as gutta-percha, by functional forces. Therefore, it is related to the ability of the prepared tooth to resist the forces that could cause displacement of the gutta-percha. This means that the resistance form resists the movement of gutta-percha in the apical area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
