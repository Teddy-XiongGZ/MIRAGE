This deformity is typically seen in children following a fracture of the distal radius. The distal radius is the end of the larger of the two bones in the forearm, near the wrist. When this area is injured, it can result in a fish tail deformity where the end of the bone takes on a shape that resembles a fish's tail.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Distal Radius\"}"
