    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gravida (G) refers to the number of times a woman has been pregnant, regardless of the outcome. Para (P) refers to the number of pregnancies that reach viable gestational age (including live births and stillbirths). The numbers after P are used to provide more information about the woman's obstetric history. The first number refers to full-term births, the second number refers to preterm births, and the third number refers to pregnancies ending in spontaneous or therapeutic abortions. In this case, the woman has been pregnant 4 times (twin pregnancy counts as one), has had one full-term birth, no preterm births, and two abortions. Therefore, her obstetric history is best represented as G4P1 1+0+2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. G4P1 0+1+2\"}"
