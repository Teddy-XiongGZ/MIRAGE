    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aphasia is a condition that affects the ability to express and understand language. The patient's symptoms include difficulty in naming things and poor repetition, but comprehension, fluency, and understanding written words are unaffected. This rules out Broca's aphasia, which is characterized by non-fluent speech and difficulty in comprehension. Anomic aphasia primarily affects the ability to name objects, but repetition is usually not affected, so this is also not the correct answer. Transcortical sensory aphasia is characterized by poor comprehension but good repetition, which does not match the patient's symptoms. Conduction aphasia, on the other hand, is characterized by good comprehension and fluency but difficulty in repetition and naming objects, which matches the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Conduction aphasia\"}"
