    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a blood vessel is injured, the process of hemostasis begins, which is the body's way of stopping bleeding. The first step in this process is vasoconstriction, which reduces blood flow to the area. The second step is the formation of a platelet plug, which is where the question is focused. Platelets adhere to the exposed collagen fibers at the site of injury, and this adhesion is facilitated by a protein called von Willebrand factor. Factor 8 and 9 are involved in the coagulation cascade, which is a later step in hemostasis. Fibronectin is a glycoprotein that helps in cell adhesion and growth, but it is not directly involved in platelet adhesion to collagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
