    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy. In one of the steps of this cycle, a high-energy phosphate compound is formed through substrate-level phosphorylation. This process involves the direct transfer of a phosphate group to ADP from a phosphorylated reactive intermediate to form ATP. However, in some organisms, including humans, the equivalent molecule that is actually formed is GTP (guanosine triphosphate), which can be readily converted to ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. GTP\"}"
