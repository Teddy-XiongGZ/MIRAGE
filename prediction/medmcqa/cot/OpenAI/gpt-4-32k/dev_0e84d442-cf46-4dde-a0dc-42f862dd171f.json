    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrates are a type of medication used to treat and prevent chest pain (angina). They work by relaxing and widening blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow to the heart muscle. This can help prevent angina attacks.

This means they cause the coronary arteries to widen, increasing blood flow to the heart muscle and relieving the pain of an angina attack.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Coronary vasodilation\"}"
