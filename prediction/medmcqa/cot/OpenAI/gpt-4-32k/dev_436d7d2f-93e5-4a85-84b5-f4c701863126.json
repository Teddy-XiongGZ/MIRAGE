    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Levator Ani is a broad, thin muscle located on the side of the pelvis. It is made up of three parts: the iliococcygeus, the pubococcygeus, and the puborectalis. So, option C is correct. The muscle fibers of these three parts converge downwards and medially, which is stated in option A. The Levator Ani supports the pelvic viscera, as stated in option B. However, the Levator Ani is not attached to the pelvic brim, but rather to the inside of the pelvis, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
