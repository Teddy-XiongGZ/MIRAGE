    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has lost a significant amount of blood and needs both PRBCs and platelets. However, only one IV line is accessible, so we can only transfuse one product at a time. PRBCs should be started first because they are more critical in replacing lost blood volume and carrying oxygen. Platelets are important for clotting, but they can be stored at room temperature for a short period of time without significant loss of function. Therefore, the PRBCs should be started first, and the platelets should be stored at room temperature until they can be transfused.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
