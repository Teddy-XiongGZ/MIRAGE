    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mental foramen is a small opening in the anterior surface of the mandible which allows the passage of the mental nerve and vessels. A fracture passing through this area with less than 10 mm of bone remaining is a complex situation. MMF (Maxillomandibular fixation) is usually used for stable fractures and wouldn't provide enough support in this case. Reconstruction plates and 3-D plates are typically used for larger fractures. Lag screws, on the other hand, are used for smaller, more precise areas and can provide the necessary support and stability for a fracture of this size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Lag screws\"}"
