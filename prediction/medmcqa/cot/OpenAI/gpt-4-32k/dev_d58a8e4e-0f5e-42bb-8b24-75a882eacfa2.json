    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"IOL stands for Intraocular Lens, which is a lens implanted in the eye as part of a treatment for cataracts or myopia. Once an IOL is placed, it is typically intended to remain in the eye for a lifetime. It is not routinely removed or replaced after a certain period of time, such as 10 years. However, complications can occur, such as posterior capsule opacification (PCO), which is a gradual thickening, yellowing, and clouding of the posterior capsule. If PCO occurs, a procedure called a YAG laser capsulotomy may be performed to restore clear vision, but the IOL itself is not typically removed. Presbyopia is a condition associated with aging, and it's not a reason to remove an IOL. Therefore, the IOL should not be removed unless there are specific complications or issues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Never be removed\"}"
