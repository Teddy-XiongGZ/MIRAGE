    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A keyhole-shaped visual field defect, also known as a tunnel vision, is typically associated with peripheral vision loss. This type of vision loss is not associated with the optic disk, as this would typically result in a central scotoma. Lesions in the optic chiasma usually result in bitemporal hemianopia, which is a loss of the outer (temporal) half of the visual field in both eyes. Lesions in the lateral geniculate body can cause a variety of visual field defects, but not typically a keyhole-shaped defect. Lesions in the occipital lobe, specifically in the peripheral visual field representation areas, can cause tunnel vision or a keyhole-shaped visual field defect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Occipital lobe\"}"
