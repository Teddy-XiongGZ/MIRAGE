    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Obturation with gutta-percha cones is a common procedure in endodontic treatment. It is used to fill and seal the canals after cleaning and shaping. However, in primary teeth, this procedure is not typically used because primary teeth will eventually be replaced by permanent teeth. The only situation where it might be indicated is when the successor, or the permanent tooth that is supposed to replace the primary tooth, is missing. In this case, the primary tooth might need to be preserved for a longer period, and therefore, a more permanent filling material like gutta-percha might be used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
