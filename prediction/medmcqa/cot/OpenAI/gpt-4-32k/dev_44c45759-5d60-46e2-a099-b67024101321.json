    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The darkening of a radiograph X-ray is influenced by several factors. The thickness of the object (A) affects the amount of X-rays that can pass through, thus affecting the darkening. The quality and quantity of X-rays (B) directly influence the darkening as well. The velocity of electrons emitted from the cathode (D) affects the energy of the X-rays produced, which in turn affects the darkening. However, the angulation cone (C) is related to the direction of the X-ray beam and does not directly influence the darkening of the radiograph.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
