    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a complex structure that allows for movement of the jaw. The articular disc of the TMJ is a fibrocartilaginous structure that separates the two bones that form the joint. The position and movement of this disc is controlled by the muscles and ligaments that surround the joint. The lateral pterygoid muscle, specifically the upper head, is primarily responsible for controlling the movement and position of the articular disc. The lower head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, the sphenomandibular ligament, and the superficial head of the medial pterygoid muscle do not have a significant role in controlling the position and movement of the articular disc.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Upper head of lateral pterygoid muscle\"}"
