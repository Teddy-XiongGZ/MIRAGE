    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A lactating mother should be cautious about drug usage as many drugs can pass into breast milk and affect the baby. Option A is incorrect because it's not true that most drugs are secreted negligibly in the milk. Some drugs can indeed be secreted in significant amounts. Option B is also incorrect because drugs with longer half-lives tend to stay in the body longer, which could potentially increase the amount of drug passed to the baby through breast milk. Option D is not practical or necessary as it would mean the mother could never take any medication, even if needed for her health. Option C is the best advice because it minimizes the amount of drug in the breast milk at the time of feeding. The drug concentration in the milk is usually highest soon after the drug is taken and decreases over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
