    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"H-type tracheoesophageal fistula is a rare type of esophageal atresia where there is a direct connection between the trachea and esophagus. While a chest X-ray or CT scan may show indirect signs of this condition, they are not definitive diagnostic tools. Tracheo-bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy are both endoscopic procedures that allow direct visualization of the abnormal connection, which is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. However, esophagoscopy is more specific to the esophagus and would be more likely to detect the fistula.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Esophagoscopy\"}"
