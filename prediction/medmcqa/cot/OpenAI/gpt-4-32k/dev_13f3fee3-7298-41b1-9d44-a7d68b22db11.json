    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Submandibular calculus refers to the formation of stones in the submandibular gland, which is a salivary gland. The best way to remove these stones is by accessing the duct that drains the gland. Dilatation of the duct (option A) might not be sufficient to remove the calculus. Excision of the opening of the duct (option B) would not remove the calculus and could potentially cause more problems. Removal of the gland (option C) is a more invasive procedure and is usually reserved for severe cases. Incision of the duct and removal of the calculus (option D) is the most direct and effective way to remove the calculus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
