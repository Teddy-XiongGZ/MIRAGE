    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mother-to-child transmission of HIV is the spread of HIV from an HIV-infected woman to her child during pregnancy, childbirth (also called labor and delivery), or breastfeeding (through breast milk). Without treatment, if a pregnant woman is living with HIV the likelihood of the virus passing from mother-to-child is 15-45%. However, the question specifies the transmission during delivery in a non-breastfed child. This narrows down the transmission rate to around 15-30%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 15-30%\"}"
