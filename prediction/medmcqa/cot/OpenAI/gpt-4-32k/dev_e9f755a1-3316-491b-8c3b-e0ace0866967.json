    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's complaint of sensitivity to chewing pressure after the insertion of a distal extension partial denture could be due to several reasons. However, the most probable reason would be improper occlusion. This is because improper occlusion can cause an uneven distribution of forces during mastication, leading to sensitivity. Abrasion of tooth by clasp would cause more of a constant discomfort rather than sensitivity to chewing pressure. Wearing off the cement base would also cause discomfort, but it's less likely to happen just 3 weeks after insertion. A passive retentive arm would not cause sensitivity to chewing pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
