    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"COPD, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Let's go through the options one by one. A. Decreased FEV1: This is true. FEV1, or Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second, is often reduced in COPD because of the difficulty in expelling air from the lungs. B. Decreased MEFR: This is also true. MEFR, or Maximum Expiratory Flow Rate, is often decreased in COPD due to the obstruction of the airways. C. Increased RV: This is true. RV, or Residual Volume, is often increased in COPD because the air gets trapped in the lungs and cannot be fully exhaled. D. Decreased diffusion capacity: This is not typically seen in COPD. Diffusion capacity refers to the ability of the lungs to transfer gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the blood. While this can be affected in other lung diseases, it is not a characteristic feature of COPD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
