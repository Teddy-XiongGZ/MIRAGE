    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Local anesthetics are primarily metabolized in the liver. Therefore, in cases of liver failure, it's important to choose an anesthetic that is not heavily dependent on the liver for its metabolism. Articaine is primarily metabolized in the blood by plasma esterases, and only a small portion is metabolized in the liver. Lignocaine, Bupivacaine, and Benzocaine, on the other hand, are primarily metabolized in the liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Articaine\"}"
