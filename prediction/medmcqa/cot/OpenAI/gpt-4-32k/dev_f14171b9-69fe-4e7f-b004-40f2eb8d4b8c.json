    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The G2 phase is a part of the cell cycle, and certain drugs can block this phase. Etoposide and Topotecan are topoisomerase inhibitors, which block the cell cycle in the late S to G2 phase. Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic, which also blocks the cell cycle in the G2 phase. Paclitaxel, on the other hand, is a mitotic inhibitor that blocks the cell cycle in the M phase, not the G2 phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Paclitaxel\"}"
