This suggests a condition that was not present at birth but developed later. VSD large (A) and AP window defect (D) are congenital heart defects that would likely have been detected at birth. Ebstein anomaly (C) is a rare congenital heart defect that affects the tricuspid valve, but it also would likely have been detected at birth. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (B), on the other hand, is a condition that can initially go unnoticed but then lead to severe symptoms as the ductus arteriosus, a blood vessel that's open during fetal development but closes soon after birth, starts to close. This would match the timeline of the child's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
