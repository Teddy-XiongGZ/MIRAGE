    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cyst under the tongue caused by obstruction of a salivary gland is not a mucocele, as mucoceles are typically found in the lower lip and are caused by a ruptured salivary gland duct. It's also not a dermoid cyst, as these are typically found in the ovaries or testes. A dentigerous cyst is associated with the crown of an unerupted or developing tooth, so it's not the correct answer either. A ranula is a type of mucocele found on the floor of the mouth, often under the tongue, and is caused by the obstruction of a salivary gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ranula\"}"
