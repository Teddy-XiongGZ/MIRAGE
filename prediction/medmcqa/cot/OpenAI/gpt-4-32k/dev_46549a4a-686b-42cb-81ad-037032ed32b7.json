    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High copper alloys are known for their high tensile strength, which means they can withstand a lot of tension without breaking. They also have low creep, which means they don't deform under mechanical stresses. However, high copper alloys are not known for high corrosion. They are actually quite resistant to corrosion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
