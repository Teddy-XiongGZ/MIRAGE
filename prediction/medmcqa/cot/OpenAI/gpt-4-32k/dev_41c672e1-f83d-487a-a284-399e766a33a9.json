    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inter-radicular area refers to the space between the roots of the teeth. This area is filled with bone that supports the teeth and helps to anchor them in place. There are two main types of bone in the body: cortical and cancellous. Cortical bone is the hard outer layer of bone that provides strength and structure. Cancellous bone, on the other hand, is softer and more porous, and is found in the interior of bones. In the inter-radicular area, the bone is cancellous because it needs to be able to absorb the forces exerted on the teeth during chewing and other activities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cancellous\"}"
