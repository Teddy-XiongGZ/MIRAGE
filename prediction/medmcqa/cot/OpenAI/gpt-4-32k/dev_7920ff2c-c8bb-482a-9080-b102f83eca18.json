    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An avulsed tooth is a tooth that has been knocked out. The goal is to preserve the tooth in a medium that can keep the cells on the root surface alive until it can be replanted. The buccal vestibule is not a medium, it's a part of the mouth. Water is not a good medium because it can cause the cells to burst due to osmosis. Cotton is also not a good medium because it can cause the tooth to dry out. Milk, on the other hand, has a neutral pH and contains proteins, sugars, and growth factors, which can help to preserve the tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Milk\"}"
