    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Angiofibroma is a benign growth that occurs in the nasopharynx. The staging of angiofibroma is based on its extent of spread. Stage I is when the tumor is confined to the nasopharynx. Stage II is when the tumor extends to the nasal cavity and/or one or more paranasal sinuses. Stage III is when the tumor extends beyond the nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses to other areas such as the pterygopalatine fossa, infratemporal fossa, or orbit. Stage IV is when the tumor extends to the intracranial region. Therefore, if the angiofibroma extends to one or more paranasal sinuses, it is classified as Stage II.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Stage II\"}"
