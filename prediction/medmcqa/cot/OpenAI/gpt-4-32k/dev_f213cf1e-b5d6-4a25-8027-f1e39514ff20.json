    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 75-year-old chronic smoker with diabetes and has been edentulous for the last 30 years. This means that the patient has no teeth, which can affect the strength and structure of the jawbone. The patient has a bilateral body fracture, which means that both sides of a bone, likely the mandible in this case, are broken. Considering the patient's age, chronic smoking, and diabetes, these factors may affect the patient's healing process. Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) with a reconstruction plate (option A) is a common treatment for mandibular fractures, but it may not be the best option for this patient due to the potential for complications from surgery and the patient's overall health status. Gunning splints (option B) are a non-surgical treatment option that can be used to stabilize fractures and are often used in patients who are not good candidates for surgery. Two mini plates (option C) and wire osteosynthesis (option D) are also surgical options, but again, considering the patient's overall health status, a non-surgical option may be more appropriate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
