    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pCO2 level in arterial blood gas (ABG) is a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. An elevated pCO2 level indicates that the body is not able to eliminate carbon dioxide effectively, which is usually due to a problem with the respiratory system. Both the respiratory apparatus (lungs, airways) and the respiratory centre (part of the brain that controls breathing) are involved in this process. Damage to either could potentially cause an increase in pCO2 levels. However, a massive lung contusion alone would not necessarily result in raised pCO2 levels, as the respiratory centre could potentially compensate for this injury by increasing the rate and depth of breathing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Damage to both respiratory apparatus and respiratory centre\"}"
