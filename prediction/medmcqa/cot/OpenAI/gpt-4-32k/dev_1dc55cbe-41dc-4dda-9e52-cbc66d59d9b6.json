    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antischkow cells, also known as caterpillar cells, are a type of cell that can be found in certain conditions, particularly rheumatic fever. They are not typically associated with sickle cell anaemia, iron deficiency anaemia, apthous ulcer, or herpes simplex. However, among these options, sickle cell anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia are blood-related conditions, so there might be a higher chance of finding Antischkow cells in these conditions compared to apthous ulcer and herpes simplex, which are more related to skin and mucous membranes. Therefore, the condition least likely to have Antischkow cells would be one of the latter two.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. herpes simplex\"}"
