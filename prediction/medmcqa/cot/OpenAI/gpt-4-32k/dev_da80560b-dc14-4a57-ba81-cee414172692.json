    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has a fracture at the apical third of the root, but the tooth is still vital and only slightly mobile. This means that the tooth is still alive and there is a chance for it to heal. Extraction would be too drastic at this point.

Relieving the occlusion and splinting the tooth would stabilize it and allow for healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
