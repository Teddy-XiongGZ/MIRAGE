    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A deep carious lesion refers to a severe dental cavity that has penetrated deep into the tooth. Incomplete debridement, or removal of the decayed tissue, is sometimes performed to avoid exposing the pulp, which is the innermost part of the tooth containing nerves and blood vessels. This is done to prevent potential complications such as pain, infection, and the need for a root canal. The remaining thin layer of dentin, which is the hard tissue beneath the tooth's enamel, can then continue to protect the pulp. Secondary dentin formation, sealing the cavity, and avoiding microleakage are not the primary reasons for incomplete debridement in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
