    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cross-sectional study provides a snapshot of the population at a certain point in time, but it does not provide information on the temporal relationship between smoking and lung cancer. A randomized controlled trial is not ethical in this case because we cannot expose people to smoking to see if they develop lung cancer. A cohort study would be ideal to establish a temporal relationship and causality, but it is not the quickest method. A case-control study, on the other hand, is retrospective and quicker to conduct because it starts with people who already have lung cancer (cases) and those who do not (controls), and then looks back in time to see their smoking status.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
