    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The access cavity shape for a mandibular first molar with four canals is typically determined by the anatomy of the tooth. The mandibular first molar usually has two roots, one mesial and one distal, with two canals in each root. Therefore, the access cavity should be shaped to allow access to all four canals. A trapezoidal shape is often recommended because it allows for adequate access to all canals while preserving as much tooth structure as possible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Trapezoidal\"}"
