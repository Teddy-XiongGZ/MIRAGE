    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Seminoma is a type of testicular cancer. Tumor markers are substances that can be found in higher than normal amounts in the blood, urine, or body tissues of some patients with certain types of cancer. PLAP, LDH, AFP, and HCG are all tumor markers. However, PLAP and LDH are the most commonly elevated in seminoma. AFP is typically elevated in non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, not seminomas. HCG can be elevated in both seminomas and non-seminomas, but it is not as specific as PLAP or LDH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. PLAP\"}"
