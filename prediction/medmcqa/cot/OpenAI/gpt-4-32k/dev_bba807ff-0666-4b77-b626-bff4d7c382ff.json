    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a force is applied perpendicular to a surface, it either compresses or stretches the material. This is not a shear stress, which occurs when forces are applied parallel to the surface. Tensile stress and strain occur when a material is stretched, while compressive stress and strain occur when a material is compressed. Therefore, the type of strain that develops can either be compressive or tensile, depending on whether the material is being compressed or stretched.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Compressive strain, B. Tensile strain\"}"
