    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation induced thyroid cancer is a result of exposure to radiation, which affects the cells of the thyroid gland. This is not a genetic effect, as it does not involve changes to the genetic material that are passed on to offspring. It is also not a teratogenic effect, as teratogens cause birth defects, and this is not relevant to thyroid cancer. It is not autosomal, as this term refers to chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes. Therefore, the effect is somatic, as it involves changes to the body cells (in this case, the thyroid cells) that are not passed on to offspring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
