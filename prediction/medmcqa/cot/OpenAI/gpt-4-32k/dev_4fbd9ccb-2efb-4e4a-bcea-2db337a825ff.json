    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"NSAIDs can cause gastric irritation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which protect the stomach lining. Therefore, a drug that can counteract this effect would need to either replace or mimic the action of prostaglandins. Roxatidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist used for treating peptic ulcers and gastritis, but it does not directly counteract the effects of NSAIDs. Pirenzepine is an anticholinergic drug used to treat peptic ulcers, but it also does not directly counteract the effects of NSAIDs. Betaxolol is a beta blocker used for treating high blood pressure and glaucoma, so it's not related to gastric irritation. Misoprostol, on the other hand, is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue that can replace the protective prostaglandins inhibited by NSAIDs, thus preventing gastric ulcers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Misoprostol\"}"
