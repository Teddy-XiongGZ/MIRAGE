    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a neonate with bilateral jerking of both upper limbs and occasional twitching of the neck. This suggests that the seizures are affecting multiple areas of the body, not just one focal area. Therefore, the seizures are not focal (either clonic or tonic), they are multifocal. The term 'clonic' refers to rapid contraction and relaxation of muscles, which is consistent with the jerking described. 'Tonic' refers to a state of sustained muscle contraction, which is not described in the question. Therefore, the seizures are likely multifocal clonic, not multifocal tonic clonic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Multifocal clonic\"}"
