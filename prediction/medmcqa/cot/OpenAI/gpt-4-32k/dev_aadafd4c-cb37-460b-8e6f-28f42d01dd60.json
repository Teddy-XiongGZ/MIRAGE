    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pilocarpine is a medication that works by constricting the pupil. If it fails to produce pupillary constriction, it could be due to a few reasons. Adie's tonic pupil is a condition where the pupil is large and doesn't react to light, but it should still react to pilocarpine. Diabetic III nerve palsy could cause a dilated pupil, but it should also react to pilocarpine. Uncal herniation could cause a dilated pupil, but it's a severe condition that would likely have other symptoms. Pharmacological blockade, on the other hand, would prevent the action of pilocarpine, making it the most probable reason.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pharmacological blockade\"}"
