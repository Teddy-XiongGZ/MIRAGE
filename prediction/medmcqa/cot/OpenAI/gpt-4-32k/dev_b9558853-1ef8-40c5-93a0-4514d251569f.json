    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Difficult mask ventilation is usually indicated by factors that obstruct the airway or make it difficult to create a seal with the mask. A patient having a history of snoring could indicate sleep apnea or other airway obstructions, which could make mask ventilation difficult. A patient having a beard could make it difficult to create a seal with the mask, leading to difficult mask ventilation. Old age could be associated with a number of factors that make mask ventilation difficult, such as decreased lung capacity or increased likelihood of airway obstructions. However, a full set of teeth present does not necessarily indicate difficult mask ventilation. While missing teeth can sometimes make mask ventilation more difficult because of the potential for air leaks, having a full set of teeth does not make mask ventilation more difficult.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
