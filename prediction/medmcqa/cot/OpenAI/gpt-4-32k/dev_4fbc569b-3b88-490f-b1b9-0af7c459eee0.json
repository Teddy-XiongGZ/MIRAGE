    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tumor suppressor genes are genes that regulate cell division and prevent the formation of tumors. pRb, FHIT, and PTCH are all known tumor suppressor genes. pRb is involved in controlling cell cycle progression, FHIT is frequently deleted in cancer, and PTCH is implicated in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for cell growth and differentiation. On the other hand, c-erbB1, also known as EGFR, is not a tumor suppressor gene. Instead, it is a proto-oncogene, which can promote cell growth and proliferation when mutated or overexpressed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
