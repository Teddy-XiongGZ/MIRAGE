    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Berkesonian bias is a type of selection bias, but it specifically refers to bias introduced when the selection of subjects into the study is related to both the exposure and the disease. Confound bias is when an extraneous variable correlates with both the dependent variable and the independent variable. Memory or recall bias is when the way that the data is collected relies on people's memory, and people may not remember accurately. Selection bias, in general, refers to the bias introduced by the selection of individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. In this case, the bias arises from evaluating data on patients and hospital records only, which increases the probability of exposure to a particular factor. This is a classic example of selection bias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Selection bias\"}"
