    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sensitivity of a vaccine to heat is determined by a Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM). This is a label containing a heat-sensitive material which is placed on a vaccine vial to register cumulative heat exposure over time. The color of the VVM changes progressively as it is exposed to heat. This allows health workers to identify vaccines that have been damaged by heat. The other options do not correspond to any known parameters used in vaccine storage or monitoring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
