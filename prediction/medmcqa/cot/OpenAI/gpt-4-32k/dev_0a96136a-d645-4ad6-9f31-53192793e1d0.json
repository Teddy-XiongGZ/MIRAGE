It's a common problem in people with kidney disease and affects almost everyone with renal failure. In renal osteodystrophy, the kidneys are unable to excrete phosphate leading to hyperphosphatemia. Nutritional and genetic forms of osteomalacia are usually associated with hypophosphatemia due to decreased intestinal absorption or increased renal losses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
