    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The occlusal isthmus of a dental amalgam refers to the narrowest part of the filling that is in contact with the opposing tooth. The resistance to fracture of this part of the filling is influenced by several factors. The pulpal floor depth (option A) is not directly related to the resistance to fracture. The presence of a dove tail (option B) can increase the retention of the filling but does not necessarily increase its resistance to fracture. Unsupported enamel at the gingival cavosurface margin (option D) is not directly related to the resistance to fracture of the occlusal isthmus. However, the axiopulpal line angle (option C) is the internal angle formed by the junction of the axial and pulpal walls of a cavity. If this angle is rounded, it can distribute the forces applied to the filling more evenly, thereby increasing the resistance to fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
