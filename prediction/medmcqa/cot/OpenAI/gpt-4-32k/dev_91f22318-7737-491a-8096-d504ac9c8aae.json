    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mean and standard deviation are statistical measures that require numerical data. Nominal scale is a naming scale, where variables are simply 'named' or 'labeled', with no specific order. Ordinal scale has 'order' or 'rank' that makes it more precise than nominal scales, but the intervals between the ranks may not be equal. Dichotomous scale is a type of nominal scale which offers two choices of answers. Interval/Ratio scale is a numerical scale where the order and the exact differences between the values are known. Therefore, mean and standard deviation can only be calculated if the data is on an interval/ratio scale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
