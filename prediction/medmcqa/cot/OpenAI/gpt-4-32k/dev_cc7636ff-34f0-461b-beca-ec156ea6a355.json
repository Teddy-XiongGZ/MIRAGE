Hypophosphatasia is a metabolic disorder that affects the development of bones and teeth, but it doesn't typically cause hypercementosis. Achondroplasia is a form of short-limbed dwarfism and doesn't directly affect the teeth. Fibrous dysplasia is a bone disorder where fibrous tissue replaces normal bone, leading to deformities and fractures, but it doesn't typically cause hypercementosis. Paget's disease, on the other hand, is a chronic bone disorder that can cause abnormal bone remodeling, including in the jaw, which can lead to hypercementosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
