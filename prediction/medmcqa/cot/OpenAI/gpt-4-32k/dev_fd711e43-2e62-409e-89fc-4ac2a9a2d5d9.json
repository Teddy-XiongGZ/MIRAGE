    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infertility in males can be due to a number of factors. Volume refers to the amount of semen a man produces and is not necessarily indicative of fertility. Concentration refers to the number of sperm cells in a given amount of semen, but this alone does not determine fertility. Motility refers to the ability of the sperm to move properly towards an egg, which is crucial for fertilization. Sperm count refers to the total number of sperm in the semen, which is also important. However, even if a man has a high sperm count, if the sperm are not motile, they may not be able to reach the egg for fertilization. Therefore, motility is a very important marker of male infertility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
