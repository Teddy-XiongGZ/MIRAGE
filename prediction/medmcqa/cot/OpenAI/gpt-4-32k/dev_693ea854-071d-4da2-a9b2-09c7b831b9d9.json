    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To exclude a disease, we need a test that will correctly identify those who do not have the disease. This is known as a true negative result. Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), while specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). Positive predictivity is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. Negative predictivity is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly do not have the disease. Therefore, to exclude a disease, we need a test with high negative predictivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Negative predictivity\"}"
