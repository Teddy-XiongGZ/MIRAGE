    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Brachycephaly, a condition where the head is shorter in relation to its width, and a narrow foramen magnum, the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes, are not typical features of Down syndrome or Fanconi syndrome. Cleidocranial dysplasia is characterized by collarbone (clavicle) abnormalities and delayed closing of the spaces between the bones of the skull (fontanels), but not necessarily brachycephaly or a narrow foramen magnum.
