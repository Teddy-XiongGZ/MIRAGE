    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Active tissue engineering involves the use of living cells to repair or replace damaged tissue. This can include the use of fibroblasts (A), which are a type of cell that synthesizes the extracellular matrix and collagen, the structural framework for animal tissues, and play a critical role in wound healing. Bilayered cell therapy (B) is also a part of active tissue engineering as it involves the use of two layers of cells to promote healing. Enamel matrix derivative (C) is used in periodontal tissue regeneration, which is a part of tissue engineering. However, acellular dermal matrix (D) is not part of active tissue engineering because it does not involve the use of living cells. Instead, it is a type of biomaterial derived from human or animal tissues where the cells have been removed, leaving behind the extracellular matrix that can serve as a scaffold for new cell growth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
