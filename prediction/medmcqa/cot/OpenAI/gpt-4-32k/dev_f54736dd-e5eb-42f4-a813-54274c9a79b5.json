    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Open reduction and fixation of a fracture of the mandibular condyle is typically indicated when there is significant displacement or deformity that cannot be managed with closed reduction. A green stick fracture in children (option C) is usually managed conservatively. A condylar fracture which is not dislocated (option D) would not typically require open reduction and fixation. Superior 5 mm condyle is fractured (option B) is not a clear indication for open reduction. However, shortening of ramal height by more than 5 mm (option A) can lead to significant functional impairment and is a clear indication for open reduction and fixation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
