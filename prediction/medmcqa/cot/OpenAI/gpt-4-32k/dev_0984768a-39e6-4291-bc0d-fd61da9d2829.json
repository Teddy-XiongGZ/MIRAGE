    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The World Health Organization (WHO) uses the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) to classify diseases and health conditions. The code 4.81 in the context of periapical pathology refers to a specific type of condition. Periapical refers to the area around the apex of a tooth root. A periapical cyst, also known as a radicular cyst, is the most common type of cyst affecting the jaws and is usually associated with a non-vital tooth. A lateral cyst is a type of cyst that develops on the side of a tooth root, while a residual cyst is a cyst that remains after the extraction of a tooth. An inflammatory periodontal cyst, on the other hand, is a type of cyst that develops in the periodontal tissues, usually as a result of inflammation. According to the ICD-10, the code K04.81 is used for periapical abscess without sinus, not for any type of cyst.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
