    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intrafusal fibers are part of the muscle spindle and are responsible for detecting changes in muscle length. They are divided into two types: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. Nuclear bag fibers are fewer in number, which makes option A true. Nuclear chain fibers are indeed shorter and thinner, making option B also true. Primary endings can be excited by both bag and chain fibers, not just bag fibers, making option D false. Secondary endings can be excited by both bag and chain fibers, not just chain fibers, making option C also false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
