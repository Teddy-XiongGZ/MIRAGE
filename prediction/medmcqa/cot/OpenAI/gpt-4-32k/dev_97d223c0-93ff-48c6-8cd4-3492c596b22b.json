    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulmonary compliance is a measure of the lung's ability to stretch and expand. It is calculated as the change in lung volume (\u0394V) divided by the change in pleural pressure (\u0394P). In this case, the change in lung volume is the tidal volume, which is 500 mL or 0.5 L. The change in pleural pressure is the difference between the pressures before and after inspiration, which is -9 cm H2O - (-4 cm H2O) = -5 cm H2O. However, because pressure is a negative value in this context, we take the absolute value, which is 5 cm H2O. Therefore, the pulmonary compliance is 0.5 L / 5 cm H2O = 0.1 L/cm H2O.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
