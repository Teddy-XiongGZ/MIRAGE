    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a young, lactating mother with a painful breast lump. Mammography is not the first choice in young women because their breast tissue is denser, making it harder to detect abnormalities. MRI is a more detailed imaging technique but it's not typically the first line of investigation due to its cost and availability. X-ray is not specific for breast tissue. Ultrasound (USG) is the most appropriate initial investigation in this case because it can differentiate between solid and cystic masses, and it's safe for both the mother and the baby.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
