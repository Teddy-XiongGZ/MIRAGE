    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening in the neck leading directly to the trachea (windpipe). The purpose of a tracheostomy is to bypass an obstructed upper airway, to clean and remove secretions from the airway, or to more easily, and usually more safely, deliver oxygen to the lungs. Therefore, it would not increase dead air space (A) or respiratory resistance (B), nor would it cause obstruction in respiration (D). Instead, by bypassing the upper airway, it would decrease the work of breathing, thus decreasing respiratory work (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
