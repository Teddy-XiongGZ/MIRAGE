    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Erythroblastosis fetalis, also known as hemolytic disease of the newborn, is a condition that occurs when there is incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and the fetus. This is most commonly due to Rh incompatibility, where the mother is Rh negative and the fetus is Rh positive. The mother's immune system can produce antibodies against the Rh D antigen on the fetal red blood cells, leading to hemolysis. Anti D is therefore involved in erythroblastosis fetalis. Anti C and Anti E are also Rh antigens and can cause erythroblastosis fetalis. However, Anti Lewis is not involved in erythroblastosis fetalis. Lewis antibodies are naturally occurring and do not cause hemolytic disease of the newborn.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Anti Lewis\"}"
