    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vitamin A deficiency is known to cause changes in the conjunctiva. One of the most common changes is the hyperplasia of goblet cells. Goblet cells are responsible for producing mucus, which helps to protect the eye. When there is a deficiency in vitamin A, the body tries to compensate by producing more goblet cells. This leads to hyperplasia of these cells. The other options like actinic degeneration, hyperkeratosis of squamous epithelium, and stromal infiltration are not typically associated with vitamin A deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
