    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Local anesthetics work by blocking nerve conduction. The smallest, unmyelinated nerve fibers are affected first, followed by the larger, myelinated fibers. Pain sensation is carried by small, unmyelinated C fibers and small, lightly myelinated A-delta fibers. Therefore, pain is the first sensation to be lost when a local anesthetic is administered.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pain\"}"
