    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The adrenal gland is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. The preganglionic fibers that supply the adrenal medulla arise from the thoracic spinal cord, specifically the T10-T12 segments, not the lower thoracic and upper lumbar segments. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The adrenal cortex does have a nerve supply, so option B is incorrect. The adrenal medulla also has a nerve supply, so option C is incorrect. The release of catecholamines is indeed affected by nerve supply, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
