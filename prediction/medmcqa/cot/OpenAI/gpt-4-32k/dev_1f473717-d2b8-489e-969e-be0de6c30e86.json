    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Collagen is a protein that provides structure to much of your body, including your skin, hair, nails, bones, and ligaments. It is rich in several amino acids, but the unique one is hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline is not directly incorporated during protein synthesis but is formed by post-translational modification of proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase. This modification is important for the stability of the collagen triple helix. Therefore, the estimation of collagen often involves the measurement of hydroxyproline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hydroxyproline\"}"
