    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infertility due to bilateral cornual blockage is a challenging condition. Tuboplasty (A) is a surgical procedure to repair or open blocked fallopian tubes, but it's not always successful and has a risk of ectopic pregnancy. Hydrotubation (C) is a procedure that involves flushing the fallopian tubes with a saline solution, but it's not very effective for cornual blockage. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy (D) are diagnostic procedures, not treatments. In-vitro fertilization (B) bypasses the need for the sperm to travel through the fallopian tubes, so it's the most effective treatment for this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
