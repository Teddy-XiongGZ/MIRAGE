    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin and glucagon are hormones that help regulate blood sugar levels. In general, insulin decreases blood sugar levels by promoting processes like glycogen synthesis, while glucagon increases blood sugar levels by promoting processes like glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Therefore, a low insulin to glucagon ratio would inhibit processes promoted by insulin and stimulate those promoted by glucagon. Glycogen synthesis is promoted by insulin, so it would be inhibited by a low insulin to glucagon ratio. On the other hand, glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis are all promoted by glucagon, so they would be stimulated by a low insulin to glucagon ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Glycogen synthesis\"}"
