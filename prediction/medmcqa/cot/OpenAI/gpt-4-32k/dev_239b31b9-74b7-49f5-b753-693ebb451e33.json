    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar are prepared in a way that they diverge towards the occlusal surface. This is done to ensure that the filling material can be properly placed and condensed into the cavity. If the walls were to converge towards the occlusal surface, it would be difficult to properly place and condense the filling material. The direction of the enamel rods does not dictate the direction of the cavity walls. Undermining the enamel, especially when it is very thin, can lead to fracture and is therefore avoided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Diverge toward occlusal surface\"}"
