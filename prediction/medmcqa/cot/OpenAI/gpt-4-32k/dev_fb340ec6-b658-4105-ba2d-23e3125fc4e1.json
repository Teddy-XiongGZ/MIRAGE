    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resolving power of a microscope is the ability to distinguish two points as separate entities. It depends on the size of the aperture, as a larger aperture allows more light and thus more detail. The focal length of the eyepiece also affects the resolving power, as a shorter focal length increases magnification. The wavelength of the light source used is also important, as shorter wavelengths provide higher resolution. However, the thickness of the film does not affect the resolving power of a microscope.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
