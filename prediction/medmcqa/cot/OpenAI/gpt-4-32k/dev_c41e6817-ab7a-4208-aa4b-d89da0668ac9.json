    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand the values. The normal range for pCO2 is 35-45 mm Hg, for pO2 it's 75-100 mm Hg, and for pH it's 7.35-7.45. In this case, pCO2 is lower than normal, pO2 is higher than normal, and pH is also slightly higher than normal. A low pCO2 indicates a respiratory condition, as CO2 is expelled from the body through the lungs. A high pH indicates alkalosis, which is a condition where the body fluids have too much base (alkali). Therefore, this profile indicates a respiratory alkalosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Respiratory alkalosis\"}"
