    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reactive oxygen metabolites are produced by several enzymes. Among the options, NADPH oxidase is the enzyme that is responsible for the production of superoxide by transferring electrons from NADPH inside the cell across the membrane and coupling these to molecular oxygen to produce superoxide, a reactive oxygen species. This superoxide is then converted to other reactive oxygen species. The other enzymes listed, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, are involved in the breakdown or conversion of reactive oxygen species, not their production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. NADPH oxidase\"}"
