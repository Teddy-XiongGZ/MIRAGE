Random blood sugar (B) can help identify hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can cause altered sensorium. Non-contrast CT head (D) can help identify any structural abnormalities in the brain such as tumors, hemorrhage, etc. However, a lumbar puncture (C) is an invasive procedure that is typically done to diagnose conditions like meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is not a routine test for altered sensorium and should only be done when there is a specific clinical suspicion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
