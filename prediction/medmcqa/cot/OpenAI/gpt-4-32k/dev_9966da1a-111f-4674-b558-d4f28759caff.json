    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The APGAR score is a quick test performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The 1-minute score determines how well the baby tolerated the birthing process. The 5-minute score tells the health care provider how well the baby is doing outside the mother's womb. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with 10 being the healthiest. If most of the readings are 7 or above, it means that the majority of the data points are on the higher end of the scale. This would suggest that the data is negatively skewed, as the tail of the distribution would be on the left (lower end of the scale).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Negatively skewed data\"}"
