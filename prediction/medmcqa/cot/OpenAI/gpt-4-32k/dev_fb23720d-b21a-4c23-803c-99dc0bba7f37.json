    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A vesicovaginal fistula is an abnormal fistulous tract extending between the bladder (or vesico) and the vagina that allows the continuous involuntary discharge of urine into the vaginal vault. In terms of diagnosis, cystoscopy can be used to visualize the bladder and potentially the fistula, but it may not always be visible. Urine culture is more for identifying infections, not structural issues like fistulas. Intravenous pyelogram is a type of X-ray used to look at the kidneys and ureters, not necessarily the bladder or vagina. The three swab test is a simple, inexpensive, and effective diagnostic test for vesicovaginal fistula. It involves the use of three swabs, one in the vagina, one in the bladder, and one in the rectum. The swabs are then examined for the presence of dye, which would indicate a fistula.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Three swab test\"}"
