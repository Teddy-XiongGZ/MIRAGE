    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oral mucosa is the mucous membrane lining the inside of the mouth. It is composed of stratified squamous epithelium, which is a type of epithelium composed of multiple layers of flat cells. Therefore, the answer is not keratinized squamous, as not all oral mucosa is keratinized. It is also not columnar, as this refers to a different type of epithelial cell. The answer is not simply 'squamous' as this does not specify the layered nature of the cells in the oral mucosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. stratified squamous\"}"
