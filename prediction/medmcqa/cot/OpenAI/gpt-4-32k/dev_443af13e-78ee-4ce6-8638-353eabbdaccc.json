    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pulp is the innermost part of the tooth, containing nerves and blood vessels. The outermost layer of the pulp is lined by odontoblasts, which are cells responsible for the formation of dentin, the hard tissue that lies beneath the enamel and cementum of the tooth. Fibroblasts are found in the connective tissue of the pulp, but they are not the principal secretory cells lining the pulp. Ameloblasts are responsible for the formation of enamel, but they are located in the enamel organ, not the pulp. Undifferentiated cells are stem cells that have not yet developed into a specific cell type, and while they are present in the pulp, they are not the principal secretory cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Odontoblast\"}"
