    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Next generation sequencing is a DNA sequencing technology. PCR is a method widely used to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail. Sanger's technique, also known as 'Sanger sequencing', is a method of DNA sequencing based on the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. Western blotting is a technique used to detect specific protein molecules from among a mixture of proteins. None of these techniques are primarily RNA based.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
