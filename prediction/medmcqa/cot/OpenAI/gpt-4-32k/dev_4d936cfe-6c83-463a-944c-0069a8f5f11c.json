    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a diagnostic procedure used to investigate lumps or swellings. In this technique, a thin, hollow needle is inserted into the mass for sampling of cells that, after being stained, will be examined under a microscope. FNAC can diagnose most of the carcinomas like papillary carcinoma of thyroid, carcinoma breast, and adenocarcinoma lung. However, it is not enough to diagnose follicular carcinoma of thyroid because it cannot distinguish between a benign follicular adenoma and a malignant follicular carcinoma. This is because the diagnosis of follicular carcinoma requires the demonstration of capsular and/or vascular invasion, which cannot be assessed by FNAC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
