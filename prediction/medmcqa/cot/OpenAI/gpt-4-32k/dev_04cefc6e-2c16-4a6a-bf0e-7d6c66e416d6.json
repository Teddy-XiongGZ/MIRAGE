    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Streptococcus mutans is a bacterium commonly found in the human oral cavity and is a significant contributor to tooth decay. It does this by metabolizing sugars from food debris and producing lactic acid, which demineralizes the tooth enamel, leading to caries. It does not derive energy from enamel constituents, nor does it live symbiotically with lactobacillus. It does form a biofilm, which could be considered a 'gelatinous matrix', but this is not the primary reason it causes caries. The key factor is its ability to metabolize substrate from saliva and produce acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
