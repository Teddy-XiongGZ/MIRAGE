    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about how to avoid failure of partial dentures due to poor clasp design. Stress breakers are used to distribute the force applied to the denture, but they don't directly address the clasp design. Altering tooth contours could potentially improve the fit of the denture, but it's a more invasive approach and doesn't necessarily improve the clasp design. Clasping only those teeth with fairly long crowns and normal bone support might limit the options for clasp placement and doesn't directly improve the clasp design. Using bar type clasps, however, directly addresses the clasp design and can provide a more secure and stable attachment for the denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
