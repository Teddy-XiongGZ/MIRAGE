    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In dental radiography, the angulation of the x-ray beam affects the image of the teeth on the film. If the facial root appears distal to the palatal root, it means that the x-ray beam was directed from the mesial side of the tooth. This is because the x-ray beam will project the facial root (which is closer to the beam) further away on the film, making it appear distal to the palatal root.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. From mesial side of the tooth\"}"
