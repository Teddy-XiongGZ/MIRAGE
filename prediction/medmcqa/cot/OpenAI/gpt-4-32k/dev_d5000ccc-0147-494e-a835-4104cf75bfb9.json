    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that connects the jaw to the skull. The lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for opening the jaw, protruding the mandible, and moving the mandible from side to side. If this muscle contracts excessively or spasms, it could potentially displace the articular disc beyond the articular tubercle of the TMJ, causing a dislocation. The other muscles listed (buccinator, masseter, and temporalis) are involved in other movements of the jaw and face, but not specifically in the displacement of the articular disc.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lateral pterygoid\"}"
