    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that is often used in medical emergencies to rapidly decrease blood pressure. It works by releasing nitric oxide (NO), which then activates an enzyme called guanylate cyclase. This enzyme increases the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which in turn causes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Guanylate cyclase\"}"
