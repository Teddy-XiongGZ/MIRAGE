    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingival retraction cords are used in dentistry to retract the gingiva away from the tooth to allow for better visibility and access during procedures. Some retraction cords are impregnated with chemicals to help with hemostasis (stopping bleeding). Retraction cord with 2% racemic epinephrine is contraindicated in hypertensive patients because epinephrine can raise blood pressure. Retraction cord with 8% aluminium chloride is also not recommended because it can cause tissue irritation and is not as effective in controlling bleeding. Therefore, a plain retraction cord without any chemicals would be the safest option for a hypertensive patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
