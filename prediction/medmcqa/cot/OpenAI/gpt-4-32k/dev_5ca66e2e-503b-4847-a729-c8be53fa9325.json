    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that can increase in response to inflammation or infection. Typhoid is a bacterial infection, so it makes sense that it would cause an increase in monocytes. Sub-Acute Bacterial Endocarditis is also a bacterial infection, so it could potentially cause an increase in monocytes as well. Parasitic infections and Hodgkin's Lymphoma, on the other hand, are not typically associated with an increase in monocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Sub-Acute Bacterial Endocarditis\"}"
