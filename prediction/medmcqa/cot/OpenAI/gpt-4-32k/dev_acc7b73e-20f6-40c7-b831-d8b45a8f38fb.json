    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. Prognostic indicators are factors that can affect the outcome of the disease. Female sex is not a poor prognostic indicator for ALL. A leukocyte count less than 50,000 is not a poor prognostic indicator either. Age greater than 1 year is not a poor prognostic indicator, in fact, it's the opposite - very young age (less than 1 year) and older age (over 10 years) are associated with poorer prognosis. Hypodiploidy, on the other hand, is a poor prognostic indicator. Hypodiploidy refers to a condition where there are fewer than the normal number of chromosomes. In the context of ALL, hypodiploidy is associated with a poorer prognosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
