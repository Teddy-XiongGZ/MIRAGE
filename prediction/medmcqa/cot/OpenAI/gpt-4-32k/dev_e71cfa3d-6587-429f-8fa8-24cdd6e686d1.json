    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biomechanical preparation is a process in endodontics where the root canal is cleaned and shaped. After enlarging the apical constriction to a 50 sized instrument, the next step would not be to use a reverse filing technique (A) as this is not typically done in this stage. Reinstrumenting with a larger instrument 1 mm short of previous preparation (B) is also not the next step, as we have already achieved the desired size. Filling with a 40 sized cone (D) would not be appropriate because the apical constriction has been enlarged to a 50 sized instrument. Therefore, the next logical step would be to fit a 50 mm cone and condense carefully (C). This is because the cone should match the size of the prepared canal for optimal obturation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
