    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is used to decrease intraocular pressure. Methazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which reduces the production of aqueous humor, thereby decreasing intraocular pressure. Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, which decreases aqueous humor production and increases uveoscleral outflow, thereby reducing intraocular pressure. Dexamethasone, however, is a corticosteroid, which can actually increase intraocular pressure, especially in steroid responders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Dexamethasone\"}"
