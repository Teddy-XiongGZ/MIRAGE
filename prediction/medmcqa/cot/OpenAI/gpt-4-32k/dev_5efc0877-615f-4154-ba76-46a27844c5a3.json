    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adrenaline is often added to local anaesthetic solutions to achieve haemostasis and vasoconstriction at the surgical site. This helps to prolong the duration of the anaesthetic effect and reduce systemic toxicity. The concentration of adrenaline typically used in local anaesthetic solutions is 1:200000. However, for achieving haemostasis and vasoconstriction, a higher concentration is needed. The most commonly used concentration for this purpose is 1:80000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
