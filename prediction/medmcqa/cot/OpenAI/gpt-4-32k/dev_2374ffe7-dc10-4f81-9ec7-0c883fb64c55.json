    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Articaine is indeed an amide local anesthetic that is metabolized in both the plasma and liver, so option A is true. The plasma half-life of articaine is about 20 minutes, not 90 minutes, so option B is false. Articaine is known for its ability to produce adequate anesthesia through infiltration, even in areas of the mouth where this is typically difficult, such as the posterior mandible, so option C is true. Lastly, the fact that articaine is broken down more quickly than other local anesthetics contributes to its lower toxicity, so option D is also true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
