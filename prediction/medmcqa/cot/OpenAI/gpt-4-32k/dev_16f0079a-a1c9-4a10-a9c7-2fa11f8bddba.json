    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Swyer syndrome is a condition that affects sexual development. People with this condition are typically born with female external genitalia but have male (XY) chromosomes. They do not have functional gonads (ovaries or testes), which leads to primary infertility. Therefore, they cannot be fertile with surrogacy or ovum donation. However, they can carry a pregnancy with a donated egg and hormonal support. Gonadectomy is often recommended because there's a high risk of gonadoblastoma, a form of cancer, but it's not indicated for all patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Presents with primary feility\"}"
