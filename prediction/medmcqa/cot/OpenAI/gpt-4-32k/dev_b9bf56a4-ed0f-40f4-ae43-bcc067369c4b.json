    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Work hardening, also known as strain hardening, is the process by which a metal becomes stronger and harder through permanent deformation. This is a result of dislocation movements and dislocation generation within the crystal structure of the material. So, A. Increase in strength is correct. However, this process also reduces the ductility of the material, making it more brittle and less able to withstand further deformation without breaking, which means B. Decrease in ductility is also correct. Furthermore, the process of work hardening can lead to the development of internal stresses within the material, as the deformation causes changes in the arrangement of atoms in the crystal structure, leading to C. Development of internal stresses. Therefore, all of the options are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above\"}"
