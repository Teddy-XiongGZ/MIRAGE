    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. It is mediated by the immune system. 5-hydroxytryptamine, also known as serotonin, is a neurotransmitter that can be involved in allergic reactions, but it is not the primary mediator of anaphylaxis. Heparin is an anticoagulant, not a mediator of anaphylaxis.

Therefore, none of these options are the primary mediators of anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of these\"}"
