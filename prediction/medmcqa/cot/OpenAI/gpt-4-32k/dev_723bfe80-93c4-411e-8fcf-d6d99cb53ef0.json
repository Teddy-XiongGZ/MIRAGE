    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When placing dental implants, it's important to have enough space between them to ensure proper healing and stability. The general rule of thumb is to have at least 3 mm of space between each implant, and 1.5 mm of space between an implant and a natural tooth or the edge of the ridge. So, for two 4 mm implants, we would need 8 mm for the implants themselves, 3 mm of space between them, and 1.5 mm of space on either side. Adding these together, we get 14 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
