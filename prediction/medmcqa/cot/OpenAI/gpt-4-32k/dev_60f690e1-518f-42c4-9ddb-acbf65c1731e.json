    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel calcification is the process of hardening the enamel, the outermost layer of the teeth. This process begins at the Dentinoenamel Junction (DEJ), which is the boundary between the enamel and the underlying dentin. The enamel matrix is involved in the formation of enamel, but calcification starts at the DEJ. The root and the Cementoenamel Junction (CEJ) are not the starting points for enamel calcification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. DEJ\"}"
