    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar levels. It's often used to treat severe hypoglycemia, a condition that occurs when there's too much insulin and not enough glucose in the blood. Large for date babies, infants of diabetic mothers, and those with nesidioblastosis can all benefit from glucagon injections because these conditions can cause hypoglycemia. However, galactosemia is a different type of metabolic disorder that involves an inability to metabolize the sugar galactose, leading to its accumulation in the body. Glucagon would not be effective in this case because the problem is not related to insulin or glucose levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Galactosemia\"}"
