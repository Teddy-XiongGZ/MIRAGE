    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of packing denture base resin involves placing the resin in a flask, which is then closed to apply pressure and heat, causing the resin to polymerize and form the denture base. If the flask is not closed sufficiently during this process, the resin may not be compressed adequately. This could lead to an increase in the vertical dimension of the denture base, as the resin would have more space to expand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increase in vertical dimension\"}"
