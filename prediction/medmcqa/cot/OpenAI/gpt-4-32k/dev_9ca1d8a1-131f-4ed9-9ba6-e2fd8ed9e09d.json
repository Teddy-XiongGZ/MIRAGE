    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best retainer choice for a posterior abutment with certain conditions: acceptable crown root ratios, average crown length, and normal esthetic requirement. A full crown is often the best choice for posterior teeth because it provides the most coverage and support, especially when the crown root ratio and crown length are average. Partial veneer crowns, resin veneers, and PFM (Porcelain Fused to Metal) are typically used for anterior teeth or when there are specific esthetic considerations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Full crown\"}"
