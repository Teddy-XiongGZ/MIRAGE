    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method widely used to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail. It involves three major steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension. DNA Polymerase (choice A) is used in the extension step to synthesize new strands of DNA. Taq polymerase (choice B) is a type of DNA polymerase frequently used in PCR because it is stable at high temperatures needed for denaturation. A DNA template (choice D) is the original DNA strand that is being copied. Dideoxyribonucleotides (choice C), however, are not used in PCR. They are used in a different process called Sanger sequencing, which is a method of DNA sequencing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
