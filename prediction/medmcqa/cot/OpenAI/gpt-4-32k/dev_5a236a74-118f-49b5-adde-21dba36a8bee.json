    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alveolar cleft surgery is a procedure to repair a cleft in the gum, which is a common congenital defect. The graft for this surgery is usually taken from the patient's own body, a process known as autografting. The iliac crest, which is the curved ridge at the top of the pelvic bone, is a common site for bone grafts due to its accessibility and the volume of bone available. The choice between the anterior and posterior iliac crest often depends on the surgeon's preference and the specific needs of the patient. However, the anterior iliac crest is often preferred because it is easier to access and has a lower risk of complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Anterior iliac crest\"}"
