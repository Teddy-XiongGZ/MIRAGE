    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Brittle bone syndrome, also known as Osteogenesis Imperfecta, is a genetic disorder that affects the body's production of collagen, a protein that helps to strengthen bones. The condition is caused by a mutation in one of the genes responsible for making collagen. This mutation can lead to the production of low-quality collagen or a reduced amount of it, which in turn leads to weak and brittle bones. Therefore, the answer is not related to increased osteoclastic or fibroblastic activity, nor to the polymerisation of collagen, but to the improper synthesis of procollagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
