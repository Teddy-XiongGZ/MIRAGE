    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sterilization of a hand piece is a necessary process to ensure the hygiene and safety of medical procedures. However, repeated sterilization can lead to wear and tear of the hand piece. This can result in the loss of torque, which is the rotational force of the hand piece. Rusting is more related to exposure to moisture and oxygen, not sterilization. Fibre loss is not relevant in this context. Turbine wear could be a result but it's not as direct as loss of torque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
