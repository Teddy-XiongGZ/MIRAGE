    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria. The life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum involves several stages. The schizont and late trophozoite stages are part of the intraerythrocytic cycle, which occurs in the human host. During these stages, the parasites are not typically seen in the peripheral blood smear because they adhere to the capillary endothelium, a process known as sequestration. This sequestration allows the parasites to avoid the spleen, which would otherwise destroy them. The other options are not correct because these stages are not sequestered in the spleen, they are not removed due to antigen-antibody reactions, and they are not seen in mosquito blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
