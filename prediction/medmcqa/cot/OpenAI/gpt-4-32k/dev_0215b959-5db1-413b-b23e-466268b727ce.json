    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular primary second molar is a tooth in the lower jaw, typically in children. The tooth has several cusps, or pointed parts. The ML (mesiolingual) cusp is indeed the largest, and the distobuccal (DB) is the smallest. Therefore, option A is correct. Option B is incorrect because the buccal and lingual cusps are not all the same size. Option C is incorrect because the DB is not the largest cusp, it's the smallest. Therefore, option D is also incorrect because not all of the statements are true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
