    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Porcelain denture teeth are known for their durability and resistance to wear and tear. They have a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than acrylic teeth, which means they are less likely to change shape or size with temperature changes. Porcelain teeth also have a higher abrasion resistance than enamel, which makes them more durable and long-lasting. However, they require more inter alveolar clearance than acrylic teeth due to their rigidity and size. Lastly, porcelain has a higher abrasion resistance than gold, as gold is a softer material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Have a higher abrasion resistance than gold\" }"
