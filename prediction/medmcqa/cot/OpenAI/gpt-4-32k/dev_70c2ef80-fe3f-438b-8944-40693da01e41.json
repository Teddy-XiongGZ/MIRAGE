    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Marginal adaptation refers to the fit of the restoration along the margins of the cavity preparation. A moisture-free environment (A) is important to prevent contamination of the bonding surface, but it doesn't directly improve marginal adaptation. Application of pressure (B) can help in condensing the material but it doesn't necessarily improve the marginal adaptation. Acid etching (C) is a technique used to increase the surface area for bonding and improve retention, but it doesn't directly improve marginal adaptation. Continued packing (D) of the composite material into the cavity can help to ensure that the material adapts well to the cavity walls and margins, thereby improving marginal adaptation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
