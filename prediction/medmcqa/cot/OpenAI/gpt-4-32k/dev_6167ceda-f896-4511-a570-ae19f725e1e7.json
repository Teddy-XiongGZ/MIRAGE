    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is a hormone that is involved in controlling blood sugar levels by promoting the breakdown of glycogen in the liver into glucose. It also promotes the breakdown of fats in adipose tissue. The enzyme that is responsible for this breakdown of fats is hormone-sensitive lipase. Lipoprotein lipase is involved in the metabolism of lipoproteins and is not directly controlled by glucagon. Gastric lipase is involved in the digestion of fats in the stomach and is not controlled by glucagon. Pancreatic lipase is involved in the digestion of fats in the small intestine and is not controlled by glucagon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Hormone-sensitive lipase\"}"
