    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific occlusal curve in dentistry. The Curve of Spee is the curve of the mandibular arch in an anterior to posterior direction, which is not what the question is asking. The Monson curve is a theoretical curve that each cusp and incisal edge touches a sphere of a specific size, which is also not what the question is asking. The Catenary curve is the curve of the maxillary arch in an anterior to posterior direction, which is not what the question is asking. The Wilson curve is the curve of the arch in a buccal to lingual direction, which matches the description in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Wilson curve\"}"
