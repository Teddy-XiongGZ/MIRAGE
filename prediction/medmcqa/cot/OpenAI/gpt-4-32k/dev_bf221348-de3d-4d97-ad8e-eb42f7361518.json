    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fracture susceptibility of a tool made of the same material and size depends on its shape. A tool with a more complex shape or more corners is more likely to fracture because the stress concentration is higher at the corners. Comparing the options, a triangular reamer has three corners, a rhomboid cross section file has four corners, a square cross section file also has four corners, but a Headstrom file has a spiral shape which has more stress points.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Headstrom file\"}"
