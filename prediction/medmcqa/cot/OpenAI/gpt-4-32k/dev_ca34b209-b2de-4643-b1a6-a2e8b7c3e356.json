    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An occluded submandibular salivary duct is a condition where the duct that carries saliva from the submandibular gland to the mouth is blocked. Palpation might help to feel the swelling but it won't give a clear picture of the occlusion. Thermography is used to measure temperature differences on the surface of the body and is not suitable for observing an occluded salivary duct. An occlusal X-ray is a type of dental X-ray that provides a clear view of the upper and lower teeth in the bite position, but it's not the best method to observe a salivary duct. Sialography, on the other hand, is a radiographic examination of the salivary glands. It can be used to visualize and diagnose problems in the salivary ducts, including blockages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
