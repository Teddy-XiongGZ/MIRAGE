    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate of drug absorption in a plasma concentration graph is given by the maximum concentration of the drug in the plasma (Cmax) and the time it takes to reach this maximum concentration (Tmax). The Cmax gives us the highest concentration that the drug reaches in the body after administration, and Tmax gives us the time it takes to reach this concentration. Therefore, both of these parameters are needed to determine the rate of drug absorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Tmax and Cmax\"}"
