    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Primary teeth, also known as baby teeth, usually have natural spaces between them. This is known as physiological spacing and it allows room for the larger permanent teeth to erupt in the future. If there is a lack of spacing in primary teeth, it means that the teeth are in close contact with each other. This could potentially lead to crowding when the permanent teeth start to erupt because there might not be enough space to accommodate the larger permanent teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Crowding in permanent teeth\"}"
