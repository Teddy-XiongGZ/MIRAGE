    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibrous dysplasia is a bone disorder in which fibrous tissue develops in place of normal bone, leading to weak areas of bone. The treatment of fibrous dysplasia is usually focused on managing symptoms, as there is no cure for the disease. Radical resection of the lesion is not typically done because it can lead to significant morbidity. Radiation therapy is not used because it can potentially lead to malignant transformation. Cryosurgery is not a standard treatment for fibrous dysplasia. However, if the lesion is small, it can be dissected, and if it is large, cosmetic surgery may be carried out to improve the appearance and function of the affected area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
