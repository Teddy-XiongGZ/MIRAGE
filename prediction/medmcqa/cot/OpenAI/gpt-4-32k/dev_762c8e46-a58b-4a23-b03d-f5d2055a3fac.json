    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A lateral sliding flap is a periodontal surgical procedure used to cover denuded root surfaces. The procedure involves the use of local tissue to cover the exposed root. After 6 years, the root surface would have been covered by epithelium, not PDL fibers. PDL fibers attach to cementum, not dentin, but in this case, the root has been denuded for a long time, so it's unlikely for PDL fibers to reattach to the cementum. Co-adaptation to the remaining fibers is not a likely outcome of this procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Epithelium adjacent to previously denuded root surface\"}"
