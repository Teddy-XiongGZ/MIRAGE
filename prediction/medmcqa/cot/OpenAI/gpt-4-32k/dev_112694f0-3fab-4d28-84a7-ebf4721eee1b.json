    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bur efficiency is determined by several factors. The spiral angle affects the cutting efficiency and the removal of debris. The head length and diameter affect the surface area that can be worked on and thus the efficiency. The crosscut design also affects the cutting efficiency. However, the neck diameter does not directly affect the bur's efficiency as it does not participate in the cutting process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Neck diameter\"}"
