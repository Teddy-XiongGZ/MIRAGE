    "First, let's break down each of the options: A. Minor scalp abrasions and subgaleal hematomas in new born are more frequent than forceps - This is true. Ventouse, or vacuum extraction, is known to cause minor scalp injuries and subgaleal hematomas more frequently than forceps. B. Can be applied when foetal head is above the level of ischial spine - This is not true. The fetal head should be at or below the level of the ischial spines for ventouse to be used. C. Maternal trauma is more frequent than forceps - This is not true. Ventouse is associated with less maternal trauma compared to forceps. D. Can not be used when fetal head is not fully rotated - This is not true. Ventouse can be used even when the fetal head is not fully rotated. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is A. So, the JSON output would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ventouse, or vacuum extraction, is known to cause minor scalp injuries and subgaleal hematomas more frequently than forceps. The fetal head should be at or below the level of the ischial spines for ventouse to be used, not above. Ventouse is associated with less maternal trauma compared to forceps, not more. Ventouse can be used even when the fetal head is not fully rotated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
