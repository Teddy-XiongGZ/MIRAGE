    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Jaundice is a condition characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes due to high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Urobilinogen is a byproduct of bilirubin metabolism that is excreted in the urine. In obstructive jaundice, such as that caused by gallstones, the flow of bilirubin from the liver to the intestines is blocked. This means that less bilirubin reaches the intestines to be converted into urobilinogen by intestinal bacteria. As a result, less urobilinogen is available to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream and excreted in the urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Completely absent\"}"
