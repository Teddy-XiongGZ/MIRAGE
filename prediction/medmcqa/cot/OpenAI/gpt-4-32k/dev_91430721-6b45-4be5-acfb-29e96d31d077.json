    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a type of flow that occurs when a material turns to liquid upon applying critical shear stress. This is a characteristic of a Bingham body, which behaves as a rigid body at low shear stresses but flows as a viscous fluid at high shear stresses. Newtonian bodies have a linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate, which is not what the question describes. Dilatant and pseudoplastic materials also do not fit the description given in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Bingham body behaviour\"}"
