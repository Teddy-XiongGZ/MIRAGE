    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphoblastic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is a type of cancer that starts in cells that become certain white blood cells (called lymphocytes) in the bone marrow. The cancer (leukemia) cells start in the bone marrow but then go into the blood. In CLL/SLL, the leukemia cells often build up slowly. Over time, these cancer cells can crowd out the normal cells in the bone marrow and lead to fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. CLL/SLL arises from mature B cells, not naive B cells, centrocytes of germinal center, or progenitor B-cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Mature B cell\"}"
