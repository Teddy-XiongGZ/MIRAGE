    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Streptococci, specifically Streptococcus mutans, are known to contribute to dental caries. They do this by adhering to the tooth surface and forming a biofilm. This biofilm is made up of extracellular polysaccharides, which the bacteria produce. However, the caries development is not due to the production of these polysaccharides alone. The bacteria also metabolize sugars, producing acid as a byproduct. This acid demineralizes the tooth enamel, leading to caries. Therefore, both options B and C are partially correct. However, the fermentation of carbohydrates, which is the process that leads to acid production, is the key factor in caries development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Ferment carbohydrates\"}"
