    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has carcinoma of the larynx involving multiple structures on the left side, including the false cords, arytenoid, and aryepiglottic folds. However, the true cords are still mobile bilaterally, which suggests that the cancer has not spread to these structures. Given the extent of the disease, a partial laryngectomy, either vertical or horizontal, may not be sufficient to remove all of the cancer. Radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy could be an option, but it might not be as effective as surgery in this case. Therefore, a total laryngectomy, which involves the removal of the entire larynx, would be the most appropriate treatment option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Total laryngectomy\"}"
