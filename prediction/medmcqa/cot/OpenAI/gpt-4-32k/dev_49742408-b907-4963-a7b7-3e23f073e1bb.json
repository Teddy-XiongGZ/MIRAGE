    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of platelets, also known as thrombocytes, in the blood. Platelets are necessary for normal blood clotting. When a patient with thrombocytopenia needs to undergo an invasive procedure, it's important to ensure that their platelet count is high enough to prevent excessive bleeding. The general guideline is to aim for a platelet count of at least 50,000 per microliter of blood for most invasive procedures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 50,000\"}"
