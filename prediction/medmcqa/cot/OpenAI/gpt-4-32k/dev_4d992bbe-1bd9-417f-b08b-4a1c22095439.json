    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Codominance is a form of dominance where the alleles of a gene pair in a heterozygote are fully expressed. This results in offspring with a phenotype that is neither dominant nor recessive. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that an individual only needs one copy of the dominant allele to express the trait, and it can be passed from either parent. Recessive inheritance requires two copies of a gene to express a trait, and it can also be passed from either parent. Mitochondrial inheritance, however, is always passed from the mother to the child because the mitochondria in the sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
