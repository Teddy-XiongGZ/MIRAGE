This can lead to complications such as fetal bradycardia due to uteroplacental insufficiency, vaginal bleeding due to the rupture of blood vessels, and maternal bradycardia due to pain or blood loss. Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is not typically associated with scar dehiscence as the urinary system is not directly involved in the process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hematuria\"}"
