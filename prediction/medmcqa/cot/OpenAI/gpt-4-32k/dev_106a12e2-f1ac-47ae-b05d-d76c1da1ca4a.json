    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyaline membrane disease, also known as respiratory distress syndrome, is a condition that primarily affects premature infants. It is characterized by the lack of surfactant, a substance that helps keep the tiny air sacs in the lungs open. This lack of surfactant leads to the collapse of these air sacs, reducing the functional residual capacity (FRC) of the lungs. The closing volume is the lung volume at which small airways begin to collapse during expiration. In normal conditions, the FRC is greater than the closing volume. However, in conditions like hyaline membrane disease, the FRC can be smaller than the closing volume due to the collapse of the air sacs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
