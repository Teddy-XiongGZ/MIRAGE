    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A bonding agent is used to create a bond between two surfaces. In dentistry, it is used to bond restorative materials to tooth structures. The effectiveness of a bonding agent is determined by its ability to wet the surface it is applied to. The wetting angle is a measure of this ability. A smaller wetting angle indicates better wetting, which means the bonding agent can spread more effectively over the surface, creating a stronger bond. Therefore, for a bonding agent to be effective, the wetting angle should be minimum with the dental hard tissue, which includes both dentin and enamel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
