    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metal base dentures are known for their durability and strength, which can lead to increased tissue tolerance as they distribute the forces of mastication more evenly across the gums. They are not necessarily easier to produce in a laboratory, nor are they easier to rebase or reline. In fact, they can be more complex due to the materials and techniques involved. Lastly, metal base dentures are typically more expensive than their acrylic counterparts, so they do not increase restorative cost.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
