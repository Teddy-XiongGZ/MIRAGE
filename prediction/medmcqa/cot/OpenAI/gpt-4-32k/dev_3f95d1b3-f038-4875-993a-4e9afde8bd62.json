    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Selenocysteine is a unique amino acid that is not directly encoded by the standard genetic code. Instead, it is encoded by a stop codon, specifically UGA, which is normally a signal to end protein synthesis. However, in the presence of a specific sequence in the mRNA, known as a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS), the UGA codon is reinterpreted by the cell and instead of signaling the end of protein synthesis, it codes for the amino acid selenocysteine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
