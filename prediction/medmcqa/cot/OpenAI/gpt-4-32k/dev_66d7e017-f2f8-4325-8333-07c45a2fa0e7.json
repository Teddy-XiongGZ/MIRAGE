    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stretch fibers, also known as muscle spindles, are sensory receptors within the belly of a muscle that primarily detect changes in the length of the muscle. They convey length information to the central nervous system via sensory neurons. These sensory neurons are typically large, myelinated fibers that allow for rapid conduction of nerve impulses. Among the options, A delta fibers and C fibers are both involved in pain and temperature sensation, not muscle stretch. Unmyelinated fibers are typically slower in conducting impulses. Gamma fibers, on the other hand, are involved in the regulation of muscle tone and are associated with the muscle spindle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Gamma fiber\"}"
