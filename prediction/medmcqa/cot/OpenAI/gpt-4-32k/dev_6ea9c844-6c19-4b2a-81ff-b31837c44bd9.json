    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder that causes the body to excrete too much protein in the urine. It is often caused by damage to the clusters of small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess water from the blood. The most common gene defect in idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome is NPHS2, which encodes for the protein podocin. Podocin is a key component of the filtration barrier in the kidney. Mutations in this gene can lead to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. NPHS 2\"}"
