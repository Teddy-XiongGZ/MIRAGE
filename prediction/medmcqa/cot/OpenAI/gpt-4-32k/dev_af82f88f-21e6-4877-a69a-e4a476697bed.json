    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycosylated Hb, also known as Hemoglobin A1c, is a form of hemoglobin that is chemically linked to a sugar. Most monosaccharides, including glucose, galactose and fructose, spontaneously bond with hemoglobin, when present in the bloodstream of humans. The binding of glucose to hemoglobin is on a non-enzymatic pathway. Hence, the term glycosylated hemoglobin. The higher the level of glucose concentration in the blood, the higher the level of glycosylated hemoglobin. It is a long-term measure of glucose control and is not affected by daily fluctuations in the blood glucose concentration. This makes it a useful tool for the assessment of the effectiveness of therapy in diabetic patients. Cushing disease, Hyperparathyroidism, and Addison disease are not directly related to blood glucose levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
