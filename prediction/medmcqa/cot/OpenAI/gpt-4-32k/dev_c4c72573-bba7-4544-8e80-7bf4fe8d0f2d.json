The instruments used in this procedure include a coblation wand, which uses radiofrequency energy to remove tissue; a bipolar cautery, which uses electricity to stop bleeding; and a harmonic scalpel, which uses ultrasonic energy to cut tissue and seal blood vessels. A microdebrider, on the other hand, is typically used in sinus surgery to remove tissue and is not typically used in a tonsillectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
