    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito. In the mosquito's stomach, the parasites multiply and develop into a form called sporozoites, which are injected into the human host when the mosquito bites. However, in the case of transfusion-associated malaria, the disease is transmitted through infected blood, not a mosquito bite. The form of the parasite that is present in the blood and responsible for the symptoms of malaria is the merozoite, which invades the red blood cells and multiplies, causing the symptoms of malaria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Merozoites\"}"
