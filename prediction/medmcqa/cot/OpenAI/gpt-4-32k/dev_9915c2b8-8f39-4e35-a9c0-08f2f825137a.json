    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oxygenases are enzymes that incorporate oxygen from molecular oxygen (O2) into organic substrates. There are two types of oxygenases: monooxygenases, which incorporate one atom of oxygen, and dioxygenases, which incorporate two atoms of oxygen. Therefore, both options A and B are correct. Oxygenases are also involved in the hydroxylation of steroids, making option C correct. However, oxygenases are not typically involved in the carboxylation of drugs. Carboxylation is usually facilitated by carboxylases, not oxygenases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
