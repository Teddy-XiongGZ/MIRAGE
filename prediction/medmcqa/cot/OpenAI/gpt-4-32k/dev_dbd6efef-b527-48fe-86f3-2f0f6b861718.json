    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A bony defect is a gap or missing part in the bone that needs to be filled. The best way to fill this gap would be with a material that is biocompatible, osteoconductive, and osteoinductive. Hydroxy apatite (A) is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite, but it is not as effective as bone grafts. Donor grafts (B) and xenografts (C) are options, but they carry the risk of disease transmission and rejection by the body. Autografts (D), which are grafts taken from the patient's own body, are considered the gold standard because they are biocompatible, osteoconductive, and osteoinductive, and they carry no risk of disease transmission.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
