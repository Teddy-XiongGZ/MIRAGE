    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A Class II cavity is a type of dental cavity that affects the proximal surfaces of premolars and molars. The maxillary first molar has five cusps, which include the mesiobuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, distolingual, and the fifth cusp. The pulp horns correspond to the cusps, so when preparing a Class II cavity, the pulp horns that are most likely to get exposed are the ones that correspond to the surfaces being treated. In this case, the surfaces being treated are the mesial surfaces, so the pulp horns that are most likely to get exposed are the mesiolingual and mesiobuccal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Mesiolingual and mesiobuccal\"}"
