    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An Ellis class III fracture involves the enamel, dentin, and pulp. The first step in managing this type of fracture is to take a radiograph to assess the extent of the damage. After that, a Cvek's pulpotomy is usually performed. This procedure involves removing 1-3mm of the pulp tissue that has been exposed by the fracture. This is done to preserve the vitality of the remaining pulp tissue. A pulpectomy, on the other hand, involves the complete removal of the pulp tissue, which is not necessary in this case. Indirect pulp capping is used when the pulp is not exposed, and observation and restoration with composite resin is not the first step in managing this type of fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
