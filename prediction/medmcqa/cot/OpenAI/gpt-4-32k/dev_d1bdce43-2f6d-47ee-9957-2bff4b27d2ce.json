    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of sperm formation, also known as spermatogenesis, begins with spermatogonia, which are the germ cells in the testes. These spermatogonia undergo mitosis to form spermatocytes. The spermatocytes then undergo meiosis to form spermatids. Finally, the spermatids mature into spermatozoa. Therefore, the correct sequential order is Spermatogonia (1), Spermatocyte (2), Spermatids (3), Spermatozoa (4).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
