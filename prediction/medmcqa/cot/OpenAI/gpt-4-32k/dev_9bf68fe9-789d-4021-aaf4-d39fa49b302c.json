    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Niacin and riboflavin are both types of B vitamins. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is a component of the coenzyme NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are involved in redox reactions. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a component of the coenzymes FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) and FMN (flavin mononucleotide), which also participate in redox reactions. Therefore, both niacin and riboflavin are involved in redox reactions, not in transamination, methyl group transfer, or amine group transfer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
