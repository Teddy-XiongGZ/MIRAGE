    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a common complication of surgery. The rate of SSIs varies depending on the type of surgery and the cleanliness of the wound. Clean-contaminated wounds are those that are made under sterile conditions but involve a body cavity that normally contains bacteria, such as the mouth or colon. The SSI rate for clean-contaminated wounds is higher than for clean wounds, but lower than for contaminated or dirty/infected wounds. Therefore, the percentage of SSI rate in patients with a clean contaminated wound is not as low as 1-2%, but it's also not as high as 20-30%. It's somewhere in between.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 10- 20 %\"}"
