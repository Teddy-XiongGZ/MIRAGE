    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has primary amenorrhea, which means she has never had a menstrual period. She has normal breast development, indicating normal estrogen levels, but minimal pubic hair, suggesting a lack of androgens. This is not consistent with premature ovarian failure or Turner's syndrome, both of which would typically present with underdeveloped breasts. Miillerian agenesis could cause amenorrhea, but would not explain the lack of pubic hair. Androgen insensitivity syndrome, however, would explain both the amenorrhea and the lack of pubic hair, as individuals with this condition are genetically male but their bodies do not respond to androgens, leading to a female appearance but no menstruation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Androgen insensitivity\"}"
