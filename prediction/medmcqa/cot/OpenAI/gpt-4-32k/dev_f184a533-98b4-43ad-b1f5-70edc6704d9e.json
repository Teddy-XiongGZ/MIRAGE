    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heavy forces on the periodontal ligament can cause damage to the tissues. This damage can lead to a process called hyalinization, which is the formation of a hyaline-like substance in the tissues. This is a protective response of the body to prevent further damage. Osteoclastic activity around the tooth and crest bone resorption are also possible, but these are secondary effects that occur after the initial hyalinization. Osteoblastic activity, on the other hand, is associated with bone formation, not damage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
