    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Odontogenic cysts are cysts that form in the oral cavity, often related to the teeth. The most common treatment for these cysts is to remove them completely, which is done through a procedure called enucleation. Incision and drainage may be used as a temporary measure to relieve symptoms, but it does not remove the cyst. Sclerosing solution is not typically used for odontogenic cysts. Marsupialisation is a procedure where the cyst is opened and sutured open to allow it to drain, but it also does not remove the cyst.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Enucleation\"}"
