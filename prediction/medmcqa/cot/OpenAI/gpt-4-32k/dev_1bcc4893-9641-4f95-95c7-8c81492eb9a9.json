    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hysteresis refers to the phenomenon where the value of a physical property lags behind changes in the effect causing it. In dentistry, it is often associated with materials that change their state with temperature changes. Among the options, reversible hydrocolloid is known to undergo hysteresis as it can change from a gel to a sol state with temperature changes and then back to a gel state when cooled.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
