    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds and protects the fetus during pregnancy. It is initially formed from maternal plasma and later by the fetal kidneys. The placenta plays a role in the exchange of nutrients and waste between the mother and fetus, but it does not produce amniotic fluid. The chorion and amnion are membranes that surround the fetus, but they also do not produce the fluid. Therefore, the fetus is the main producer of amniotic fluid, especially in the later stages of pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fetus\"}"
