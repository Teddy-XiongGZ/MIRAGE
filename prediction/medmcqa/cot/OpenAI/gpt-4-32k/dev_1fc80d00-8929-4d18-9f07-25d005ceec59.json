    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can lead to dizzy spells (vertigo) and hearing loss. In most cases, Meniere's disease affects only one ear. Intractable vertigo, which is vertigo that doesn't respond to other treatments, can be a debilitating symptom of Meniere's disease. The goal of surgery is to reduce the severity and frequency of vertigo attacks. Surgical labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy both involve removing part or all of the inner ear, which can lead to total hearing loss in the affected ear. Endolymphatic sac decompression surgery aims to reduce excess fluid levels in the inner ear, but it doesn't always stop vertigo attacks. Cochleosacculotomy is a less common procedure that involves making an incision in the inner ear to drain excess fluid. However, it's not typically the first choice for treating intractable vertigo in Meniere's disease patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Surgical Labyinthectomy\"}"
