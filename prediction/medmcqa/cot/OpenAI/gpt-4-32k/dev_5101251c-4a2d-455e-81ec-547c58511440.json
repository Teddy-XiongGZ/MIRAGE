    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bronchiectasis is a condition where the bronchial tubes of your lungs are permanently damaged, widened, and thickened. These damaged air passages allow bacteria and mucus to build up and pool in your lungs. This results in frequent infections and blockages of the airways. On auscultation, one would expect to hear abnormal breath sounds. Late inspiratory crackles are typically associated with interstitial lung diseases, not bronchiectasis. Bibasilar crepts are usually associated with conditions like heart failure. Both early and late inspiratory crackles are not typically associated with bronchiectasis. Tubular breath sounds, also known as bronchial breath sounds, are abnormal breath sounds that are high-pitched and longer than vesicular sounds. They are usually heard over the trachea and bronchi, and are indicative of bronchiectasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tubular breath sounds\"}"
