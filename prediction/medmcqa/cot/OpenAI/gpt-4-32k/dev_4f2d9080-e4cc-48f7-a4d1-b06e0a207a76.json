    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sydenham's chorea is a neurological disorder of childhood resulting from infection via Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the bacterium that causes rheumatic fever. The best investigation to prove rheumatic etiology would be to look for evidence of a recent streptococcal infection. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) is an antibody targeted against streptolysin O, a toxin produced by group A streptococcus. It is used to confirm a diagnosis of a streptococcal infection or rheumatic fever. Antistreptolysin S is not used in clinical practice. Throat culture would only be useful if the patient currently has a streptococcal infection, which is not the case here. PCR for M protein is not typically used in clinical practice for this purpose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Antistreptolysin O\"}"
