    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a condition that results in damage to the heart muscle. When this happens, certain enzymes that are normally found within the cells of the heart muscle are released into the bloodstream. These enzymes include Creatine phosphokinase-MB (CPK-MB), Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT or AST), and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Therefore, all of these enzymes can be elevated in the plasma following an MI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above\"}"
