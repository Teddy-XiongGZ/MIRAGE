    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a parasite that can be identified through stool microscopy by the presence of cysts. Entamoeba dyspar, Balantidium coli, and Giardia lambia all form cysts that can be seen in stool samples. However, Taenia solium, a tapeworm, does not form cysts but rather eggs or proglottids.
