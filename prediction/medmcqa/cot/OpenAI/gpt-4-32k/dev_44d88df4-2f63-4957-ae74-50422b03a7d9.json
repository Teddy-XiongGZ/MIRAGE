    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cephalosporins are a type of antibiotic. They do show cross sensitivity with penicillins, meaning if a person is allergic to penicillin, they may also be allergic to cephalosporins. This is because the chemical structure of these two types of antibiotics is similar. Cephalosporins are also penicillinase resistant, which means they are not broken down by the enzyme penicillinase that some bacteria produce to resist the effects of penicillin. They are used in a variety of infections, including upper respiratory tract infections. However, cephalosporins are not inactive against anaerobes. Some cephalosporins, especially the later generations, do have activity against anaerobes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
