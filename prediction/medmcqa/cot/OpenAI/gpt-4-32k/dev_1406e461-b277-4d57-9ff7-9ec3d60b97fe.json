    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone that is often used during surgery to control bleeding. It does this by causing vasoconstriction, or the narrowing of blood vessels, which reduces blood flow and therefore bleeding. However, this can also have effects on the heart. By causing vasoconstriction, adrenaline increases the resistance that the heart has to pump against, which can increase the heart rate and potentially lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Syncope, or fainting, is usually caused by a drop in blood pressure, which is not a typical effect of adrenaline. In fact, adrenaline usually increases blood pressure due to its vasoconstrictive effects. A drastic fall in blood pressure is therefore also not a typical result of adrenaline use. Finally, while adrenaline can cause an allergic reaction in some people, this is not a common effect and is not directly related to its use in controlling bleeding during surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cardiac arrhythmias\"}"
