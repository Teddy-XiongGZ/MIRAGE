    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tongue thrusting is a condition where the tongue pushes against or between the teeth while a person is at rest, swallowing or speaking. There are different types of tongue thrusting: simple, complex, and retained infantile swallow. Simple tongue thrusting is when the tongue pushes against the teeth during swallowing. Complex tongue thrusting involves not only the tongue pushing against the teeth during swallowing, but also during speech and at rest. Retained infantile swallow is when the swallowing pattern from infancy is retained into childhood or adulthood. The prognosis of tongue thrusting depends on the severity and complexity of the condition. Therefore, complex tongue thrusting, which involves more persistent and pervasive tongue thrusting behaviors, would likely have the worst prognosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
