    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha-thalassemia trait is a form of thalassemia which affects the alpha globin gene. This condition is characterized by a decrease in the production of alpha globin chains. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that separates the different types of hemoglobin based on their electrical charge. In alpha-thalassemia trait, the production of HbF (fetal hemoglobin) and HbA2 (a minor component of adult hemoglobin) is not affected, so their levels should be normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Normal HbF and normal HbA2\"}"
