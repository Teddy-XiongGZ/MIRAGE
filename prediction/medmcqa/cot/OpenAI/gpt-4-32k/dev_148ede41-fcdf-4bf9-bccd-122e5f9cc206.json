    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Impression compound is a material used in dentistry for taking impressions of oral structures. It is a thermoplastic material, which means it softens with heat and hardens upon cooling. Therefore, it does not have a high fusion temperature (D). It does not form cross linkages with heating (C). It does not have a crystalline structure (B). It has low thermal conductivity (A) because it needs to be able to be heated and cooled without causing discomfort to the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
