    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Variance is a measure of how spread out a data set is. It is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. In this case, we are given the standard deviations (SD) for Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Vitamin D, not the variances. However, variance is the square of the standard deviation. So, the variance of DBP is 11^2 = 121 and the variance of Vitamin D is 3^2 = 9. Comparing these two variances, it's clear that the variance of DBP is greater than the variance of Vitamin D, and it's more than 4 times greater.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Variance of DBP > 4 times Vitamin D\" }"
