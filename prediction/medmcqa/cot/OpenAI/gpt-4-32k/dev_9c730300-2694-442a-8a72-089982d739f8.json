    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best way to assess the tissue response to oral hygiene instruction. Probing the base of the socket (A) is not directly related to oral hygiene instruction. Reduced tooth mobility (D) is more related to periodontal disease progression and not directly linked to oral hygiene instruction. Changes in plaque scores (B) and reduced tendency to bleed on probing the gingival margin (C) are both related to oral hygiene instruction. However, changes in plaque scores are more directly related to the mechanical removal of plaque, while reduced tendency to bleed on probing the gingival margin is a sign of improved gingival health, which is the ultimate goal of oral hygiene instruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
