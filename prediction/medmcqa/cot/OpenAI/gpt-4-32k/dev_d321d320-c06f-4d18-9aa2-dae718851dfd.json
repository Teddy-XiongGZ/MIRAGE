    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"NiTi files, or Nickel-Titanium files, are used in endodontics and are often cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). However, prolonged exposure to NaOCl can lead to corrosion of these files. The temperature of 122-degree F is quite high and can accelerate the corrosion process. Therefore, the files should not be submerged for too long. 2 hours and 60 mins seem too long and could potentially damage the files. Between 20 and 45 mins, 20 mins is the safer choice to prevent damage to file corrosion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
