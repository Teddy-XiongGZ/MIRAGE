    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1-3 beta - d - glucan assay is a blood test that is used to detect a wide range of fungal infections. It works by detecting the presence of 1-3 beta - d - glucan, a component of many fungal cell walls. Invasive candidiasis, Cryptococcus, and Penicillium all have 1-3 beta - d - glucan in their cell walls, so the test could potentially be used for any of these infections. However, Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is caused by a type of fungus that does not contain 1-3 beta - d - glucan in its cell wall, so the test would not be useful for this infection. Among the options, invasive candidiasis is the most common infection for which this test is used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Invasive candidiasis\"}"
