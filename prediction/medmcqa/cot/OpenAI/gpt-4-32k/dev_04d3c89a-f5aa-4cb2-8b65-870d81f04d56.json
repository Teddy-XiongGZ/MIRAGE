It is not a disorder of the peripheral nerve, spinal cord, or motor neuron. Instead, it is characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles under your voluntary control. It's caused by a breakdown in the normal communication between nerves and muscles. This breakdown occurs at the neuromuscular junction \u2014 the place where nerve cells connect with the muscles they control.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Neuromuscular junction\"}"
