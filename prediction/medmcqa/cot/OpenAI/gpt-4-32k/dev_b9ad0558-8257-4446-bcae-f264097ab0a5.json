    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's vital signs indicate that he is in shock, with a high respiratory rate and low blood pressure. This could be due to a hemothorax or pneumothorax caused by the rib injuries. While all the options could be part of the management plan, the immediate step would be to stabilize the patient's condition. Intubation might not be necessary at this point as the patient is conscious and able to speak. A chest X-ray would be useful for diagnosis but is not the immediate priority. Needle decompression (option D) could be used to treat a tension pneumothorax, but there's no clear indication of this condition from the information given. Therefore, the most immediate step would be to address the shock, which is most likely due to blood loss, by giving the patient fluids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Urgent fluid infusion\"}"
