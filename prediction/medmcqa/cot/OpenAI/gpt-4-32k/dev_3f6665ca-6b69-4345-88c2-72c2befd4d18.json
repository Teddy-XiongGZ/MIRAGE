    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The nerve marked in the diagram is not specified in the question, so I will assume it is the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). The oculomotor nerve innervates all the extraocular muscles except for the superior oblique and the lateral rectus. The superior oblique is innervated by the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV), and the lateral rectus is innervated by the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI). Therefore, the muscle not supplied by the oculomotor nerve among the options is the superior oblique.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
