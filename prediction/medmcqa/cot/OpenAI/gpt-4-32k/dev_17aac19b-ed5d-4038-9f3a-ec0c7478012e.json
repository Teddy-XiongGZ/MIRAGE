    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ameloblastoma is a benign, slow-growing tumor that originates in the cells that form the enamel that protects your teeth. It does not resemble BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma) or SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) as these are skin cancers. It also does not resemble Osteosarcoma, which is a type of bone cancer. Fibrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that consists of fibroblasts (a type of cell that synthesizes the extracellular matrix and collagen), but it's not the correct answer either because ameloblastoma originates from different cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
