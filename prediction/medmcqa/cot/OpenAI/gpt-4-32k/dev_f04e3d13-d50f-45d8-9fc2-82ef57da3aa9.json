    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Penicillinase is an enzyme that some bacteria produce to inactivate penicillin antibiotics, making them resistant to these drugs. Ampicillin is a type of penicillin, so penicillinase-producing bacteria would be resistant to it. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, not a penicillin, so it would not be affected by penicillinase. Dicloxacillin, however, is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, meaning it can still be effective against bacteria that produce this enzyme.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dicloxacillin\"}"
