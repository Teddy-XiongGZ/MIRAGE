    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cementosis is a dental condition where excess cementum, a calcified substance that covers the root of the tooth, accumulates on the teeth's roots. It is not gender or location specific, meaning it can occur in both males and females and in both the maxilla (upper jaw) and mandible (lower jaw). However, the question seems to be asking for the most common occurrence. In general, dental issues tend to be more common in females due to hormonal changes that can affect oral health. Also, the mandible is more commonly affected in many dental conditions due to its anatomy and function. Therefore, the most likely answer would be females in the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Females in mandible\"}"
