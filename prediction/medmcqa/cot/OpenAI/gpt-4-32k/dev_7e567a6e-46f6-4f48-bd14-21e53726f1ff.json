    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and each has unique properties. Changing one amino acid for another can significantly alter the structure and function of a protein. A. Glutamine and Asparagine are both polar and uncharged, so this change might not significantly alter the protein's function. B. Aspartate and Glutamate are both negatively charged, so this change might not significantly alter the protein's function. C. Alanine and Tryptophan are very different in terms of size and polarity, so this change would likely significantly alter the protein's function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of these\"}"
