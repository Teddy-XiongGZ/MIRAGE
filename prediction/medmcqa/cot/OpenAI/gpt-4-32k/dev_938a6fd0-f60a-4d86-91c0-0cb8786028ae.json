    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Class III composite preparation refers to a dental procedure that involves the removal of caries or old fillings and the preparation of the tooth for a new filling in the anterior teeth. The retention points are areas where the filling material can mechanically lock into the tooth structure for better stability. The dentinoenamel junction is the area where the enamel, the outermost layer of the tooth, meets the dentin, the layer beneath the enamel. This junction provides a good location for retention points because it provides a balance between strength and conservation of tooth structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. At the dentinoenamel junction\"}"
