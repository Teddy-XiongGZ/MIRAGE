    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament is a specialized connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. With aging, the number of cells in the periodontal ligament decreases due to the natural process of cell death and reduced cell proliferation. At the same time, the amount of collagen fibers, which provide structural support, increases. This is because the body tries to compensate for the loss of cells by producing more collagen fibers. Therefore, the aging changes in periodontal ligament are a decrease in the number of cells and an increase in collagen fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
