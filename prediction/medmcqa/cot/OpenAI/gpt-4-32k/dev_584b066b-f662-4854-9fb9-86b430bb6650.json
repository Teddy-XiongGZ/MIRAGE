    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ludwig's angina is a type of severe cellulitis that involves the floor of the mouth, usually occurring bilaterally. It can be life-threatening due to the risk of rapid progression to airway obstruction. The first step in managing Ludwig's angina is to secure the airway, but this is typically done non-surgically if possible. The next step is to start the patient on intravenous antibiotics and fluids to fight the infection and support the patient's overall health. Surgical interventions like incision and drainage or tracheostomy are usually reserved for cases where the patient's airway cannot be secured non-surgically or the infection does not respond to antibiotics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. I/V antibiotics and fluids\"}"
