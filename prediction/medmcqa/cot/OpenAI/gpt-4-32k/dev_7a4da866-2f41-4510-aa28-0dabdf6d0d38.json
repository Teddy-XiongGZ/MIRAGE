    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cholesterol is a type of fat that is present in animal-based foods. Coconut oil, although high in saturated fats, does not contain cholesterol because it is a plant-based product. Hydrogenated fats are typically plant-based oils that have been processed to become solid at room temperature, so they also do not contain cholesterol. Ghee, although it is derived from an animal product (butter), is clarified, meaning the milk solids (which contain the cholesterol) have been removed. Therefore, the food with the highest cholesterol content among these options is egg yolk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
