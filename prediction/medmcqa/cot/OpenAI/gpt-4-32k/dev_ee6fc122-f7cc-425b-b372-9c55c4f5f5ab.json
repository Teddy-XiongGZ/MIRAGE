    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Bishop score is a system used to predict whether induction of labor will be required. It includes five parameters: cervical dilation, cervical effacement, fetal station, cervical consistency, and cervical position. Each parameter is given a score from 0 to 3, except for dilation which is scored from 0 to 5. In this case, the woman has 1 cm dilation (score of 1), 30% effacement (score of 1), -1 station (score of 1), soft cervix (score of 1), and posterior cervix (score of 0). Adding these scores together gives a total Bishop score of 4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 5\"}"
