    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the reason for a perforation on the labial surface of a maxillary incisor during access opening. The labial surface is the front surface of the tooth, facing the lips. The CEJ, or cementoenamel junction, is the location where the enamel, which covers the crown of the tooth, and the cementum, which covers the root of the tooth, meet. If a perforation occurs in this area, it is likely due to an incorrect assessment of the inclination of the crown to the root. Since the perforation is on the labial (or facial) surface, it would be due to an inability to assess the facial inclination of the crown to root, not the lingual inclination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Inability to assess the facial inclination of crown to root\"}"
