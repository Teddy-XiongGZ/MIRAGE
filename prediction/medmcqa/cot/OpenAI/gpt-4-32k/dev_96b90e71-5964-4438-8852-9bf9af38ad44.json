    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a bilateral cleft lip and palate, which is a congenital deformity that affects the upper lip and the roof of the mouth. The maxillary transverse width is normal, which means that the width of the upper jaw is within the normal range. The lateral incisor is missing, which is a common occurrence in patients with cleft lip and palate. The canine is impacted, which means it has not erupted properly. The treatment approach would involve addressing the cleft lip and palate, the missing incisor, and the impacted canine. SABG (Secondary Alveolar Bone Grafting) is a procedure that is often used in patients with cleft lip and palate to provide bone support for the teeth and to close the oronasal fistula. Expansion is not necessary in this case as the maxillary transverse width is normal. Therefore, the treatment approach would involve SABG only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
