    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand the difference between exocrine and endocrine glands. Exocrine glands secrete their products into ducts, while endocrine glands secrete their products (hormones) directly into the bloodstream. Salivary glands secrete saliva into a duct that leads to the mouth, so they are exocrine. Next, we need to understand the difference between merocrine and holocrine secretion. Merocrine secretion involves the release of secretory products by exocytosis, while holocrine secretion involves the rupture and death of the cell to release its contents. Salivary glands secrete saliva by exocytosis, so they are merocrine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
