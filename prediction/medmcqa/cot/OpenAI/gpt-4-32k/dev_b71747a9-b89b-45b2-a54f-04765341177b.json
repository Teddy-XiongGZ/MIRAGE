    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anticholinergic agents are drugs that block the action of acetylcholine. Some of these drugs can cross the blood-brain barrier, which means they can affect the brain and central nervous system. Atropine, Hyoscine butylbromide, and Hyoscine hydrobromide are all anticholinergic agents that can cross the blood-brain barrier. However, Glycopyrrolate is a quaternary ammonium compound, which means it is charged and therefore does not readily cross lipid membranes, including the blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Glycopyrrolate\"}"
