    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-synovial joints are joints that do not have a synovial cavity and are connected via fibrous tissue or cartilage. Syndesmosis is a type of fibrous joint where the bones are joined by a band of connective tissue, making it a non-synovial joint. Synchondrosis is a type of cartilaginous joint, also a non-synovial joint, but it is connected by hyaline cartilage, not connective tissue. Saddle is a type of synovial joint, so it's not the correct answer. Suture is a type of fibrous joint found only in the skull, and it is also a non-synovial joint, but it is not characterized by connective tissue in between.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Syndesmosis\"}"
