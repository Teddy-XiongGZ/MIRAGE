    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand how these antibiotics work. Penicillin works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, which is most effective when the bacteria are growing. Erythromycin, on the other hand, works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria. There is no evidence to suggest that penicillin is inactivated by erythromycin (option A) or that erythromycin enhances the \u03b2-lactamases activity (option C). Erythromycin does exert its effects extracellularly (option B), but this does not provide a reason why it would be inappropriate to use both antibiotics at the same time. The key here is that penicillin is only effective against growing cells (option D). If erythromycin is used at the same time, it could inhibit bacterial growth, making penicillin less effective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
