    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Beta 3 glucan assay is a blood test that is used to detect a wide range of fungal infections. It works by detecting beta-D-glucan, a sugar that is found in the cell walls of many fungi. Invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis are fungal infections, so the test can be used for these. Pneumocystis carnii is also a type of fungus, so the test can be used for this as well. However, Mucormycosis is caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. These molds do not contain beta-D-glucan in their cell walls, so the test cannot be used for this infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Mucormycosis\"}"
