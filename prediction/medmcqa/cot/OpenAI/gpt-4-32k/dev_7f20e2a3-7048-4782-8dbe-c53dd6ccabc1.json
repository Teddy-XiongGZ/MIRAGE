    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most effective method to reduce patient somatic exposure during a radiograph. A lead apron (A) is used to protect certain parts of the body from radiation, but it doesn't reduce the overall exposure. Added filtration (C) can reduce patient exposure, but it's not the most effective method. An open ended, shielded cone (D) can also reduce exposure, but it's not the most effective. Speed E film (B), however, is designed to require less radiation exposure to create an image, thus reducing the patient's overall exposure to radiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
