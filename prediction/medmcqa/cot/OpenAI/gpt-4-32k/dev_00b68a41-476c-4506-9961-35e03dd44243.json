    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogenesis is the process of glycogen synthesis, in which glucose molecules are added to chains of glycogen for storage. Glycogen synthase is the key enzyme in this process. Glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down the glycogen polymer into glucose units. The key enzyme in this process is glycogen phosphorylase. Glucan transferase is involved in the rearrangement of the glycogen structure, and phosphoglucomutase is involved in the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate in both processes. However, the question asks for the enzyme that is common in both processes, which is phosphoglucomutase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phosphoglucomutase\"}"
