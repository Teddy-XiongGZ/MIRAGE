    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A lingual bar is a type of major connector used in removable partial dentures. It is used when the lingual sulcus, the space between the tongue and the teeth, is deep enough to accommodate it without causing discomfort or impeding tongue movement. If the lingual sulcus is shallow, a lingual bar would not be suitable as it may cause discomfort and interfere with normal tongue function. Therefore, the lingual bar is not used when splinting of adjacent teeth is required or when abutment teeth have poor bony support.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
