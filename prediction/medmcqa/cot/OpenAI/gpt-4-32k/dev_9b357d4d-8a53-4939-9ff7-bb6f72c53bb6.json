    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand the normal values: pCO2 (35-45 mmHg), pO2 (75-100 mmHg), and pH (7.35-7.45). In this case, pCO2 is low (30), which indicates a respiratory condition. The pH is at the higher end of normal (7.45), indicating alkalosis. Since the pCO2 is low (which would usually cause alkalosis) and the body's pH is also high, this indicates that the body has compensated for the condition. Therefore, the patient has compensated respiratory alkalosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Respiratory alkalosis\"}"
