    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is a polar molecule, so it cannot pass through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane by simple diffusion. It needs a transport mechanism. Primary active transport uses ATP directly, but glucose transport does not use ATP directly. Counter transport is a type of active transport that involves the simultaneous or sequential transport of two substances in opposite directions across a membrane. This is not the case for glucose. Secondary active transport, also known as co-transport, uses the energy from an ion concentration gradient, or electrical gradient, to transport another substance. In the case of glucose in the intestine, it is transported into cells against a concentration gradient with the help of sodium ions (Na+). This is a form of secondary active transport known as sodium-glucose co-transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
