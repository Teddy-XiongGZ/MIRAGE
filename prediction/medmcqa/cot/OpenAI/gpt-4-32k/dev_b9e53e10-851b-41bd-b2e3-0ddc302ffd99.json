    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stridor is a high-pitched, wheezing sound caused by disrupted airflow. Stridor may also be called musical breathing or extrathoracic airway obstruction. Airflow is usually disrupted by a blockage in the larynx (voice box) or trachea (windpipe). In this case, the patient has carcinoma of the larynx, which is causing the stridor. This is a medical emergency as it can lead to complete airway obstruction. Therefore, immediate intervention is necessary to secure the airway and ensure the patient can breathe. Waiting for 12 hours or giving high dose steroids will not immediately solve the problem. A planned tracheostomy would also take too long. Therefore, an immediate tracheostomy is the best option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Immediate tracheostomy\"}"
