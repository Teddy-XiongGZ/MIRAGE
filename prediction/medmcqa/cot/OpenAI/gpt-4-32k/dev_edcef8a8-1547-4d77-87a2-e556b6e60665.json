    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Medial squint, also known as esotropia, is a condition where the eye turns inward towards the nose. This is caused by an imbalance in the muscles that move the eye. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) innervates the majority of the eye muscles, including the medial rectus muscle, which is responsible for moving the eye inward. If the oculomotor nerve is paralyzed, the medial rectus muscle cannot function properly, leading to medial squint. The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which moves the eye outward, so paralysis of this nerve would cause lateral squint, not medial squint. The optic nerve (cranial nerve II) is responsible for vision, not eye movement. The trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) innervates the superior oblique muscle, which moves the eye downward and outward, so paralysis of this nerve would not cause medial squint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Occulomotor nerve\"}"
