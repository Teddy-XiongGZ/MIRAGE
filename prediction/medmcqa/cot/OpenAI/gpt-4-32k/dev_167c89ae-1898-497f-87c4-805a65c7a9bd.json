    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Supporting cusps are the cusps of the teeth that make contact with the opposing teeth during occlusion. The central fossa is the part of the tooth where the cusps of the opposing tooth fit into during occlusion. Marginal ridges are the rounded borders of the enamel that form the mesial and distal margins of the occlusal surface of premolars and molars, and they do not directly participate in occlusion. Embrasures are the V-shaped spaces between the proximal surfaces of two adjoining teeth, and they also do not participate in occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
