    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand what H1N1 Influenza is. It's a subtype of Influenza A virus, commonly known as swine flu. Now, let's analyze each option. Option A suggests that pregnant women with a sore throat can be started immediately on oseltamivir without diagnostic testing under category B. This is true as pregnant women are at high risk for severe complications from influenza, and early treatment with antiviral drugs like oseltamivir is recommended. Option B states that people on long-term steroids cannot receive oseltamivir. This is not true as there are no contraindications for oseltamivir use in these patients. Option C and D are incorrect as they refer to a 'Category B' which is not a recognized classification in the management of H1N1 Influenza.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
