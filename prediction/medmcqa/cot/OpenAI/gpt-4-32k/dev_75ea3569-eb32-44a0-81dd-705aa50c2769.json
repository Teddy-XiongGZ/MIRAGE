    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The diameter of a nerve fiber or axon affects the speed at which an electrical impulse, or action potential, is conducted along the nerve fiber. This is because larger diameter fibers have less resistance to the flow of ions that carry the electrical charge. The refractory period, latency period, and amplitude are not directly affected by the diameter of the nerve fiber or axon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
