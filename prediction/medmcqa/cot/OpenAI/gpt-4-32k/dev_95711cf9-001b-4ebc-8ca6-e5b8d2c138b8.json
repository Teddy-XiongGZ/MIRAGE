    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. It is supplied by several arteries. The middle meningeal artery (A), a branch of the maxillary artery, is the largest of these and supplies most of the dura mater. The accessory meningeal artery (D), a branch of the maxillary artery, also supplies the dura mater. The meningeal branch of the internal carotid artery (B) supplies the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries (C), branches of the ophthalmic artery, supply the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses, but not the dura mater.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
