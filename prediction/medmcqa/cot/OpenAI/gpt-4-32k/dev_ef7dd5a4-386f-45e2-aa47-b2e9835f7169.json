    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autogenic inhibition is a process that involves the Golgi tendon organ. This organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor organ that senses changes in muscle tension. It lies at the origin and insertion of skeletal muscle fibers into the tendons of skeletal muscle. When there is a high tension in the muscle, the Golgi tendon organ is activated, which then inhibits the muscle from contracting and causing damage. This process is known as autogenic inhibition. Therefore, it is not related to intrafusal fibers, extrafusal fibers, or muscle spindles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Golgi tendon organ\"}"
