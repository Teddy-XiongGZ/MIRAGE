    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High copper amalgam alloy is a type of dental filling material. It is known for its high strength and durability, which contradicts option A. High copper amalgam alloy also has a low marginal breakdown, which contradicts option B. The term 'less marginal #' is not clear, but if it refers to less marginal leakage, then it could be a characteristic of high copper amalgam alloy. High creep refers to the slow deformation of a material under stress over time. High copper amalgam alloys are known for their low creep, not high, which contradicts option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
