    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Class I cavity preparation for both amalgam and gold inlay requires certain common features. The walls of the cavity should be divergent to allow for proper placement and retention of the restorative material. However, this divergence is buccolingual, not mesiodistal. The depth of the cavity is also important, but it's not always necessary to have maximum depth in both cases. The depth should be sufficient to provide enough thickness for the restorative material, but not so deep that it risks pulp exposure or weakens the tooth structure. Therefore, the common feature is buccolingually divergent walls.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
