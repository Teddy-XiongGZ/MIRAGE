    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with severe symptoms of an asthma attack, including severe breathlessness, diaphoresis, and wheezing. Her vital signs indicate tachypnea (increased respiratory rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and tachycardia (increased heart rate). The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low pH indicating acidosis, low pO2 indicating hypoxia, and high pCO2 indicating hypercapnia. These findings suggest that the patient is in respiratory failure. In such a case, the patient would require immediate intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Among the options, mechanical ventilation with controlled ventilation (option C) would be the most appropriate choice. This would allow for the control of the patient's breathing, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and relieving the patient's respiratory muscles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
