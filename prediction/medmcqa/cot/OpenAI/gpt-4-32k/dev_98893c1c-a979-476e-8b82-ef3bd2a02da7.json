    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Weber-Fechner's law is a principle in psychophysics, which states that the perceived intensity of a stimulus is proportional to its actual intensity, expressed on a logarithmic scale. This means that the perceived strength of a stimulus is not directly proportional to the number of neurons or receptors stimulated, nor the amplitude of the action potential. Instead, it is directly proportional to the logarithm of the actual intensity of the stimulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
