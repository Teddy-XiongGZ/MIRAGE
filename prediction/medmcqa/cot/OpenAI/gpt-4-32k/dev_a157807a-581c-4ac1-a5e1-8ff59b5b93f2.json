    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Centric interference refers to the disruption of normal occlusion or bite alignment due to the improper contact of teeth. The main goal in removing centric interference is to ensure that the upper and lower teeth meet properly without any hindrance. This is usually achieved by reducing the supporting cusps, which are the parts of the teeth that make contact during biting or chewing. The central fossa is the deepest part of the occlusal surface of the tooth, and reducing it would not necessarily remove centric interference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Supporting cusps\"}"
