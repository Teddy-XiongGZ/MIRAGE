    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aortoiliac occlusive disease is a condition where the aorta and iliac arteries become blocked or narrowed. This can lead to a variety of symptoms depending on the severity and location of the blockage. Calf claudication is more associated with peripheral artery disease affecting the lower extremities. Impotence can be a symptom but it's not the most common. Being symptomless is not the most common either, as the disease usually presents with symptoms. Gluteal claudication, which is discomfort or pain in the buttocks while walking, is the most common symptom of aortoiliac occlusive disease because the blockage or narrowing of the arteries affects the blood flow to the lower body, including the buttocks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Gluteal claudication\"}"
