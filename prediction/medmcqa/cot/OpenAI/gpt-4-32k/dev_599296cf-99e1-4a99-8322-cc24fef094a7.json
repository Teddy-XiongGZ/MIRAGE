    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Rh-negative mother was given Anti-D during her 28 weeks of pregnancy. This is done to prevent Rh isoimmunization, a condition where the mother's body produces antibodies against the Rh-positive blood of the baby, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn. The Anti-D immunoglobulin prevents the mother's immune system from recognizing the Rh-positive cells, thus preventing the production of antibodies. However, after the birth, if the baby is Rh-positive, there is a risk that the mother's body may be exposed to the baby's Rh-positive blood during the delivery process. Therefore, another dose of Anti-D is usually given within 72 hours after birth to prevent isoimmunization in future pregnancies. This is done irrespective of the baby's blood group because the risk of isoimmunization exists even if the baby is Rh-negative, as there may be a small amount of Rh-positive blood in the baby's system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
