    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Liver failure in a child is a serious condition. Transaminases are enzymes that are released when the liver is damaged, but their levels do not necessarily correlate with the severity of liver failure. Bilirubin is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells and is processed by the liver, so increasing levels can indicate liver dysfunction, but again, it does not necessarily correlate with the severity of liver failure. Prothrombin time is a measure of how long it takes for the blood to clot, and the liver produces factors necessary for clotting, so an increasing prothrombin time can indicate severe liver failure. However, Gram-negative sepsis is a severe infection that can lead to organ failure and death, and in a child with liver failure, the immune system is already compromised, making the child more susceptible to severe infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Gram (\u2013)ve sepsis\"}"
