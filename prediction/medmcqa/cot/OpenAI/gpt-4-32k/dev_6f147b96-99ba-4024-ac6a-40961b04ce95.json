    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity refers to the measure of a material's ability to deform under stress without permanent deformation. The lower the modulus of elasticity, the more flexible the material is. Among the given options, NiTi, Beta titanium, Stainless steel, and Co-Cr-Ni, NiTi (Nickel Titanium) is known to have the lowest modulus of elasticity, making it the most flexible and therefore used in orthodontics for its superelastic properties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
