    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrous oxide (NO) analgesia, also known as laughing gas, is often used for pain relief in medical procedures. However, it can displace oxygen in the lungs, leading to hypoxia if not properly managed. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure a minimum concentration of oxygen when using NO analgesia. The standard practice is to maintain at least 30% oxygen concentration to prevent hypoxia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 30%\"}"
