    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Swine flu, also known as H1N1 virus, was a new flu virus strain that emerged in 2009 causing illness in people. This virus was originally referred to as 'swine flu' because laboratory testing showed that its gene segments were similar to influenza viruses that were most recently identified in and caused illness in pigs. However, further study has shown that the virus is very different from the typical swine flu viruses found in pigs. It spread globally and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic in June 2009. However, as of now, it is not considered a pandemic because it is not causing a global outbreak. It is also not an endemic because it is not constantly present in a specific location. It is not a seasonal variation either because it does not occur in a specific season. Therefore, it is considered an epidemic because it can cause a sudden increase in the number of cases of the disease in a community or region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Epidemic\"}"
