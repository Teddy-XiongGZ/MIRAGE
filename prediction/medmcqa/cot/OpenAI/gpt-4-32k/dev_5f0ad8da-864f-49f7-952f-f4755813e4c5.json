    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that lowers blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing calcium excretion by the kidneys. TNF alpha is a proinflammatory cytokine and does not directly influence calcium levels. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, not calcium. Parathormone, or parathyroid hormone, is produced by the parathyroid glands and increases blood calcium levels by stimulating osteoclast activity, increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, and decreasing calcium excretion by the kidneys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
