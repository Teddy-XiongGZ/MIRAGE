    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation sensitivity varies among different tissues in the body. Hematopoietic tissue, which is responsible for producing blood cells, is highly sensitive to radiation. Bone, while not as sensitive as hematopoietic tissue, is still more sensitive than some other tissues. Muscle tissue is moderately sensitive to radiation. Nerve tissue, however, is known to be one of the least sensitive tissues to radiation exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Nerve\"}"
