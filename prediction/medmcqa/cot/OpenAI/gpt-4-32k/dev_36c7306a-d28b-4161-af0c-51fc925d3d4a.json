    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tooth eruption is the process by which a tooth moves from its site of development within the jaws to its final functional position in the oral cavity. This process is not due to osteoclastic activity, which is the resorption or breakdown of bone tissue. It is also not due to the proliferation of cells at the crypt, which is related to the formation of the tooth bud. Exfoliation of the primary tooth is a process that happens after the tooth has already erupted and is ready to be replaced by a permanent tooth. Therefore, the process of tooth eruption is due to eruptive forces, which are generated by the dental follicle and periodontal ligament, pushing the tooth out.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
