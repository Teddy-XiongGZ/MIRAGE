    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optic chiasm is the part of the brain where the optic nerves partially cross. The fibers from the nasal half of each retina cross over to the other side at the optic chiasm. If the optic chiasm is interrupted, it would affect the fibers that have crossed over, which carry information from the temporal (outer) half of each visual field. Therefore, the loss of vision would be in the outer (temporal) half of each visual field, which is known as bitemporal hemianopia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
