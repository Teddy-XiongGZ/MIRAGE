    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Digoxin is a medication used to treat various heart conditions. The fact that it is obtained from a plant product doesn't directly influence the treatment formulation. The half-life of a drug is the time it takes for the concentration of the drug in the body to reduce by half. A drug with a long half-life, like digoxin, doesn't need to be administered as frequently as a drug with a short half-life. This doesn't necessarily mean it requires a high loading dose. Intravenous administration in emergency and urgent dosing is not directly related to the half-life of the drug. The half-life of digoxin does help in adjusting the maintenance dose to keep the blood levels within the therapeutic range, but it also allows for alternate day dosing due to its long half-life.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Long half-life permits altemate day dosing\"}"
