    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The AJCC 8th edition staging system for oral cavity cancer is based on the size of the primary tumor (T), the involvement of nearby lymph nodes (N), and the presence of distant metastasis (M). In this case, the patient has a 2.5*3.5 cm lesion on the tongue with no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. According to the AJCC guidelines, T2 refers to a tumor that is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension. N0 means there is no regional lymph node metastasis. M0 means there is no distant metastasis. Therefore, the patient's cancer would be staged as T2N0M0.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
