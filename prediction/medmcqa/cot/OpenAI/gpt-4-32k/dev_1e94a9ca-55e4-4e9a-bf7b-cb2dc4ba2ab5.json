    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SD plasma is treated with solvent detergent which inactivates lipid enveloped viruses. HIV, HBV, and HCV are all lipid enveloped viruses, so they would be destroyed by SD plasma. However, HAV is a non-enveloped virus, meaning it does not have a lipid envelope that can be destroyed by the solvent detergent process. Therefore, HAV is the most likely infection possibility after SD plasma transfusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
