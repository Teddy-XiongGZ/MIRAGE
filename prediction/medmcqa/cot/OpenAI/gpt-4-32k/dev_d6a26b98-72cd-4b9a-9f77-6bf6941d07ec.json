    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Beta 1,3 Glucan is a component of the cell wall of many fungi. It is used as a diagnostic test for invasive fungal infections. Aspergillus and Candida are fungi that contain Beta 1,3 Glucan in their cell walls, so the test would be positive for these. Pneumocystis Jirovecii is also a fungus, but it does not contain Beta 1,3 Glucan in its cell wall, so the test would be negative. Mucormycosis is caused by the Mucorales order of fungi, which do not contain Beta 1,3 Glucan in their cell walls, so the test would be negative.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Mucormycosis\"}"
