    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In cases of hypothermia, it is important to measure the core body temperature, which is the temperature of the internal organs. The oral and armpit methods are not as accurate in these cases because they measure the temperature of the skin, not the internal organs. The tympanic membrane method measures the temperature of the blood vessels in the ear, which can be influenced by external factors such as cold air. The rectal method is the most accurate because it measures the temperature of the internal organs directly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Rectal\"}"
