    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The apical foramen is the opening at the apex of the root of a tooth. Its size can vary among individuals and can also change with age. However, the average diameter of the apical foramen in adults is generally reported to be around 200-500 micrometers. Considering the age group mentioned in the question is above 55 years, the diameter might be slightly larger due to age-related changes, but it is unlikely to exceed the upper limit of the average range significantly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 502 micrometer\"}"
