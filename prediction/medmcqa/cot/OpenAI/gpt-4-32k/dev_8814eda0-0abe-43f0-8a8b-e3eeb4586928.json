    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anterior pituitary hormones are regulated by the hypothalamus. TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is stimulated by the hypothalamus, not inhibited. GRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) is also stimulated by the hypothalamus. Somatostatin is actually a hormone produced by the hypothalamus that inhibits the release of growth hormone and TSH from the anterior pituitary, so it's not an anterior pituitary hormone. Prolactin, on the other hand, is primarily under inhibitory control from the hypothalamus via dopamine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Prolactin\"}"
