    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the heat required to change boiling water into vapor. This process is known as vaporization. The heat required for this process is referred to as the Latent Heat of Vaporization. Therefore, the answer is not the Latent Heat of Sublimation, which is the heat required to change a solid directly into a gas, nor the Latent Heat of Condensation, which is the heat released when a gas turns into a liquid, and not the Latent Heat of Fusion, which is the heat required to change a solid into a liquid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
