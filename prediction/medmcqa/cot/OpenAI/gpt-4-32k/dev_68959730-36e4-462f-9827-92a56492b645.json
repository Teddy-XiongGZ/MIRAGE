    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bacteria in the mouth tend to accumulate in areas that are difficult to clean or that are not cleaned frequently. The buccal surface is the side of the tooth that faces the cheeks or lips and is relatively easy to clean. The lingual surface is the side of the tooth that faces the tongue, which is also relatively easy to clean. The occlusal surface is the chewing surface of the tooth, which is cleaned every time we eat or drink. The interproximal surface, however, is the area between two adjacent teeth. This area is difficult to clean and is often overlooked during brushing, making it a common place for bacteria to accumulate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Interproximal surface\"}"
