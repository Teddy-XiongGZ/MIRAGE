    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Good clinical practice is a set of internationally recognized ethical and scientific quality requirements that must be observed for designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. It is observed in all phases of clinical trials, which include Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and Phase IV. However, the preclinical phase does not involve human subjects, it involves in vitro (test tube or cell culture) and in vivo (animal) experiments. Therefore, good clinical practice does not apply to the preclinical phase. Also, there is no Phase V in clinical trials.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Preclinical\"}"
