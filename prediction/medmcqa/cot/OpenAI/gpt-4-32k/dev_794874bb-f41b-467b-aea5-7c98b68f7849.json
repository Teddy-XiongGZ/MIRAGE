    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a hinge joint that connects your jaw to the temporal bones of your skull. The sensory nerve supply to the capsule of the TMJ is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular nerve, itself a division of the trigeminal nerve. The facial nerve is mainly responsible for motor innervation of the muscles of facial expression, not sensory innervation of the TMJ. The masseteric nerve is a motor nerve supplying the masseter muscle, not a sensory nerve for the TMJ. The auricular nerve refers to several nerves, none of which supply the TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Auriculotemporal nerve\"}"
