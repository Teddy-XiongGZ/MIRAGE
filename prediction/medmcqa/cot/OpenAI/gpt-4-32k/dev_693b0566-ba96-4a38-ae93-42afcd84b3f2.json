    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The facial nerve is a crucial structure in the face. It is responsible for motor innervation of the muscles of facial expression. The Superficial Musculo-Aponeurotic System (SMAS) is a layer of tissue that covers, surrounds, and attaches to the deeper tissues and structures of the face and neck, including the muscles of facial expression. The parotidomasseteric fascia is a layer of connective tissue that covers the parotid gland and masseter muscle. The facial nerve lies deep to the SMAS, meaning it is below the SMAS. It also lies superficial to the parotidomasseteric fascia, meaning it is above the parotidomasseteric fascia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
