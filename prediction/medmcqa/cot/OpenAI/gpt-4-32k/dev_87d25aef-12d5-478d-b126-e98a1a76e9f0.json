    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Plasmodium vivax is a parasite that causes malaria. The life cycle of Plasmodium vivax involves several stages. The sporozoite stage is the infective stage for humans, not mosquitoes. The merozoite stage is also a stage in the human host. The zygote stage is a part of the mosquito's gut life cycle, but it is not the infective stage. The gametocyte stage is the one that is infective to mosquitoes. When a mosquito bites an infected human, it ingests the gametocytes, which then continue their life cycle in the mosquito.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
