    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Difficulty in swallowing after receiving a pair of complete dentures could be due to a few reasons. Candida albicans colonizing the mouth causing patient discomfort (option D) could cause difficulty in swallowing, but this is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as a burning sensation in the mouth or a white coating on the tongue, which is not mentioned in the question. Alveolar ridge with bony spicules (option C) could cause discomfort, but it's not directly related to swallowing. Interocclusal distance of more than normal (option B) could cause difficulty in swallowing, but it's less likely than excessive vertical dimension of occlusion with resulting decrease in interocclusal distance (option A). This is because when the vertical dimension of occlusion is excessive, it can interfere with the normal functioning of the muscles and structures involved in swallowing, leading to difficulty in swallowing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
