    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osteoblasts are indeed derived from osteoprogenitor cells, so option A is true. They are regulated by Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), so option B is also true. Osteoblasts have a plasma membrane that shows multiple folds, which increases the surface area for mineral deposition, so option C is true. However, osteoblasts do not have neuropeptide receptors, so option D is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
