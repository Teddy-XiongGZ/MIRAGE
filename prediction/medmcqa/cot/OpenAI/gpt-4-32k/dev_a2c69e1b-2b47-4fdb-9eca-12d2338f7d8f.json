    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A G.V. Black class V lesion is a type of dental cavity that occurs on the gingival third of the facial or lingual surfaces of the tooth. This type of lesion is often associated with erosion and abrasion. The most stable restoration for this type of lesion would be one that provides good adhesion, resistance to wear, and fluoride release to help prevent further decay. Acid etch composite (A) provides good adhesion and resistance to wear, but does not release fluoride. GIC (B) and resin modified GIC (C) both provide good adhesion, resistance to wear, and fluoride release. However, resin modified GIC is generally considered to be more stable and durable than traditional GIC because it has improved physical properties due to the addition of resin. Compomer (D) also provides good adhesion and resistance to wear, but its fluoride release is less than that of GIC and resin modified GIC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
