    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Liley curve is used to assess the severity of fetal anemia in Rh isoimmunization. It is divided into three zones: Zone 1 (low risk), Zone 2 (moderate risk), and Zone 3 (high risk). A Delta OD 450 of 0.20 at 28 weeks gestation is in the top of the third zone, indicating severe fetal anemia. Immediate delivery at 28 weeks gestation would be premature and could lead to complications for the baby. Plasmapheresis is not a treatment for fetal anemia. Repeating the amniocentesis after 1 week would not address the immediate risk to the fetus. The most appropriate management in this case would be intrauterine transfusion, which can correct the anemia and allow the pregnancy to continue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Intrauterine transfusion\"}"
