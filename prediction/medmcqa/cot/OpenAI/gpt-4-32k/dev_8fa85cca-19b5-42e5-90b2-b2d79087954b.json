    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myofunctional appliances are used in orthodontics to correct malocclusions and guide the growth of the jaws. They are typically used during the mixed dentition stage, when the child has both primary (baby) and permanent (adult) teeth. This is because this stage is a transitional period where the jaw is still growing and can be easily guided into the correct position. Using these appliances at the primary dentition stage may be too early as the jaw is still developing, while using them at the permanent dentition stage or in adulthood may be too late as the jaw has mostly finished growing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mixed dentition\"}"
