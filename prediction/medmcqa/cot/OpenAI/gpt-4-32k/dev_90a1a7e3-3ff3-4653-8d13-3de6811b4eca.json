    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The drug increases the heart rate, which suggests it has a beta-1 agonist effect. The drug also increases systolic blood pressure, which suggests it has an alpha-1 agonist effect. The decrease in diastolic blood pressure could be due to the beta-2 agonist effect, which causes vasodilation. The presence of tremors also suggests a beta-2 agonist effect. Therefore, the drug is likely to be an alpha-1 and beta-1 agonist, and a beta-2 agonist.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Alpha-1 and beta-1 agonist\"}"
