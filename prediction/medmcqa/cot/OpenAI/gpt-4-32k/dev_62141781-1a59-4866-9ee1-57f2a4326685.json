    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Orthodontic wires are made of stainless steel, which is an alloy of iron, carbon, and other elements. The iron carbide in stainless steel is in the form of martensite, which is a hard and brittle crystalline structure. Ferrite is a soft and ductile form of iron, while carbide is a compound of carbon and a less electronegative element. Austenite is a solid solution of carbon in gamma-iron, which is not present in stainless steel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Martensite\"}"
