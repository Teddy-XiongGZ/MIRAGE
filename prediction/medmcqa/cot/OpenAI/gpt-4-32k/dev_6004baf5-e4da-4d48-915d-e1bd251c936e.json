    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A retractor is a surgical instrument used to separate the edges of a surgical incision or wound, or to hold back underlying organs and tissues, so that body parts under the incision may be accessed. The LSCS (Lower Segment Cesarean Section) is a type of abdominal surgery, and retractors are commonly used in this type of surgery to provide a clear view and access to the uterus. Vaginal hysterectomy, Fothergill repair, and Manchester operation are all gynecological procedures that are performed through the vagina, and while retractors can be used, they are not as commonly used as in abdominal surgeries like LSCS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
