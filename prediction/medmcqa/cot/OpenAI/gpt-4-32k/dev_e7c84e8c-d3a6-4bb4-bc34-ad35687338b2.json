    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyperglycemia is a condition characterized by an excessive amount of glucose in the bloodstream. It is most often associated with diabetes. Let's analyze the options: \u03b2-blockers can cause hyperglycemia, but it's not their primary effect. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter, it doesn't directly affect blood glucose levels. \u03b1-blockers are used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia, they don't directly cause hyperglycemia. Glucocorticoids, on the other hand, are known to increase blood glucose levels as one of their side effects. They stimulate gluconeogenesis, which increases the production of glucose in the liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
