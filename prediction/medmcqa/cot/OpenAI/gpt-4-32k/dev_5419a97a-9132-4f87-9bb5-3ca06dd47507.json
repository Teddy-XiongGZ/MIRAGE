    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that is released from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft. The release of ACh is dependent on the influx of calcium ions into the presynaptic neuron. Therefore, blocking calcium channels would decrease, not increase, ACh release. Chloride channels are typically involved in inhibitory responses, so blocking them would not directly increase ACh release. Sodium channels are involved in the generation of action potentials, but blocking them would prevent action potentials and thus decrease ACh release. Potassium channels are involved in repolarizing the neuron after an action potential. Blocking these channels would prolong the depolarization phase of the action potential, potentially leading to an increase in ACh release.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Blocking K channels\"}"
