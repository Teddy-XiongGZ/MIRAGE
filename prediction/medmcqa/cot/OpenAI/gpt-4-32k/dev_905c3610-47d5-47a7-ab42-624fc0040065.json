    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart, usually the valves, caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and settling in the heart. Pseudomonas is a type of bacteria that is often associated with infections in people with weakened immune systems or those who are in hospital settings. Intravenous drug abuse is a common risk factor for infective endocarditis because it can introduce bacteria directly into the bloodstream. Pentazocin is a drug that is often abused intravenously. HIV patients, chronic steroid therapy, and elderly with community acquired pneumonia are also at risk for infections, but they are not specifically associated with pseudomonas infective endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
