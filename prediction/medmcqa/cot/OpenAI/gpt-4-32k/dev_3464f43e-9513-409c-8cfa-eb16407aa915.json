    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Shoulder dystocia is a serious condition that occurs when the baby's shoulder gets stuck behind the mother's pelvic bone during delivery. The management of shoulder dystocia involves several maneuvers to help deliver the baby safely. Mc Roberts manoeuvre involves hyperflexing the mother's legs tightly to her abdomen to straighten the pelvis and allow the baby to descend. Suprapubic pressure is applied to the mother's lower abdomen to help rotate the baby's shoulder in the birth canal. Woods manoeuvre, also known as the 'corkscrew', involves rotating the baby's shoulder to help it pass through the birth canal. However, fundal pressure, which involves pushing on the top of the uterus, is not recommended in the management of shoulder dystocia as it can cause complications such as uterine rupture and fetal injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
