    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fick's law is a principle in physics that describes how diffusion occurs. It states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is proportional to the concentration gradient, the surface area over which diffusion is taking place, and inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane. This law is applicable to passive diffusion, where molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration without the use of energy. Active diffusion, on the other hand, involves the use of energy to move molecules against the concentration gradient, which is not covered by Fick's law.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
