    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An ICD tube, or intercostal drainage tube, is used to drain fluid, blood, or air from the pleural space to help restore normal lung function. The functioning of an ICD tube can be checked by observing the movement of the air-water column in the tube during respiration. Continuous air bubbles coming out of the underwater drain may indicate a persistent air leak, which is not necessarily a sign of proper functioning. Repeated chest X-rays are not necessary to check the functioning of the tube and may expose the patient to unnecessary radiation. Auscultation is used to listen to the sounds of the body, not to check the functioning of an ICD tube.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
