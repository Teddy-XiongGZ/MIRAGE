    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Telecanthus is a condition where the distance between the inner corners of the eyes is increased. It can be caused by trauma, and the treatment involves surgical correction. The incision used for this procedure should allow access to the medial canthal tendon, which is the structure that needs to be repaired in this condition. A bicoronal incision is used for procedures on the skull and is too high for this procedure. An upper blepharoplasty incision is used for cosmetic eyelid surgery and does not provide adequate access to the medial canthal tendon. A preauricular incision is used for procedures on the ear and is too lateral for this procedure. An infraorbital incision, however, is made below the eye and provides good access to the medial canthal tendon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Infraorbital incision\"}"
