    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Km value is a term used in enzyme kinetics. It represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of its maximum value (Vmax). It is not related to the purity of the enzyme or its physiological role. While it does provide some information about the enzyme's affinity for its substrate, it is not a direct measure of affinity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
