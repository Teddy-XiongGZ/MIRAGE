    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Child Pugh score is a system used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver disease, primarily cirrhosis. It categorizes patients into three groups based on their score, which is a sum of several clinical measures. This is not a nominal scale because it does not simply categorize patients into distinct groups without any order. It is also not a continuous or quantitative scale because the scores are not continuous values but rather distinct categories. The Child Pugh score is an ordinal scale because it categorizes patients into ordered categories based on their score.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
