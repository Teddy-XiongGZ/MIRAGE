Furosemide, a diuretic, can also help with this. Hemodialysis is typically reserved for life-threatening cases or when other treatments are not effective. Bisphosphonates are used to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy, but they are not typically the first line of treatment. Chemotherapy would address the underlying cancer, but it would not directly address the immediate problem of hypercalcemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. IV fluids and furosemide\"}"
