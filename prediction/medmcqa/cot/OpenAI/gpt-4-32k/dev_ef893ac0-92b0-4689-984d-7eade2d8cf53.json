    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Porcelain fused to metal restorations are commonly used in dentistry. Repeated fracture of such a restoration could be due to several reasons. Occlusal trauma (option A) could cause fractures, but it would typically result in damage to the tooth itself, not just the restoration. An improper firing schedule (option C) could cause problems with the porcelain's strength, but it would likely result in a failure of the entire restoration, not repeated fractures. Failure to use a metal conditioner (option D) could cause bonding issues between the porcelain and the metal, but again, this would likely result in a complete failure of the restoration. An inadequately designed framework (option B), however, could cause repeated fractures. If the framework is not designed properly, it may not be able to support the porcelain, leading to repeated fractures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
