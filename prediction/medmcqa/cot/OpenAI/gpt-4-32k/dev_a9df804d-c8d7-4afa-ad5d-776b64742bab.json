    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A fracture involving the apical one third of the root is a serious injury that can affect the vitality of the tooth. However, if the tooth is treated properly, it can remain vital and functional. Internal root resorption (A) is a rare condition that usually occurs after a traumatic injury or as a result of pulp inflammation, but it's not the most likely outcome. Ankylosis (C) is a condition where the tooth becomes fused with the bone, which is also not the most likely outcome. External root resorption and exfoliation (D) is a process where the root of the tooth is gradually destroyed and the tooth eventually falls out, which is also not the most likely outcome after treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
