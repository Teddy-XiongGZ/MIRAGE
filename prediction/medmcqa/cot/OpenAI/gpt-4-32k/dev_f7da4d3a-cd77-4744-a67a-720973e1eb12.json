    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing tool. The gRNA or guide RNA does indeed ensure that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome, so option A is true. The NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining) repair and HDR (Homology Directed Repair) pathway are mechanisms by which the cell repairs the DNA after it has been cut by the Cas9 enzyme, so option B is also true. However, option C is incorrect. The enzyme used in CRISPR gene editing is called Cas9, not C9.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
