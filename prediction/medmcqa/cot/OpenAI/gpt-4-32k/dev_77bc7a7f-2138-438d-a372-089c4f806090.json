    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microvilli are tiny projections that increase the surface area of cells and are involved in a wide variety of functions, including absorption, secretion, cellular adhesion, and mechanotransduction. They are present in the duodenum, where they increase the surface area for absorption of nutrients. They are also present in the proximal convoluted tubule, where they increase the surface area for reabsorption of water and solutes. The gallbladder also has microvilli that increase the surface area for absorption of water and electrolytes. However, the collecting duct in the kidney, which is involved in the final concentration of urine, does not have microvilli.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Collecting duct\"}"
