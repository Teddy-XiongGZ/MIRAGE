    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart, usually the valves, caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and settling in the heart. Emboli from infective endocarditis can travel to any part of the body. However, the pattern of embolization depends on whether the infection is on the right or left side of the heart. In a patient with mitral valve vegetations, the infection is on the left side of the heart. Emboli from the left side of the heart usually travel to the systemic circulation, which includes the brain, liver, and spleen. They do not typically travel to the lungs because the lungs are part of the pulmonary circulation, which is supplied by the right side of the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lungs\"}"
