    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding. This results in people bleeding for a longer time after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain. Therefore, the bleeding time would be normal, as this is the time it takes for a small skin wound to stop bleeding. However, the clotting time, which is the time it takes for blood to form a clot, would be increased due to the lack of clotting factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
