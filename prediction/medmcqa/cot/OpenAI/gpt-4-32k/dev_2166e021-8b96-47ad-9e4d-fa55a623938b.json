    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Tuberculin test, also known as the Mantoux test, is used to check for tuberculosis. The test can be less reliable in certain situations. If a person has been immunized with the BCG vaccine, they may have a false positive result. This is because the vaccine contains a strain of mycobacterium that is similar to the one that causes tuberculosis. Therefore, a high percentage of immunized people can lead to a high failure in the interpretation of the test. HIV cases and environmental mycobacterium infections being less do not directly affect the interpretation of the test. A high prevalence of the disease could potentially lead to more false positives, but not necessarily a failure in interpretation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
