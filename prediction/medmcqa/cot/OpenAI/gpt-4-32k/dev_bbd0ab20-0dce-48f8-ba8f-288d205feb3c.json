    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lytic lesions in the upper femur of a child can be caused by several conditions. Plasmacytoma is a type of cancer that develops in plasma cells, which can cause lytic lesions. Browns tumour is a type of lesion that can occur in patients with hyperparathyroidism, which can also cause lytic lesions. Histiocytosis is a group of diseases that involve an over-production of white blood cells known as histiocytes, which can lead to lytic lesions. However, metastasis, which is the spread of cancer cells from the place where they first formed to another part of the body, is highly unlikely in a 10-year-old child as primary cancers that metastasize to bones (like breast, lung, prostate) are extremely rare in this age group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
