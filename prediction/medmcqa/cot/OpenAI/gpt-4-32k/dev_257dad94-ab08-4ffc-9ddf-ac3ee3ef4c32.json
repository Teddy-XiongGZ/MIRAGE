    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Guiding cusps, also known as functional cusps, are the cusps of the teeth that make primary contact with the cusps of the opposing teeth during occlusion. They are designed to fit into the grooves of the opposing teeth. The buccal groove is the groove that runs downward on the buccal (cheek side) surface of the posterior teeth. The lingual groove is the groove that runs downward on the lingual (tongue side) surface of the posterior teeth. Embrasures are the V-shaped spaces between the contacting surfaces of adjacent teeth. Guiding cusps do not occlude in embrasures, they occlude in the grooves of the opposing teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Buccal groove. B. Lingual groove.\"}"
