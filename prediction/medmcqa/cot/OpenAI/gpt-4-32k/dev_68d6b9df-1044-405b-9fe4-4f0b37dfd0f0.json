    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The physiological pH is around 7.4. At this pH, amino acids with acidic side chains (like aspartic acid) are deprotonated and thus carry a negative charge. Amino acids with aliphatic side chains (like valine and isoleucine) are neutral. However, amino acids with basic side chains (like arginine) are protonated and thus carry a positive charge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Arginine\"}"
