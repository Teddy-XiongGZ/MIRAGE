    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MI stands for myocardial infarction, which is commonly known as a heart attack. When a heart attack occurs, certain proteins are released into the bloodstream as heart muscle cells die. These proteins are known as cardiac biomarkers. CPK stands for creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. The different types of CPK (MM, MB, BB) are found in different parts of the body. CPK MM is found mostly in skeletal muscle, CPK MB is found mostly in the heart, and CPK BB is found mostly in the brain. Therefore, the best biochemical marker for a heart attack would be the one that is most specific to the heart, which is CPK MB.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
