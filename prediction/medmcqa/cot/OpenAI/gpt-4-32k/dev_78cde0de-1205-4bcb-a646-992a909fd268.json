    "The neonatal mortality rate is calculated as the number of neonatal deaths (deaths within the first 28 days of life) per 1,000 live births in a given year. Step 1: Identify the number of neonatal deaths. In this case, it's 450. Step 2: Identify the number of live births. In this case, it's 12,450. Step 3: Divide the number of neonatal deaths by the number of live births. This gives us 0.036. Step 4: Multiply the result by 1,000 to get the neonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births. This gives us 36. Therefore, the neonatal mortality rate for this population in 2012 is 36 per 1,000 live births. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Identify the number of neonatal deaths, which is 450.
