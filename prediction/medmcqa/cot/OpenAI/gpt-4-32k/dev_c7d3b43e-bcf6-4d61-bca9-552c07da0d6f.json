    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypoglycemia in newborns can be caused by several factors. Birth asphyxia can lead to hypoglycemia due to the increased metabolic demand and decreased glycogen stores. Respiratory distress syndrome can also lead to hypoglycemia due to the increased metabolic demand. Maternal diabetes can lead to hypoglycemia in the newborn due to hyperinsulinemia.
