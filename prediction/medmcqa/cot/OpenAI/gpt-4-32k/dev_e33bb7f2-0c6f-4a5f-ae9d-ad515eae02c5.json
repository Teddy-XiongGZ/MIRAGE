    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Density is a measure of mass per unit volume. Lower density means that there is less mass in a given volume. This does not directly relate to strength, as strength is a measure of how much stress a material can withstand before failing. It also does not directly relate to melting temperature, as this is a property of the specific material and its atomic structure. However, lower density does mean that for a given volume, the material will weigh less, as weight is directly related to mass.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lighter weight\"}"
