    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels. It results from relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls. Serotonin can cause both vasoconstriction and vasodilation depending on the type of blood vessels. Thromboxane A2 is a vasoconstrictor. LT C4 is a leukotriene that causes vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction. Histamine, on the other hand, is a compound that is released by cells in response to injury and in allergic and inflammatory reactions, causing contraction of smooth muscle and dilation of capillaries, which is vasodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
