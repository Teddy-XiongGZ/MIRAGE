    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that affects the shape and functionality of the red blood cells. It is not a result of gene deletion, as the gene is still present. It is also not a result of a frame shift mutation, which would change the reading frame of the gene. Instead, sickle cell anemia is caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the gene that codes for the beta chain of hemoglobin, which is a point mutation. Therefore, it is not a gene modification in the broader sense, but a specific type of gene modification known as a point mutation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
