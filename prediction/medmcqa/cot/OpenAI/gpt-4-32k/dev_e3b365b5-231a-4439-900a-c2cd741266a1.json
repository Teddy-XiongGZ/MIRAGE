    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The described deformity is known as 'claw hand'. This is typically caused by an injury to the ulnar nerve, which innervates the muscles responsible for flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints and extending the interphalangeal joints.

Therefore, an injury to this nerve would result in the described deformity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Deep branch of ulnar nerve\"}"
