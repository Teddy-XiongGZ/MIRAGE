    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a blood glycoprotein involved in hemostasis. It is not secreted by macrophages, which are involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation, nor by fibroblasts, which are involved in the synthesis of the extracellular matrix and collagen. Platelets do store vWF, but they do not secrete it. The primary cells that produce and secrete vWF are endothelial cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Endothelial cells\"}"
