    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The otic ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion located just below the foramen ovale in the infratemporal fossa. It receives preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the glossopharyngeal nerve via the lesser petrosal nerve. The greater petrosal nerve carries fibers to the pterygopalatine ganglion, not the otic ganglion. The chorda tympani carries taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular ganglion. The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3) and carries sensory fibers from the skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lesser petrosal nerve\"}"
