    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RPD stands for Removable Partial Denture. The main cause of RPD failure can be attributed to several factors. However, among the options given, improper clasp design and insufficient contact of teeth are two significant factors. The clasp design is crucial as it helps in the retention of the denture. If it's not designed properly, it can lead to instability and discomfort, leading to failure of the RPD. Similarly, insufficient contact of teeth can also lead to instability and improper functioning of the RPD. Therefore, both factors are equally important and can lead to RPD failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
