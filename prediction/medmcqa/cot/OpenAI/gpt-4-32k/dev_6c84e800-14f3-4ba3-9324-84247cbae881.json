    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The visual pathway begins with the photoreceptors in the retina. These photoreceptors are the first to receive and process light information, making them the first order neurons in the visual pathway. The signal then passes to the bipolar neurons, and then to the ganglion cells. The lateral geniculate body is a relay center in the thalamus for the visual pathway, but it is not a neuron, so it cannot be the first order neuron.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Photoreceptor\"}"
