    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a group of specialized connective tissue fibers that essentially attach a tooth to the alveolar bone within which it sits. When a tooth is tipped, it means that it is being moved or tilted from its original position. This movement would cause the fibers on one side of the PDL to be compressed as the tooth moves towards them, while the fibers on the opposite side would be stretched as the tooth moves away from them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Half compressed half stretched\"}"
