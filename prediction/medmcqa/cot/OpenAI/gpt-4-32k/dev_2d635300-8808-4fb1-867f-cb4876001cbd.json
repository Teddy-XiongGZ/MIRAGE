    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The energy storage capacity of orthodontic wire is described by its ability to return to its original shape after being deformed. This characteristic is known as resilience. Range refers to the extent of movement a wire can undergo before it deforms permanently. Formability refers to the ease with which a wire can be bent into a desired shape. Proportional limit refers to the maximum stress a material can withstand without any permanent deformation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Resilience\"}"
