    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute bacterial meningitis is a severe infection of the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid. The most common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The drug of choice should be a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can cross the blood-brain barrier. Erythromycin is primarily used for respiratory tract infections and skin infections. Sulfisoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic used for urinary tract infections and ear infections. Cefoperazone is a third-generation cephalosporin, but it is not the first choice for meningitis. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and can cross the blood-brain barrier, making it a good choice for meningitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ceftriaxone\"}"
