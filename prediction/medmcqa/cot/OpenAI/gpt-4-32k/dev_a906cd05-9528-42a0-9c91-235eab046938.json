    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intrusion refers to the displacement of a tooth into the alveolar bone, which doesn't necessarily involve the destruction of the protective layer. Extrusion refers to the displacement of a tooth out of its socket, which also doesn't necessarily involve the destruction of the protective layer. Avulsion refers to the complete displacement of a tooth from its socket, which could potentially involve the destruction of the protective layer. Lateral luxation refers to the displacement of a tooth in a direction other than axially, which doesn't necessarily involve the destruction of the protective layer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
