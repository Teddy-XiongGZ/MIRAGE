    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The thyroid cartilage is a part of the larynx and has several muscles attached to it. The Sternothyroid muscle originates from the posterior surface of the manubrium of the sternum and inserts into the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage, so option A is incorrect. The Thyrohyoid muscle extends from the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone, so option B is incorrect. The Superior constrictor muscle is a part of the pharynx and not directly attached to the thyroid cartilage, making option C a possible answer. The Inferior constrictor muscle is attached to the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage, so option D is incorrect. Therefore, the muscle that is not attached to the thyroid cartilage is the Superior constrictor muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
