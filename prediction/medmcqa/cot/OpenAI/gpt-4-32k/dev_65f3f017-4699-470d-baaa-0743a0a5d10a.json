    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner layer of the heart, the endocardium. It typically occurs when bacteria or other germs from another part of your body, such as your mouth, spread through your bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in your heart. It is usually seen in people with heart valve diseases or congenital heart diseases. ASD (Atrial Septal Defect), TOF (Tetralogy of Fallot), and VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect) are all types of congenital heart diseases where there is a structural defect in the heart, which makes them susceptible to infective endocarditis. MR (Mitral Regurgitation) is a valve disease, but it is not a structural heart defect, so it is less likely to cause infective endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
