    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It's a fairly common condition that affects over 3 million people in the UK. PTH (Parathyroid hormone) is used in the treatment of osteoporosis as it stimulates bone formation. Strontium ranelate is also used in the treatment of osteoporosis as it helps to reduce the risk of fractures. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody and is also used in the treatment of osteoporosis as it inhibits osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. Milnacipran, on the other hand, is a serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used in the clinical management of fibromyalgia and is not used in the treatment of osteoporosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
