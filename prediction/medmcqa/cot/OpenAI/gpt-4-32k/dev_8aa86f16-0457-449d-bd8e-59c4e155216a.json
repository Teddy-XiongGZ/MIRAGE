    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A diffuse spreading inflammatory lesion is typically caused by an enzyme that breaks down the connective tissue, allowing the bacteria to spread. Coagulase is an enzyme that clots blood, not related to spreading of bacteria. Peroxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of certain substances by peroxides, also not related to bacterial spreading. Bradykinin is a peptide that causes blood vessels to dilate, and therefore causes blood pressure to fall, not directly related to bacterial spreading. Hyaluronidase, on the other hand, is an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, a component of the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting the spread of the bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Hyaluronidase\"}"
