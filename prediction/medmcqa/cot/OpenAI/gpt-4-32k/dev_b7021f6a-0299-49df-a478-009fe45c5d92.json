    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Hidden X suture is a suturing technique used in periodontal and implant surgeries. It is specifically designed for the repositioning of flaps. Among the options, alveolar ridge preservation is not about repositioning flaps, it's about preserving the alveolar ridge after tooth extraction. Apical repositioning flap is a technique used to expose more of the tooth's root surface, but it's not specifically related to the Hidden X suture. Coronal repositioning flap and Papillae repositioning flap are both about repositioning flaps. However, the Hidden X suture is specifically used for the coronal repositioning of the flap, which is a technique used to cover exposed root surfaces and to increase the amount of keratinized tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Coronal repositioning flap\"}"
