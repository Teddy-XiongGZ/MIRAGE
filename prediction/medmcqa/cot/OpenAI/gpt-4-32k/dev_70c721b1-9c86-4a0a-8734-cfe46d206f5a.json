    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The filtration process in radiography is designed to remove low energy, short wavelength photons from the x-ray beam. These photons are not useful in creating the image, but they do contribute to the patient's radiation dose. Therefore, by removing these photons, the filtration process reduces the patient's exposure to radiation without compromising the quality of the image.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
