    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, is often referred to as 'bad cholesterol'. It is primarily recognized and taken up by the liver through LDL receptors. These receptors specifically recognize and bind to Apo B-100, a protein that is part of the LDL particle. Apo E is also involved in the uptake of lipoproteins by the liver, but it is not specific to LDL. Therefore, both Apo B-100 and Apo E are involved in the uptake of LDL by the liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Apo E and Apo B-100\"}"
