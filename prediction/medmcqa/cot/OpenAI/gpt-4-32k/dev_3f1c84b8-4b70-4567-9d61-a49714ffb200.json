    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Traumatic shoulder dislocation is a common injury in young adults, often resulting from sports or other physical activities. While all of the options listed can potentially occur following a shoulder dislocation, the most common sequelae is recurrent shoulder dislocation. This is because the initial dislocation often damages the ligaments and tendons that stabilize the shoulder, making it more prone to future dislocations. Rotator cuff tears are more common in older adults, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) is not typically a direct result of trauma, and subscapular tendinitis is not the most common sequelae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Recurrent shoulder dislocation\"}"
