    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium valproate is known to have teratogenic effects and is not recommended during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Lamotrigine is considered safer during pregnancy and is often used as an alternative. However, it should not be added to sodium valproate, but rather replace it. Carbamazepine is also a potential alternative, but it has a higher risk of causing birth defects compared to lamotrigine. Continuing sodium valproate with regular monitoring of serum levels is not a good option because the risk of birth defects is not related to the dose or serum levels of the drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Taper sodium valproate and add lamotrigine\"}"
