    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is typically not present in urine because the kidneys reabsorb it. However, when blood glucose levels are high, such as in diabetes mellitus, the kidneys may not be able to reabsorb all of the glucose, leading to its presence in urine. This is when the renal threshold for glucose is exceeded. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by excessive thirst and excretion of large amounts of severely diluted urine, not glucose in urine. Consuming excess sugar over long years can contribute to the development of diabetes mellitus, but it's not a direct cause of glucose in urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
