    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A meningomyelocele is a type of spina bifida where an area of the spinal cord and the tissues around it protrude from an opening in the spine. This condition is present at birth and can cause a range of symptoms, including problems with the skin, muscles, bones, and nerves. The leaky meningomyelocele mentioned in the question refers to a wound or opening in the skin over the defect that is leaking cerebrospinal fluid. In this case, the most useful test for diagnosis and management would be to identify any potential infection at the site of the wound. Blood, urine, and rectal swab cultures would not be as useful because they would not directly test the site of the problem.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Wound swab\u2013culture and sensitivity\"}"
