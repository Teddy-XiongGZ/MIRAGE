    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-menopausal bleeding is a concerning symptom that requires further investigation. Trans-vaginal sonography is often used to measure the thickness of the endometrium, which can help identify potential causes of the bleeding. Generally, an endometrial thickness of 5mm or more in a post-menopausal woman is considered abnormal and may warrant further investigation. Therefore, if the endometrial thickness is less than 5mm, it is less likely that the bleeding is due to an endometrial abnormality, and other causes may need to be considered. However, if the endometrial thickness is 5mm or more, trans-vaginal sonography would be indicated to further investigate the cause of the bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 5mm\"}"
