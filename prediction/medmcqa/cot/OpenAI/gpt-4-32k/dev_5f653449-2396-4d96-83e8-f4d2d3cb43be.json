    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of transfer of information from RNA to proteins is a fundamental part of gene expression. This process is not mutation, as mutation refers to a change in the DNA sequence. It's also not conjugation, which is a type of genetic recombination in bacteria. Transcription is the process of creating an RNA copy of a sequence of DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is translation, which is the process where the genetic code carried by mRNA is decoded to produce the specific sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain, or protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Translation\"}"
