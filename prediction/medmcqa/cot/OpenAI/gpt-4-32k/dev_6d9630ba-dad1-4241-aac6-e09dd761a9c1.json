    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microcephaly is a condition where a baby's head is much smaller than expected. It can occur if the brain has not developed properly during pregnancy or has stopped growing after birth. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Hepatitis A are not typically associated with microcephaly. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic disorder that can lead to intellectual disability, but it does not cause microcephaly. Rubella, however, if contracted by a pregnant woman, can lead to a number of birth defects, including microcephaly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. bd\"}"
