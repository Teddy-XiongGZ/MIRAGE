    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Collagen is a protein that provides structure and strength to various tissues in the body. It is composed of three polypeptide chains, each of which is a sequence of amino acids. Among these amino acids, proline and glycine are the most abundant. However, the strength of collagen is attributed to the presence of hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline is a derivative of the amino acid proline, and it is unique to collagen. It helps to stabilize the triple helix structure of collagen, which contributes to its strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hydroxyproline\"}"
