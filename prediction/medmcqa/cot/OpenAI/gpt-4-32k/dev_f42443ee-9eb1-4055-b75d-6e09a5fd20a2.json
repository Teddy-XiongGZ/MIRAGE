    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optimal landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation in endodontic treatment is the apical constriction. This is the narrowest part of the root canal and is the ideal location for the end of the root canal filling. The cementodentinal junction is not a reliable landmark because it can be resorbed or destroyed by pathological processes. The minor diameter is not a specific anatomical landmark and can vary greatly between teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Apical constriction\"}"
