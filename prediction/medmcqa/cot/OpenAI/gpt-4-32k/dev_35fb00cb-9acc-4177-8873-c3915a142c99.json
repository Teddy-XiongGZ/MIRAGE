    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that exists as yeast at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius) and as mold (hyphae) at room temperature (25 degrees Celsius). However, the same is true for Candida albicans. Sporothrix globosa is a dimorphic fungus, but it typically exists as yeast at both temperatures. Cryptococcus neoformans is not dimorphic and exists primarily as yeast. The question is asking for a fungus that exists as yeast at 37 degrees and hyphae at 25 degrees, so the answer is either Histoplasma capsulatum or Candida albicans. However, Candida albicans is more commonly associated with this temperature-dependent morphological change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Candida albicans\"}"
