    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The release of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic terminal is a process known as exocytosis. This process is triggered by the influx of calcium ions into the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, if the influx of calcium is prevented, the release of synaptic vesicles would be inhibited.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Prevention of calcium influx\"}"
