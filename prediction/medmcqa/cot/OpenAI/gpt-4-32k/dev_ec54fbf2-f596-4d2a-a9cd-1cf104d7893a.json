    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Leukoplakia and focal hyperkeratosis are conditions that cause white patches or spots on the mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth. These lesions are typically firm and do not disappear when stretched. Typhoid is a systemic infection and does not cause lesions in the mouth. Leukoedema, on the other hand, is a benign, chronic alteration of the buccal mucosa that appears as a milky, opalescent change in the mucosa. When the cheek is stretched, the opalescence disappears, indicating leukoedema.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Leukoedema\"}"
