    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parotid gland is the largest of the salivary glands and is located in front of the ear extending to the area beneath the earlobe. The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) runs through the parotid gland, and it is at risk during parotid gland surgery. The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3), also passes through the parotid gland and can be damaged during surgery. The lesser occipital nerve, hypoglossal nerve, and chorda tympani are not directly related to the parotid gland. The submandibular duct and cervical fascia are also not directly related to the parotid gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
