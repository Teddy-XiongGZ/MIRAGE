    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The crossed extensor reflex is a type of reflex that helps maintain balance when one foot withdraws from a painful stimulus. It is a complex reflex that involves multiple synapses, so it is not a monosynaptic reflex. It is not related to the sympathetic nervous system, so it is not a sympathetic reflex. It is a withdrawal reflex because it involves pulling away from a harmful stimulus, but it also involves extending the opposite limb to maintain balance, which is a postural response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Postural reflex\"}"
