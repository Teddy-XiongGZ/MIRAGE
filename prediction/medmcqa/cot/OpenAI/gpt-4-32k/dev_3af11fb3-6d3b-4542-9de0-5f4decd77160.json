    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA replication and transcription both occur in the 5' to 3' direction. This is because DNA polymerase, the enzyme that synthesizes new DNA strands, can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand. Similarly, RNA polymerase, which synthesizes RNA during transcription, also adds nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction. DNA repair also occurs in the 5' to 3' direction. However, RNA editing does not have a specific directionality like replication, transcription, or repair. It can occur at any location within the RNA molecule, not necessarily from one end to the other.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. RNA editing\"}"
