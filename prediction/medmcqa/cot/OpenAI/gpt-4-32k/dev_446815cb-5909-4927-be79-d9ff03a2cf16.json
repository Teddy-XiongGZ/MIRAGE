    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid prototyping is a group of techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model of a physical part or assembly using three-dimensional computer aided design (CAD) data. Photopolymer resin is indeed cured with a laser in a process called stereolithography, which is a type of rapid prototyping. Fused deposition modeling is a 3D printing process where a plastic filament is melted and deposited layer by layer, but it doesn't involve powder. Selective laser sintering is another type of rapid prototyping where a laser is used to sinter powdered material, binding it together to create a solid structure. Therefore, the statements A and C are correct, but B is not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
