    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant's skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone, changing the growth pattern of the skull. Syndromic craniosynostosis is often associated with genetic mutations. FGFR mutations, specifically in FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, are known to cause several types of syndromic craniosynostosis, including Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome. IRFS mutations, VWS mutations, and 22q 11.2 mutations are not typically associated with syndromic craniosynostosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. FGFR mutations\"}"
