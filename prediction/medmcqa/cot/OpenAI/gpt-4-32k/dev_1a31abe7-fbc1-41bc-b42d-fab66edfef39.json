    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cholesterol is a type of lipid that is transported in the blood by lipoproteins. There are four main types of lipoproteins: VLDL, LDL, HDL, and chylomicrons. VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein) carries triglycerides and a small amount of cholesterol. HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) is often referred to as 'good cholesterol' because it carries cholesterol from other parts of the body back to the liver, where it can be removed. Chylomicrons are the largest lipoproteins and transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other parts of the body. LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) is often referred to as 'bad cholesterol' because it carries most of the cholesterol in the blood and can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries. Therefore, the most important carrier of cholesterol in plasma is LDL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
