    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A condylar fracture refers to a break in the condyle, which is the rounded protrusion at the end of a bone, such as the mandible (jawbone). The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that connects the jawbone to the skull. A disruption of the TMJ would involve more than just a simple break in the bone, it would involve damage to the joint as well. A simple fracture is a break in the bone that does not damage surrounding tissue or break the skin. A compound fracture is a break in the bone that causes the bone to come through the skin. A complex fracture is a break that involves more than just the bone, such as the surrounding soft tissue or joints. A comminuted fracture is a break or splinter of the bone into more than two fragments. Since the question mentions a disruption of the TMJ, this would be more than just a simple or compound fracture. It would not necessarily be a comminuted fracture, as this involves the bone breaking into multiple pieces. Therefore, the most likely answer is a complex fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
