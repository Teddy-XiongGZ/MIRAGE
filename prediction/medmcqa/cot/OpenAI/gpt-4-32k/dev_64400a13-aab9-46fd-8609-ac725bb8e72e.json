    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is the rate at which the kidneys filter blood. It is influenced by several factors. Increased renal blood flow (A) would increase GFR because more blood is being filtered. Efferent arteriole constriction (B) would also increase GFR because it increases the pressure in the glomerulus, leading to more filtration. Decreased oncotic pressure (D) would increase GFR because it reduces the reabsorption of fluid in the renal tubules, leading to more filtration. However, a renal stone in the ureter (C) would not increase GFR. Instead, it could obstruct the flow of urine, leading to a decrease in GFR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
