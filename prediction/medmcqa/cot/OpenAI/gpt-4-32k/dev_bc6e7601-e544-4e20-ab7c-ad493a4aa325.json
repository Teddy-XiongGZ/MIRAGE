The low T4 and raised TSH levels indicate that the thyroid is not producing enough thyroid hormone, and the pituitary gland is trying to stimulate it to produce more, which is a classic sign of primary hypothyroidism. However, the swelling of the pituitary could indicate a pituitary tumor or adenoma. A TSH secreting pituitary adenoma would cause high levels of TSH, but it would also cause high levels of T4, not low. TSH resistance would also cause high levels of TSH, but again, it would cause high levels of T4, not low. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary hypothyroidism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
