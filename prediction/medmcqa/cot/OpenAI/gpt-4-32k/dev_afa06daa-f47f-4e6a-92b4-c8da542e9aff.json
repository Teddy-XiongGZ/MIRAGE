    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Magnesium is a cofactor that is needed for the activity of many enzymes. Among the options given, ATPase is an enzyme that requires magnesium for its activity. ATPase is responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, a process that is crucial for energy transfer in cells. Magnesium is needed to stabilize the negative charges on the phosphate groups in ATP, allowing ATPase to function properly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. ATPase\"}"
