    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of edema, oliguria, and frothy urine, along with the lab findings of 3+ proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, suggest a nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. The absence of RBCs, WBCs, and casts in the urine rules out nephritic syndromes like IgA nephropathy and interstitial nephritis. Among the choices, minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy are both causes of nephrotic syndrome. However, minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, while membranous nephropathy is more common in adults. Since the patient's age is not specified, we cannot use this criterion to differentiate. However, minimal change disease often presents acutely with no past history of similar complaints, while membranous nephropathy often has a more insidious onset. Therefore, minimal change disease is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
