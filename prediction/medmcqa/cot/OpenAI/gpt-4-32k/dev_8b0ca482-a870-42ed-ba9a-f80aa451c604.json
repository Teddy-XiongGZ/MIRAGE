    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A surveyor in dentistry is a precision instrument used in the construction of partial dentures. It helps to locate the guiding planes, which are the parallel axial surfaces of abutment teeth. However, it is not primarily used for this purpose. It doesn't determine aesthetics, as this is more related to the dentist's skill and patient's preference. It doesn't delineate areas of maximum convexity either. The main function of a surveyor is to locate undercuts on the master cast. These undercuts can be used for retention of the denture or need to be blocked out to ensure proper fit and function of the denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
