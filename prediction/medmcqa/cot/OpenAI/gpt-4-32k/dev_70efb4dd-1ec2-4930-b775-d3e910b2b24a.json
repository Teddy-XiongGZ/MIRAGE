    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A major connector in a removable partial denture (RPD) is the part of the prosthesis that connects the parts of the prosthesis located on one side of the arch with those on the opposite side. It should be rigid to provide stability and to distribute functional and parafunctional forces evenly to the abutment teeth and edentulous ridge areas. If the major connector is flexible, it will not provide the necessary stability and rigidity, which can lead to an ill-fitting RPD and potentially cause damage to the periodontal ligament (PDL) of the abutment teeth due to uneven force distribution. It can also cause difficulty in occlusion as the RPD may not fit properly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Will cause PDL destruction of abutment teeth, C. Cause ill-fitting of RPD, D. Will cause difficulty in occlusion\"}"
