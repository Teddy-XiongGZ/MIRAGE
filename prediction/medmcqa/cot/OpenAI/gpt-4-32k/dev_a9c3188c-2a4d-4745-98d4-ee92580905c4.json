    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on mechanical ventilation breathing machines in hospitals. As such, it's important to maintain good oral hygiene to prevent bacteria from the mouth from being inhaled into the lungs. Betadine mouthwash, manual brushing, and powered brushing are all methods of maintaining oral hygiene, but they do not specifically target the bacteria that can cause VAP.
