    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi. The diagnosis of typhoid can be made by several methods. Blood culture is usually positive in the first week of infection, but its sensitivity decreases after the first week. The Widal test, which measures antibodies against Salmonella, becomes positive after the first week and is usually used for diagnosis after the first week of illness. Stool and urine cultures can also be positive, but they are less sensitive and specific than blood culture and Widal test. Therefore, in a patient with typhoid, diagnosis after 15 days of onset of fever is best done by the Widal test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Widal test\"}"
