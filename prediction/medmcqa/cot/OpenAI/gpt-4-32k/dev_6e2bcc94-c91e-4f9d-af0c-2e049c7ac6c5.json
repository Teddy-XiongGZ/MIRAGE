    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the systolic blood pressure in healthy males aged 40-60 has a normal distribution with a mean of 130. In a normal distribution, about 50% of the values lie above the mean and 50% lie below the mean. Therefore, if the mean systolic blood pressure is 130, then about 50% of the sample will have a systolic blood pressure greater than 130.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
