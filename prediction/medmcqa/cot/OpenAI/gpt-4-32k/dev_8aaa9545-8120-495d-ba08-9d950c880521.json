    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"S-ECC stands for Severe Early Childhood Caries, a form of tooth decay in young children. The patient is experiencing recurrent gingival swelling and pain in teeth 61 and 62, which are the upper central incisors. The severity of the condition and the age of the patient are important factors to consider. Endodontic treatment is usually not recommended for such young patients due to the complexity of the procedure and the difficulty in managing patient cooperation. Restoration might not be a viable option if the decay is severe. Fluoride application is more of a preventive measure and won't help in this case where the caries is already severe. Therefore, extraction seems to be the most appropriate treatment in this case to eliminate the source of infection and pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Extraction\"}"
