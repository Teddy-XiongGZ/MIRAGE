    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cremaster reflex is a superficial (i.e., close to the skin) reflex observed in human males. This reflex is elicited by lightly stroking the superior and medial (inner) part of the thigh\u2014regardless of the direction of stroke. The normal response is an immediate contraction of the cremaster muscle that pulls up the testis ipsilaterally (on the same side of the body). The afferent limb of the reflex is the ilioinguinal nerve and the efferent limb is the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve. Both of these nerves are derived from the lumbar plexus, which is formed by the ventral rami of the lumbar spinal nerves L1-L4. Therefore, the root value of the cremaster reflex is L1, L2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
