    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ewing's sarcoma is characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation, t(11;22). To detect this, we need a method that can identify specific chromosomal rearrangements. Conventional karyotyping is not sensitive enough to detect this specific translocation. Next generation sequencing is a powerful tool for detecting genetic mutations, but it may not be the best choice for detecting chromosomal translocations. PCR could potentially be used, but it requires knowledge of the exact sequences that are translocated, which may not always be known. FISH, or Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization, is a technique that uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of the chromosome with which they show a high degree of sequence complementarity. It is commonly used to visualize and map the genetic material in an individual's cells, including specific genes or portions of genes. This makes it the best choice for detecting a specific chromosomal translocation like t(11;22).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
