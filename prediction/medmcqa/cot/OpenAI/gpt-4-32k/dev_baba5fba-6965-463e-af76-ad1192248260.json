    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zygomatic arch is a bony structure on the side of the skull, and it forms part of the cheekbone. When it's fractured and depressed, it can interfere with the movement of the mandible, or lower jaw. The part of the mandible that would be most likely to be affected is the coronoid process, which is a thin, triangular eminence, which is flattened from side to side and varies in size and shape. It's the highest part of the mandible, and it's the part that would be most likely to come into contact with a depressed zygomatic arch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Coronoid process\"}"
