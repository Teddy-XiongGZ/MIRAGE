    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The submandibular gland is located in the neck, and it is responsible for producing saliva. When performing surgery on this gland, an incision is made 2 cm below the border of the mandible to avoid damaging the marginal mandibular nerve. This nerve is a branch of the facial nerve that provides motor innervation to the muscles of the lower lip and chin. The other nerves listed, the mental nerve, the long buccal nerve branch of facial, and the inferior alveolar nerve, are not in close proximity to the submandibular gland and therefore are not at risk during this type of surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Marginal mandibular nerve\"}"
