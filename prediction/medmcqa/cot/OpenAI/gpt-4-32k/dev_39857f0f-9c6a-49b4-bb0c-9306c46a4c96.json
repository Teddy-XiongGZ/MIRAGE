    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tongue thrusting is a condition where the tongue pushes against or between the teeth while a person is at rest, swallowing or speaking. This can lead to a number of dental issues. Spaced dentition (A) can occur as the tongue pushes the teeth apart. Crowding and crossbite (B) can also occur as the tongue pushes the teeth out of alignment. Open bite (C) is a common feature of tongue thrusting where the teeth do not meet when the mouth is closed. However, flush terminal plane (D) is a term used to describe the relationship of the upper and lower molars in children, and it is not directly related to tongue thrusting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
