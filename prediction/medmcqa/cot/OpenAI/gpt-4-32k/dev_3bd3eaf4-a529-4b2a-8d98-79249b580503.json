    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CLED (Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient) medium is a type of agar used in microbiology to culture urine specimens. It does not differentiate lactose fermenters from non-lactose fermenters, so option A is incorrect. It does not specifically identify pseudomonas, so option C is incorrect. While it does allow the growth of various organisms including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and candida, this is not the primary reason it is preferred over MacConkey medium for urine samples, so option D is incorrect. The main advantage of CLED medium over MacConkey medium is that it prevents the swarming of Proteus species, which can overgrow other colonies and make interpretation difficult.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
