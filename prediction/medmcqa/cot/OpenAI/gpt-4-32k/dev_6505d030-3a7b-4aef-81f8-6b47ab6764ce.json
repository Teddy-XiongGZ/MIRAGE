    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tip of an ultrasonic scaler, like any other dental instrument, needs to be properly cleaned and sterilized after usage to prevent cross-contamination. Running it under water for 2 minutes (option A) might remove visible debris but it won't sterilize the instrument. Chemical cleaning (option B) can be a part of the cleaning process, but it also doesn't guarantee sterilization. The autoclave (option C), on the other hand, uses high pressure and temperature to kill all microorganisms, including spores, making it the most effective method for sterilizing dental instruments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
