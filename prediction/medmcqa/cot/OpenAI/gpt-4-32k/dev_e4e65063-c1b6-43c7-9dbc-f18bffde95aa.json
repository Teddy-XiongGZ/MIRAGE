    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Condensation shrinkage of porcelain during firing is a process that involves the reduction in volume of the porcelain as it is heated. This process is not dependent on the rate of arriving at firing temperature, as this would affect the rate of shrinkage, not the amount. The uniformity and shape and size of the particles can affect the packing density of the porcelain, which can in turn affect the amount of shrinkage. However, the type of investment used does not directly affect the shrinkage of the porcelain during firing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Uniformity of particle size.\"}"
