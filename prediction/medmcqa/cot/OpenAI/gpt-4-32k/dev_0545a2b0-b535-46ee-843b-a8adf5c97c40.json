It often occurs after an infection of the roots of the teeth or a mouth injury. This condition is characterized by bilateral swelling and elevation of the floor of the mouth due to swelling, which can cause the tongue to be raised and displaced posteriorly. Trismus, or lockjaw, is not typically associated with Ludwig's angina. Elevation of the ear lobe and unilateral swelling are not characteristic of Ludwig's angina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
