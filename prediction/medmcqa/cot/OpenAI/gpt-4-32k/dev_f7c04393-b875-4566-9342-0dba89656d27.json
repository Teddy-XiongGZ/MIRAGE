The histopathology report from his mitral valve would provide more specific information about the nature of the disease. Sarcoidosis typically presents with non-caseating granulomas, not specifically related to the heart. Fungal granuloma and Tuberculosis could potentially affect the heart, but they are less common and would typically present with other systemic symptoms.
