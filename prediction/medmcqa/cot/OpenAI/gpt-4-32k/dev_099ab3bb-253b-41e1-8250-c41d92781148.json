    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by systemic activation of blood coagulation, which results in generation and deposition of fibrin, leading to microvascular thrombi in various organs and contributing to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). In DIC, the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are usually prolonged due to consumption of clotting factors. D-dimer levels are typically elevated because this is a product of fibrin degradation, which occurs in DIC. However, clot solubility is not a test typically associated with abnormalities in DIC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
