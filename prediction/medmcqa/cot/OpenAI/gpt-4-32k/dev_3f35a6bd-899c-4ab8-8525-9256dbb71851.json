    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dense irregular connective tissue is a type of connective tissue that has fibers that are not arranged in a parallel fashion, which gives it the ability to resist tension from many different directions. This type of tissue is found in areas where tension is exerted in various directions. The dermis, the layer of skin beneath the epidermis, is one such area. The lamina propria, tendons, and ligaments, on the other hand, contain other types of connective tissue. Tendons and ligaments contain dense regular connective tissue, which is arranged in parallel bundles to resist tension in one direction, while the lamina propria contains loose connective tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
