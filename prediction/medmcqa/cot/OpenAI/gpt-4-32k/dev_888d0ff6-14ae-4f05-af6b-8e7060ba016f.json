    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Feedforward control is a mechanism where the body anticipates changes in a regulated variable and starts making adjustments even before the change occurs. ADH is controlled by feedback control, not feedforward. It is released when the body is dehydrated and needs to conserve water. Insulin is also controlled by feedback control. It is released when blood glucose levels are high. Corticosteroids are controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is a feedback system. Prolactin, on the other hand, is controlled by feedforward control. It is released in anticipation of breastfeeding, even before the baby starts to suckle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Prolactin\"}"
