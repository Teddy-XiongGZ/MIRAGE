    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adenoameloblastoma is a rare type of ameloblastoma, which is a benign but locally aggressive tumor that originates in the odontogenic epithelium. The treatment of choice for ameloblastomas, including adenoameloblastoma, is surgical removal. The extent of the surgery depends on the size and location of the tumor. Enucleation is often used for smaller tumors, while larger tumors may require more extensive surgery such as en bloc resection. Marsupialization is a less common treatment that involves creating an opening in the tumor to allow it to drain, but it is not typically the first line of treatment. No treatment is not an option as the tumor can continue to grow and cause significant problems.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Enucleation\"}"
