    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High copper silver alloy is known for its increased tensile and compressive strength, so option A is true. It also has greater edge strength, making option C true. The mercury content in the final restoration is indeed less with high copper silver alloy, so option D is also true. This leaves us with option B, which states that high copper silver alloy has poor tarnish and corrosion resistance. However, high copper silver alloys are known for their excellent tarnish and corrosion resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
