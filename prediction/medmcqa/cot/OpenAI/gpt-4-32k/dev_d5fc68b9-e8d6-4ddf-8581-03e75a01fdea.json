    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neuronal migration and organization are crucial processes in the development of the brain. Any delay or disruption in these processes can lead to a variety of neurological disorders. Lissencephaly, Schizencephaly, and Polymicrogyria are all conditions that are directly associated with abnormal neuronal migration and organization. Focal cortical dysplasia, on the other hand, is a condition that can occur with or without balloon cells. The presence of balloon cells is not directly linked to delayed neuronal migration and organization, making it the least likely possibility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
