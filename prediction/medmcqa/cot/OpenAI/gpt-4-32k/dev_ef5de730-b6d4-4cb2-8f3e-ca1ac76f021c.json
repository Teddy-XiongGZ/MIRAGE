    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intubation is a procedure that's used when you can't breathe on your own. Your doctor puts a tube down your throat and into your windpipe to make it easier to get air into and out of your lungs. A machine called a ventilator pumps in air with extra oxygen. Then it helps you breathe out air that's full of carbon dioxide (a waste gas). In long surgical procedures, the intubation method used is typically an endotracheal tube. This is because it provides a secure airway and allows for positive pressure ventilation. Nasotracheal tubes, whether with or without a cuff, are typically used for surgeries involving the mouth or face where an oral tube would be in the way. LIMA refers to Left Internal Mammary Artery, which is not related to intubation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Endotracheal tube\"}"
