    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heparin is an anticoagulant, which means it prevents blood clots. It does this by binding to a substance in the body called antithrombin III, which inhibits several coagulation factors, most notably thrombin and Factor Xa. Thrombin is the enzyme that converts fibrinogen to fibrin, which forms the structure of a clot. However, heparin's primary action is not to prevent this conversion directly, but to inhibit the formation of thrombin itself. Therefore, the main mechanism of action of heparin is to prevent the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Conversion of prothrombin to thrombin\"}"
