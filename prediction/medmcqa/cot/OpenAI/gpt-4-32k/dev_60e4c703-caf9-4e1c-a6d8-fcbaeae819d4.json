    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Skeletal muscles contract through a process known as the sliding filament theory. This process involves the interaction of actin and myosin filaments, but these filaments do not shorten during contraction, they slide past each other. Therefore, option B is incorrect. The contraction of skeletal muscles is initiated when calcium ions bind to troponin, a protein that is part of the thin filament. This binding causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex, exposing the myosin-binding sites on actin and allowing the myosin heads to bind to actin, initiating contraction. Therefore, option C is correct. Calcium is indeed taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but this happens after contraction to allow the muscle to relax, not to initiate contraction. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Calcium does not bind to tropomyosin to initiate contraction, it binds to troponin. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
