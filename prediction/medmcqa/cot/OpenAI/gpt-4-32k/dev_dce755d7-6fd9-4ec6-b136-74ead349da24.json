    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The carat of gold is a measure of its purity. The higher the carat, the purer the gold. For dental restorations, the gold used needs to be pure enough to avoid causing any reactions or infections, but not so pure that it becomes too soft and malleable. 24 carat gold is considered pure gold, but it is too soft for dental restorations. 18 carat gold is often used in jewelry, but it may still be too soft for dental restorations. Therefore, 22 carat gold is often used for dental restorations as it strikes a balance between purity and hardness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
