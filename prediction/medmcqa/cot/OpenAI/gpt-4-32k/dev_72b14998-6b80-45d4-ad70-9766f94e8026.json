    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iron is a divalent cation, meaning it carries a charge of +2. It is absorbed in the duodenum and upper jejunum of the small intestine by enterocytes. The process of iron absorption involves its transport across the apical surface of enterocytes via a specific carrier protein. This protein is known as the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) or divalent cation transporter. Ferroportin, Hephaestin, and Ceruloplasmin are involved in the export of iron from the enterocytes into the bloodstream, not in the initial entry of iron into the enterocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Divalent cation transpoer\"}"
