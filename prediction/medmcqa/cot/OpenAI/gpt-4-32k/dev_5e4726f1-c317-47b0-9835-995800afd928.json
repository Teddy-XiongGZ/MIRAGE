    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental plaque is a biofilm or mass of bacteria that grows on surfaces within the mouth. It is a sticky colorless deposit at first, but when it forms tartar, it is often brown or pale yellow. It is commonly found between the teeth, along the gumline, on the chewing surfaces of the teeth, along the tongue, and below the gumline on the roots of the teeth. The primary mineral in dental plaque is calcium phosphate, also known as hydroxyapatite. The proportion of these minerals in dental plaque is usually higher in calcium than in phosphorous, and the amount of potassium is usually less than both calcium and phosphorous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Calcium > phosphorous > potassium\"}"
