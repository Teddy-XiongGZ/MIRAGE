    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Surface tension is a property of the liquid that allows it to resist an external force. In the context of orthodontic brackets, the material with the highest critical surface tension would be the one that is most resistant to wetting by saliva or other liquids in the mouth. Stainless steel, polycarbonate, ceramic alumina, and titanium are all materials used in orthodontic brackets. Stainless steel and titanium are metals, while polycarbonate and ceramic alumina are non-metals. Non-metals generally have higher critical surface tension than metals. Between polycarbonate and ceramic alumina, ceramic alumina has a higher critical surface tension because it is more hydrophilic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Ceramic alumina\"}"
