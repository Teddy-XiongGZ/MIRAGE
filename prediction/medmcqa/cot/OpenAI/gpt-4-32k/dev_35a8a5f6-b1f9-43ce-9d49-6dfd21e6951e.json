    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biocompatibility tests are used to determine if a material is compatible with living tissue. The Buehler test, Implantation test, and Sensitization test are all tests used to determine biocompatibility. The Buehler test is used to determine if a material causes skin irritation. The Implantation test is used to determine if a material causes any adverse reactions when implanted into the body. The Sensitization test is used to determine if a material causes an allergic reaction. However, the Ames test is a test used to determine the mutagenic potential of a substance, not its biocompatibility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Ame's test\"}"
