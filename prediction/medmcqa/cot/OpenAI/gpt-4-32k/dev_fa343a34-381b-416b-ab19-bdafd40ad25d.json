    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular first molar is a tooth located in the lower jaw. It has two roots, one mesial and one distal. The distal root is more curved and narrower than the mesial root. During post preparation, the dentist drills into the root to place a post that will support a crown. The distal canal is more prone to perforation due to its curvature and narrowness. The most common site of perforation is the distal surface because it is the thinnest part of the root.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Distal surface\"}"
