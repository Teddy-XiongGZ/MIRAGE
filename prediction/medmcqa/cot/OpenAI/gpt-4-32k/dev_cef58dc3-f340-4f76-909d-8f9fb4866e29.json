    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pivot shift test is a specific test used to evaluate the stability of the knee. It is particularly useful in identifying injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL is one of the four main ligaments in the knee and it prevents the tibia from sliding out in front of the femur. A positive pivot shift test indicates that there is an abnormal forward movement of the tibia on the femur, which is typically due to an injury to the ACL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
