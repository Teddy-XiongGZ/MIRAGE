    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The alveolar bone is part of the jaw bone that contains the tooth sockets and surrounds the teeth's roots. It is involved in holding the teeth in place. The fibres attached to the alveolar bone include the horizontal, oblique, and apical fibres. The transseptal fibres, on the other hand, are not attached to the alveolar bone. Instead, they run from the cementum near the top of one tooth, over the crest of the alveolar bone, to a similar location on the adjacent tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
