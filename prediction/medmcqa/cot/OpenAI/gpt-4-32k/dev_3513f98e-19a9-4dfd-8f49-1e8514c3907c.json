    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formula for urea clearance is C = U x V/P. In this formula, C stands for clearance, V stands for urine volume, and P stands for plasma concentration. Therefore, U should stand for the concentration of urea in the urine. The unit for this concentration is typically mg/ml, not g/24 hour, osmolarity, or volume per minute.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
