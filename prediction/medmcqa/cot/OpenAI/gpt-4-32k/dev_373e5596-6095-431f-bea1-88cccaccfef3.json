    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fetal alcohol syndrome is a condition in a child that results from alcohol exposure during the mother's pregnancy. It causes brain damage and growth problems. The problems caused by fetal alcohol syndrome vary from child to child, but defects caused by fetal alcohol syndrome include: intellectual disability, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Physical defects include a small head (microcephaly), a smooth ridge between the upper lip and nose, small and wide-set eyes, a very thin upper lip, or other abnormal facial features. Holoprosencephaly is a condition where the brain doesn't properly divide into the right and left hemispheres, which can be a result of fetal alcohol syndrome. Thinning of the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerve fibers that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain, can also be a result of fetal alcohol syndrome. However, macrocephaly, which is an abnormally large head, is not typically associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
