    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lidocaine is a class 1b antiarrhythmic drug. It works by blocking the fast voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels in the myocardial cell. This reduces the rate of depolarization, decreases automaticity, and increases the cell's threshold for excitation. Therefore, it does not increase A-V conduction or cardiac conduction velocity, nor does it increase spontaneous pacemaker activity. Instead, it decreases cardiac excitability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
