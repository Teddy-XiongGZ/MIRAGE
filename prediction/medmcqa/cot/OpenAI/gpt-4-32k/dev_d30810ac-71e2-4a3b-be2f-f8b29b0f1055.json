    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Galeazzi's fracture dislocation is a fracture of the radius with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. It typically involves a fracture of the radial shaft, along with a disruption of the distal radioulnar joint. This disruption is often due to a tear in the interosseous membrane and the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), which are key structures in the stability of this joint. Therefore, the correct answer should involve a radial shaft fracture and a tear in both the interosseous membrane and the TFCC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
