    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diagnodent is a device used in dentistry to detect caries. It does not use sound waves or visible light, and it is not based on nanotechnology. Instead, it uses laser fluorescence to detect caries. The laser light is absorbed by the tooth and then re-emitted. The device measures the intensity of this re-emitted light, which is higher in areas of the tooth that have caries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. LASER\"}"
