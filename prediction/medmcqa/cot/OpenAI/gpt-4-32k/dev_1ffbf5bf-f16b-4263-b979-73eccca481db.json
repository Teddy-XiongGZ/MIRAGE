    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular incisors are the teeth located in the lower front of the mouth. They typically have one root canal, but in some cases, they can have two. The incidence of two canals in mandibular incisors is not very common. It's definitely not as high as 20 - 41%, and it's also not as common as 12 - 20%. The incidence is relatively low, but it's not extremely rare, so it's not less than 3%. Therefore, the incidence of two canals in mandibular incisors is likely between 3 - 12%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
