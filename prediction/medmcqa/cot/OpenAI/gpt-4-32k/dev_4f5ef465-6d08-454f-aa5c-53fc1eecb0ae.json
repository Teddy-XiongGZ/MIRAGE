    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pharyngeal arches are embryological structures that give rise to many structures in the head and neck. The tensor tympani, derived from the first pharyngeal arch, is involved in dampening the sounds produced by chewing. The palatine tensor, also derived from the first pharyngeal arch, is involved in opening the Eustachian tube during swallowing or yawning. The orbicularis oculi, derived from the second pharyngeal arch, is involved in closing the eyelids. However, the levator palpebrae superioris, which elevates the upper eyelid, is not derived from the pharyngeal arches. It is derived from the mesoderm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Levator palpebrae superioris\"}"
