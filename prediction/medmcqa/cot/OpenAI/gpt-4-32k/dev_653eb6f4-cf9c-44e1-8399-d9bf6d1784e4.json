    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fusion temperature of an alloy is the temperature at which it becomes a liquid from a solid state. The fusion temperature of an alloy can be reduced by adding a metal with a lower melting point. Among the options given, platinum and gold have higher melting points than dental gold casting alloys, so they would not reduce the fusion temperature. Silver and copper have lower melting points, but copper is known to significantly reduce the fusion temperature of gold alloys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Copper\"}"
