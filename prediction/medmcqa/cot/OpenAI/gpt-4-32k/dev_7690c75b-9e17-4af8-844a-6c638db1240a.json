    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Core body temperature is best measured at a site that reflects the temperature of the blood perfusing the hypothalamus, which is the body's thermostat. The pulmonary artery is the most reliable site to measure core temperature during general anesthesia because it reflects the mixed venous blood temperature, which is the best indicator of core temperature. The other options, while they can be used to measure body temperature, are not as accurate as the pulmonary artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
