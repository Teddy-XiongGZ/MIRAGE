    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lingually placed mandibular posteriors refer to the back teeth in the lower jaw being positioned towards the tongue. This can cause a number of issues. Gagging can occur as the tongue may push the teeth towards the back of the throat. Speech difficulties can arise as the tongue's movement can be restricted, affecting pronunciation. Excessive pressure on the ridge can occur as the teeth are not in their natural position. However, tongue interference is not an exception, but rather a direct consequence of the teeth being placed lingually. The tongue would naturally interfere with the teeth in this position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Tongue interference\" }"
