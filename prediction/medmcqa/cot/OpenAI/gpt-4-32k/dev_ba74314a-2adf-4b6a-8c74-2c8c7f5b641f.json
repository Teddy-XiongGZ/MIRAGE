    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child is showing symptoms of gastroenteritis, which is often caused by a viral or bacterial infection and results in diarrhea and vomiting. The main risk with these symptoms is dehydration. However, the child is still able to drink fluids, which indicates that he is not severely dehydrated. Therefore, intravenous fluids (option A and C) are not necessary at this stage. Plain water (option D) is not recommended as it does not contain the necessary electrolytes lost during diarrhea and vomiting. Oral rehydration therapy (option B) is the best choice as it not only replenishes lost fluids but also provides necessary electrolytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
