    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resting membrane potential is a balance of the equilibrium potentials of all ions that the membrane is permeable to. In this case, it's a balance of ions X, Y, and Z. If the permeability of ion Z is blocked, the membrane potential will now be determined by the equilibrium potentials of ions X and Y only. Since we don't know the equilibrium potential of ion Z, we can't predict the exact change. However, we can say that the membrane potential will change, because the balance of ions contributing to it has changed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. No change\"}"
