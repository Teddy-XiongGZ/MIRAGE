    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a term that describes the number of deaths under 1 year of age per 1000 live births per year. This is not child mortality rate, as that typically refers to children under the age of 5. It's also not child morbidity rate, which refers to the prevalence of disease among children. Life expectancy rate is a measure of the average lifespan of an individual in a population. Therefore, the correct term is infant mortality rate, which specifically refers to the number of deaths of infants under 1 year of age per 1000 live births.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
