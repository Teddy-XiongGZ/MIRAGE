    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stainless steel orthodontic wire can be hardened by a process called work hardening or strain hardening. This process involves deforming the metal, such as by bending, which increases the dislocation density within the metal, thereby increasing its hardness and strength. Tempering is a heat treatment technique used to increase the toughness of iron-based alloys, which is not applicable here. Age hardening and precipitation hardening are also not applicable as they involve heat treatment and addition of alloying elements respectively.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Work/ Strain hardening\"}"
