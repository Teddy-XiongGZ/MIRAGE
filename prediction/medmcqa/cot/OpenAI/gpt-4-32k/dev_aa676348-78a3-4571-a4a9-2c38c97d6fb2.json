    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rate of loading refers to the speed at which a force is applied to a material. If the rate of loading is decreased, it means the force is applied more slowly. This can affect the mechanical properties of the material. However, the exact effect can depend on the specific material and the nature of the force. In general, a slower rate of loading can allow the material more time to deform and adjust to the force, which can potentially increase its mechanical properties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increases\"}"
