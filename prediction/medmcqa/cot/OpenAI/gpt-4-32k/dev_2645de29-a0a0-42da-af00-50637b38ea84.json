    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pain sensation from the tooth is transmitted to the brain via nerve fibers. There are different types of nerve fibers, including A delta fibers, C fibers, Beta fibers, and Gamma fibers. A delta fibers are responsible for transmitting sharp, well-defined, fast pain sensations, such as the pain from a toothache. C fibers transmit slow, dull, and poorly localized pain. Beta fibers are associated with touch and pressure, while Gamma fibers are involved in muscle tone and movement. Therefore, the short sharp pain of a tooth would be transmitted to the brain by A delta fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
