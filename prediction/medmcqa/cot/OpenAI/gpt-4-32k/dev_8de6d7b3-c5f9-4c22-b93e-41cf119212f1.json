    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A hygienic pontic is a type of dental prosthesis that is designed to allow easy cleaning of the underlying tissue. The faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of the pontic refers to the size of the pontic from the front (facial) to the back (lingual) in the mouth. The length of the pontic (A) would not primarily determine this dimension. The masticatory force of the patient (B) could influence the overall design of the denture, but it would not primarily determine the faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of the pontic. The position of the opposing contact areas (C) could influence the occlusal relationships, but again, it would not primarily determine the faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of the pontic. The width and crestal position of the edentulous ridge (D), however, would directly influence the faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of the pontic, as the pontic must be designed to fit within the space provided by the edentulous ridge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
