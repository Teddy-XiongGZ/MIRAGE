    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The upper denture falling when the patient opens his mouth wide is not likely due to a thick labial flange, over-extended borders, or a thick disto-buccal flange. These factors could cause discomfort or improper fit, but they wouldn't necessarily cause the denture to fall out when the mouth is opened wide. The most likely cause is a poor peripheral seal. The peripheral seal helps to create suction between the denture and the oral tissues, keeping the denture in place. If this seal is poor or broken, the denture may fall out when the mouth is opened wide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
