    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Caries susceptibility refers to the likelihood of a tooth developing dental caries, also known as tooth decay. The first teeth to erupt in the mouth are usually the most susceptible to caries because they are exposed to the oral environment for a longer period of time. In primary dentition, the first molar is usually the first to erupt, followed by the canines and then the second molars. Therefore, the order of caries susceptibility should be 1st molar > canine > 2nd molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 1st molar>2st molar>canine\"}"
