    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When this happens, bones increase in size, including those of hands, feet, and face. This condition typically affects middle-aged adults. In children who are still growing, too much growth hormone can cause a condition called gigantism rather than acromegaly. This is because their growth plates, or epiphyses, have not yet closed. Once the growth plates close after puberty, the bones can no longer grow in length, but they can still grow in thickness under the stimulation of growth hormone. Therefore, acromegaly occurs after the closure of the epiphyses of long bones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. After closure of epiphyses of long bones\"}"
