    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chronic gingival inflammation, also known as periodontitis, is a common gum disease that results from the long-term accumulation of bacteria in the mouth. The immune system responds to this bacterial invasion by sending various types of white blood cells to the site of infection. Neutrophils, macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and plasma cells are all part of the immune response and play a role in the inflammation process. However, neutrophils are the first line of defense and are primarily involved in acute inflammation, not chronic inflammation. They are short-lived and are not typically present in chronic inflammation where long-lived cells like macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and plasma cells are more prevalent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Neutrophil\"}"
