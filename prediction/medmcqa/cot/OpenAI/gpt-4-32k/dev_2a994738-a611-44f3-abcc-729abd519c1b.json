    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Benzoyl peroxide is a common initiator in the polymerization of acrylic resin. It decomposes to form free radicals, which then initiate the polymerization process. The decomposition of benzoyl peroxide is a temperature-dependent process. At room temperature (around 25\u00b0C), it is stable and does not decompose. The decomposition starts at a higher temperature, typically above 60\u00b0C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 60\u00b0C\"}"
