    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GIC, or Glass Ionomer Cement, is a type of dental cement that is commonly used for restorations. It adheres to the tooth surface through a chemical reaction. The carboxyl group in the polyacrylic acid of GIC reacts with the calcium in the tooth surface, forming a bond. Therefore, the mechanism of adhesion of GIC restoration with tooth surface is by means of the carboxyl group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
