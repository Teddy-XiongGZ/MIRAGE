    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious intestinal disease that primarily affects premature infants. It is staged according to Bell's staging criteria. Stage 1b is characterized by mild systemic illness and nonspecific signs. Stage 2a is characterized by definite signs of NEC but without pneumatosis intestinalis. Stage 2b is characterized by definite signs of NEC with pneumatosis intestinalis. Stage 3a is characterized by severe systemic illness with or without pneumatosis intestinalis. In this case, the baby has pneumatosis intestinalis, which is a characteristic sign of NEC, and this is seen in stage 2b and 3a. However, there is no mention of severe systemic illness, so we can rule out stage 3a.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 2b\"}"
