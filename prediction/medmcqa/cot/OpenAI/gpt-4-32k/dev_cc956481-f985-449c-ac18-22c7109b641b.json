    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Variance and standard deviation are measures of dispersion within a single unit or dataset. Range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. The coefficient of variation, however, is a standardized measure of dispersion and is used to compare the degree of variation from one data series to another, even if the means are drastically different from each other. Therefore, it is the most suitable for measuring variation between two different units.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
