Resection of supracrestal fibers (option B) is a surgical procedure that is not typically the first step in managing a rotated tooth. Exerting a couple on the tooth (option C) is a term used in orthodontics to describe a force system that can cause tooth rotation, but it's not a treatment step. Fixed orthodontic appliances (option D), however, are commonly used to correct tooth alignment issues, including rotation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
