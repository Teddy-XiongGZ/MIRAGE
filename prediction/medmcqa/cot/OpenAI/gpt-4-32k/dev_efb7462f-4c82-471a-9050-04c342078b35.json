    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a structure that projects efferent fibers. Efferent fibers are those that carry impulses away from the central nervous system. The hippocampus, mammillary body, caudate nucleus, and amygdala are all parts of the brain. The hippocampus is primarily involved in memory formation, the mammillary body is involved in memory recall, the caudate nucleus is involved in motor processes, and the amygdala is involved in emotion and memory. Of these, the amygdala is known to project efferent fibers to various parts of the brain, including the hypothalamus and the prefrontal cortex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Amygdala\"}"
