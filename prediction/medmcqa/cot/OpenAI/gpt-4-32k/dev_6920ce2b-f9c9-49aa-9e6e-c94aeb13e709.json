    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pituitary gland influences many endocrine glands in the body. It stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones, the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol, and the ovaries and testes to produce sex hormones. However, the adrenal medulla, parathyroids, and the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas function independently of the pituitary gland. The adrenal medulla produces adrenaline and noradrenaline, the parathyroids produce parathyroid hormone, and the islets of Langerhans produce insulin and glucagon, all without direct stimulation from the pituitary gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
