    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Distraction osteogenesis is a process used to regenerate bone and soft tissue. It involves the gradual separation of two bone segments after an osteotomy. The latent period is the time between the osteotomy and the start of the distraction. In children, this period is typically shorter than in adults due to their faster healing and bone growth rates. However, it's not as short as 0-2 days. It's also not as long as 4-6 weeks. The most appropriate range for the latent period in a child would be 5-7 days.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
