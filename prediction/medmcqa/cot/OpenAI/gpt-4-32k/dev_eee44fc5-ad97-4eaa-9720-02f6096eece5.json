    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Impacted third molars, or wisdom teeth, can cause complications during a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy, a surgery to correct jaw deformities. If the impacted tooth is left in place, it can interfere with the healing process after the surgery. Therefore, it is generally recommended to remove the impacted tooth before the surgery. However, the extraction should be done well in advance of the surgery to allow for proper healing of the extraction site. This is typically recommended to be done 6 months prior to the surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 6 month before surgery\"}"
