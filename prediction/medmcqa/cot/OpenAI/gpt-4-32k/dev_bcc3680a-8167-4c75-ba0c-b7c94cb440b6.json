    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Confounding is a distortion of the association between an exposure and an outcome that occurs when the study groups differ with respect to other factors that influence the outcome. Randomization, matching, and blinding are all methods used to control for confounding. Randomization ensures that each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to any group in a study, which can help to balance confounders across groups. Matching involves pairing participants who have similar characteristics, which can help to control for those characteristics as confounders. Blinding prevents those involved in a study from knowing which participants are in which group, which can help to prevent bias that could confound the results. Random selection, on the other hand, is a method used to select a sample from a population, but it does not control for confounding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
