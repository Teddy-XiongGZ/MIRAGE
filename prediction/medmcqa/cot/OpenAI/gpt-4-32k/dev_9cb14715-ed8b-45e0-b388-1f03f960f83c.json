    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the case of a facial porcelain inlay, the facial surface should be prepared in a way that it converges to the cavity margins. This is because the convergence allows for a better fit of the inlay and ensures that the inlay is securely held in place. A perpendicular or parallel orientation may not provide the same level of security and fit. The depth of the axial wall is not directly related to the orientation of the facial surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
