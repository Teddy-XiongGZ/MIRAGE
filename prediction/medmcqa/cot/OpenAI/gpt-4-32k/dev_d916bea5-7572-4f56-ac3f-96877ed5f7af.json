    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about an extra root on the mesial side of the palate. The term 'mesial' refers to the side of the tooth closer to the midline of the face, while 'palatal' refers to the side of the tooth closer to the palate. Therefore, the term for an extra root on the mesial side of the palate would be 'mesiopalatal'. The prefix 'radix' is Latin for 'root', so the full term would be 'radix mesiopalatalis'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Radix mesiopalatalis\"}"
