    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The genioglossus muscle is primarily responsible for protruding the tongue, not for moving the mandible. The anterior belly of the digastric muscle, mylohyoid, and thyrohyoid are all involved in the movement of the hyoid bone, not the mandible. The masseter muscle is a muscle of mastication and its primary function is to elevate the mandible (close the mouth) and it also helps in protraction (pulling forward) and retraction (pulling back) of the mandible. Therefore, none of the options provided would tend to pull the mandible back following a bilateral mandibular fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
