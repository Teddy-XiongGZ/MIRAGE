    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To evaluate post-operative vision effects after cataract extraction surgery under PCB, we need a method that allows us to monitor all patients who have undergone the procedure. Active surveillance involves actively seeking out information, which is not necessary in this case. Sentinel surveillance involves monitoring a subset of the population, which is also not applicable here. Passive surveillance involves collecting data as it becomes available, but this may not be sufficient to evaluate all post-operative effects. Therefore, the most appropriate method would be a routine checkup of all operated cases, which ensures that all patients are monitored and any post-operative effects are identified and addressed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
