    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A subcondylar fracture is a type of mandibular fracture that occurs in the condylar neck or head, which are parts of the mandible. This type of fracture can cause various symptoms, including pain, swelling, and difficulty opening the mouth (trismus). However, it would not typically cause intraoral bleeding, as this would more likely be associated with a laceration or other soft tissue injury. Bilateral crepitus would suggest a bilateral fracture or other condition affecting both sides of the mandible, which is not indicated in this case. The mandible deviating to the right on protrusion would be consistent with a fracture on the left side, as the uninjured (right) side would be overcompensating during movement. Inability to deviate the mandible to the right would not be expected, as the right side is not injured.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
