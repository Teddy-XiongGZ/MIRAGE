    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gums. It is a non-destructive disease that occurs around the teeth. The most common form of gingivitis, and the most common form of periodontal disease overall, is in response to bacterial biofilms (also called plaque) that is attached to tooth surfaces. Gingivitis does not affect the bone structure, so there would be no bone loss, either vertical or horizontal, and no increase in bone density. Therefore, the radiographic finding would show a normal bone pattern.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Normal bone pattern\"}"
