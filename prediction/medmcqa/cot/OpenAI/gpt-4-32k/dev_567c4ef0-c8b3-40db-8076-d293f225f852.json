    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tricuspid Atresia is a type of congenital heart disease where the tricuspid valve is missing or abnormally developed. This leads to right ventricular hypoplasia (choice B) because the blood cannot flow into it properly. Due to the lack of blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary vascularity is diminished (choice C). The blood flow changes also cause a left axis deviation on EKG (choice A). However, splitting of S2 (choice D) is not a characteristic feature of Tricuspid Atresia. The second heart sound (S2) is produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. In Tricuspid Atresia, the blood flow through these valves is altered, but it does not cause a splitting of S2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
