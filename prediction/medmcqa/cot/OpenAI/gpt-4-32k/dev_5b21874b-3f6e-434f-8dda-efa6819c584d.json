    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a specialized connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue helps the tooth withstand the naturally substantial forces imposed during chewing. When excessive forces of occlusion occur within physiological limits, the PDL adapts to these forces by increasing its width to distribute the forces over a larger area, thereby protecting the tooth and alveolar bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
