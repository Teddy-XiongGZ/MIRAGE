    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MHC antigens, also known as major histocompatibility complex antigens, are proteins found on the surface of most cells. They play a crucial role in the immune system's recognition of self and non-self cells. Neutrophils and monocytes, being white blood cells, definitely have MHC antigens as they are involved in immune responses. Platelets, although they are not cells but fragments of cells, they do have MHC antigens. Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, however, do not have MHC antigens because they lose their nucleus and other organelles during maturation, which includes the machinery needed to produce these proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Erythrocyte\"}"
