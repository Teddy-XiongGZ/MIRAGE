    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein produced by the fetus. It is typically used as a screening tool for neural tube defects and abdominal wall defects in the fetus. In Down's syndrome, the AFP levels are usually lower than normal. Spina bifida occulta is a mild form of spina bifida where there is a small gap in the spine, but it does not usually cause an increase in AFP levels. Omphalocele and gastroschisis are both abdominal wall defects. However, gastroschisis is associated with higher levels of AFP because the abdominal contents are exposed to the amniotic fluid, leading to higher absorption of AFP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Gastroschisis\"}"
