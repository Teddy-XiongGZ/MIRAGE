    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DIC, or Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, is a condition characterized by systemic activation of blood clotting, which results in the formation and deposition of fibrin clots in the bloodstream. This can lead to multiple organ damage. In DIC, fibrinogen levels are typically decreased due to excessive consumption (choice A). Thrombocytopenia, or low platelet count, is also a common finding in DIC due to the consumption of platelets in the clotting process (choice B). The PT, or Prothrombin Time, is usually elevated in DIC because the clotting factors are being used up, leading to a longer time for blood to clot (choice D). However, the APTT, or Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time, is not typically normal in DIC. It is usually prolonged due to the consumption of clotting factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
