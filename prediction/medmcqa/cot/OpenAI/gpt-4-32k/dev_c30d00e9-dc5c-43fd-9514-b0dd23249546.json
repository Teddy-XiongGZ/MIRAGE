    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is a serious infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Roth spots, which are retinal hemorrhages with white or pale centers, and Osler's nodes, which are tender nodules on the pads of the fingers and toes, are both classic signs of infective endocarditis. Positive blood cultures are also a common finding in infective endocarditis as the bacteria or fungi causing the infection can often be found in the blood. Aschoff nodules, however, are a feature of rheumatic fever, not infective endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
