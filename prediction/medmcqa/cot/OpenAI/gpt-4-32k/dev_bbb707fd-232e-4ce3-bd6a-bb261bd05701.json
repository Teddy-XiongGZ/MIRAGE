    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute poliomyelitis is a viral disease that can affect nerves and can lead to partial or full paralysis. The most severe form, paralytic poliomyelitis, can cause difficulty breathing, swallowing, and even death. The intercostal muscles, which are located between the ribs, are involved in the process of breathing. If these muscles are paralyzed, it can lead to respiratory failure. Convulsion and cardiac arrest are not typically associated with poliomyelitis. Therefore, the most common cause of death in acute poliomyelitis is likely due to respiratory failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Respiratory failure\"}"
