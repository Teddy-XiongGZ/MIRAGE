    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To preserve blood for transfusion, we need to prevent it from clotting. Option A, diluting with saline, would not prevent clotting. Option C, adding calcium chloride, would actually promote clotting, as calcium is a necessary factor in the clotting cascade. Option D, adding fibrinogen, would also promote clotting, as fibrinogen is converted to fibrin in the clotting process. Option B, adding sodium citrate, is the correct choice. Sodium citrate binds to calcium in the blood, preventing it from participating in the clotting cascade and thus preventing clotting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
