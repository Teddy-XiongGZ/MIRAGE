    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children can lead to several complications. Compartment syndrome, which is a serious condition that involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment, can occur due to swelling or bleeding within the muscles. Myositis ossificans, which is the formation of bone tissue inside muscle tissue after a traumatic injury, can also occur. Malunion, which is the healing of a bone in an incorrect position, can also occur. However, non-union, which is the failure of a fracture to heal, is very rare in children because their bones are still growing and have a good blood supply, which aids in healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Non-Union\"}"
