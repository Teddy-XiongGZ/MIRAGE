    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Base metal alloys are often cleaned by a process called sandblasting. This process involves blasting the surface of the metal with small particles to remove impurities and create a smooth surface. The other options, such as using warm HCl, cold HF, or cold H2SO4, are not typically used for cleaning base metal alloys as they can cause damage to the metal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
