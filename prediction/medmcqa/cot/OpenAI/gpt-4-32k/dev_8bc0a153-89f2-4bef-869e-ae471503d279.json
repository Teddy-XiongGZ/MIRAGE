    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chuna, also known as lime or calcium hydroxide, is a strong alkali and can cause severe ocular burns when it comes into contact with the eyes. The immediate management of such a case would involve steps to neutralize the alkali and minimize damage. Irrigation of both eyes with copious amounts of normal saline would help to dilute and wash out the alkali. Thorough slit-lamp examination on presentation would help to assess the extent of the injury. Removal of chuna particles by double eversion of upper eyelids would help to ensure that no residual alkali remains in the eye. However, frequent sodium citrate drops would not be part of the immediate management. Sodium citrate is used as a buffer in certain eye drops, but it is not typically used in the immediate management of alkali burns to the eye.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
