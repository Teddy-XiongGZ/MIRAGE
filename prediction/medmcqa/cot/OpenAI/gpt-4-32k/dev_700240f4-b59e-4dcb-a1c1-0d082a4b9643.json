    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The standard deviation (SD) is a measure of how spread out numbers are. In a normal distribution, about 68% of values drawn from the population will lie within one standard deviation away from the mean, about 95% within two standard deviations, and about 99.73% lie within three standard deviations. Therefore, 99.73% variation involves three standard deviations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
