    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most suitable surgery for a setback of the mandible that is greater than 10 mm. Sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) is a common procedure used for mandibular advancement or setback. However, it is typically used for movements of less than 10 mm. Vertical ramus osteotomy is also used for mandibular setbacks, but it is less commonly used than SSRO and is also typically used for smaller movements. Subapical osteotomy is used for correcting dentoalveolar deformities and not for large mandibular setbacks. Body osteotomy with extraction of premolars is used for larger mandibular setbacks, and it allows for greater than 10 mm of movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
