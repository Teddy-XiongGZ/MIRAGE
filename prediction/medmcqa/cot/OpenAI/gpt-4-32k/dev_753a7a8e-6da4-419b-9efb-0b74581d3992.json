    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tubercular meningitis is a severe form of tuberculosis that affects the meninges, which cover the brain and spinal cord. If a patient's condition deteriorates despite regular intake of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), it's crucial to investigate the cause. An MRI or NCCT (Non-Contrast Computed Tomography) can help identify any changes in the brain that might explain the deterioration. A CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) examination can help identify any changes in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, which could indicate an infection or other problem. Liver function tests, while important in monitoring the side effects of ATT, are not typically required as an emergency investigation in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Liver function tests\"}"
