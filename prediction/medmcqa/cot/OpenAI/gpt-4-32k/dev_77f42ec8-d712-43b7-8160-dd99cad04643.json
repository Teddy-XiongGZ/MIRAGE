    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intrusion of a permanent tooth in a child is a serious dental injury. The treatment depends on the severity of the intrusion. If the intrusion is severe, orthodontic treatment might be necessary. However, in most cases, the tooth can be repositioned and splinted, allowing for the natural healing process to take place. Doing nothing is not an option as it can lead to complications such as infection or damage to the permanent tooth. Allowing the tooth to erupt on its own is not a reliable option either, as it might not happen or it might happen in a wrong position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Put tooth in its place and splint it\"}"
