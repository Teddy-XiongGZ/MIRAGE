    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about enzyme kinetics. The initial condition is that the substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme, which means the reaction is at its maximum rate (Vmax). When the enzyme concentration is reduced to 1/3, the reaction rate will also be reduced to 1/3 because the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration. However, the substrate concentration is doubled, which means the reaction rate will be increased. But since the substrate concentration is already much higher than the Km, the reaction is still at Vmax and the increase in substrate concentration will not affect the reaction rate. Therefore, the overall reaction rate is reduced to 1/3 of the original rate. To produce the same amount of product, it will take 3 times longer than the original time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 27 minutes\"}"
