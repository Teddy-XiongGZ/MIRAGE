    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parotid gland is innervated by the facial nerve, which is responsible for facial expressions. However, the sensation of the face, including the area where one would shave, is provided by the trigeminal nerve. The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve, but it primarily provides sensation to the lower jaw, not the cheek area where one would typically shave. The auriculotemporal nerve is also a branch of the trigeminal nerve and provides sensation to the temple and ear area. The greater auricular nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus, provides sensation to the area over the parotid gland and the ear, which is the area that would be numb post parotidectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Greater auricular\"}"
