    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, also known as hyperchloremic acidosis, is a type of metabolic acidosis characterized by a normal anion gap (12 \u00b1 2 mEq/L). It is most commonly due to a loss of bicarbonate (HCO3), which is usually replaced by chloride (Cl-) ions; hence the term hyperchloremic acidosis. This can occur in conditions such as diarrhea, where there is a significant loss of bicarbonate, and renal tubular acidosis (proximal and distal). Severe pancreatitis can also lead to metabolic acidosis, but it is usually a high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of organic acids. Salicylate poisoning, on the other hand, can cause both a respiratory alkalosis (due to stimulation of the respiratory center) and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (due to the accumulation of organic acids).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Salicylates poisoning\"}"
