    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stage-I cancer is the earliest stage of cancer, where the tumor is small and hasn't spread. In the case of laryngeal cancer, the treatment of choice is usually radiotherapy. This is because it is less invasive than surgery and can often cure early-stage laryngeal cancer while preserving the function of the larynx. Chemotherapy is typically used in combination with radiotherapy for more advanced stages of cancer. Radical surgery and surgery followed by radiotherapy are usually reserved for cases where the cancer is more advanced or if the patient doesn't respond to radiotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
