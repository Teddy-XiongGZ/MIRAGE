    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontal disease is a disease that affects the gums and other structures supporting the teeth. Therefore, to determine the presence of periodontal disease, an index that measures the health of these structures would be used. The Gingival index (G.I.) measures the severity of gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums, but not necessarily periodontal disease. The Plaque index (P.I.) measures the amount of dental plaque, which can lead to periodontal disease, but it doesn't measure the disease itself. The Periodontal index (P.I), however, measures the severity of periodontal disease, including both the inflammation of the gums and the loss of tooth support.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Periodontal index (P.I)\"}"
