    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium valproate is known to have teratogenic effects and is not recommended during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. However, the patient is already 4 months pregnant, which means she is in her second trimester. Abruptly stopping the medication can lead to withdrawal symptoms and seizures, which can be harmful to both the mother and the fetus. Therefore, it would be best to switch to a safer anti-epileptic drug. Lamotrigine is considered safer during pregnancy, but it should be started at a low dose and gradually increased to avoid side effects. Carbamazepine is also an option, but it has a higher risk of causing birth defects compared to lamotrigine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Immediately taper off valproate and start lamotrigine\"}"
