    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Disto-angular impaction of the mandibular 3rd molar, also known as the wisdom tooth, is a common dental condition where the tooth is angled towards the rear of the mouth. When this tooth is extracted, it can lead to several complications. Slippage in the lingual pouch is not a common complication of this procedure. A fracture (#) of the ramus of the mandible is possible, but it's not the most common complication. Excessive hemorrhage can occur, but again, it's not the most common complication. The most common complication of wisdom tooth extraction is a dry socket, which occurs when the blood clot that normally forms after extraction is dislodged or dissolves, exposing the bone and nerves.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
