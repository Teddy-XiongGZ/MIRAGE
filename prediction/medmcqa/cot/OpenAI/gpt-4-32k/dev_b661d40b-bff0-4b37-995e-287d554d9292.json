    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malocclusion in an 8-year-old child is a common dental issue. At this age, the child is still in the mixed dentition stage, meaning they have both primary (baby) and permanent teeth. The canine usually erupts around age 11-12. Therefore, it's often recommended to wait until all the permanent teeth have erupted before starting orthodontic treatment. This is because the final positions of the permanent teeth can't be accurately predicted until they have all erupted. Immediate intervention or extraction is usually not recommended unless there is a severe problem that is causing pain or affecting the child's ability to eat. Serial extraction is a treatment method that involves the planned extraction of certain deciduous teeth and later specific permanent teeth in an orderly sequence and predetermined pattern to guide the erupting permanent teeth into a more favorable position. However, this method is usually reserved for cases of severe crowding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Wait and watch till canine erupts\"}"
