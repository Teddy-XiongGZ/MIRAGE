    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Terfenadine is an antihistamine used to treat allergic conditions. It is known to cause QT prolongation, which can lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias. This effect can be potentiated by certain drugs, including some antibiotics. Among the options given, erythromycin is known to inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, leading to increased plasma levels of the drug and thus increasing the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmias.
