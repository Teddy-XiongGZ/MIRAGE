    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Optic atrophy is a condition that affects the optic nerve, which carries impulses from the eye to the brain. It's typically seen in conditions that cause damage to or put pressure on the optic nerve. Retinitis pigmentosa (A) is a group of rare, genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina, which can lead to optic atrophy. Methanol poisoning (B) can cause serious health problems, including optic nerve damage, leading to optic atrophy. Central retinal artery occlusion (C) is a blockage of the artery that carries oxygen to the retina, which can cause optic nerve damage and result in optic atrophy. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (D) is a type of condition that causes abnormal blood vessels and hemorrhaging in the eye, but it does not typically cause optic atrophy as it primarily affects the choroid and not the optic nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
