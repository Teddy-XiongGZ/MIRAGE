    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A parasymphysial fracture refers to a fracture in the area of the mandible near the midline. The treatment plan for such a fracture depends on the severity and location of the fracture. Intermaxillary fixation (IMF) is a common treatment for mandibular fractures, which involves wiring the upper and lower jaws together to allow the bone to heal. However, the duration of IMF can vary. A compression plate is not always necessary, it depends on the severity of the fracture. Non-union is a potential complication of any fracture, but it does not necessarily occur if a reconstruction plate is not given. Therefore, the best treatment plan would be determined by the specifics of the fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. IMF for 3 weeks\"}"
