    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a statistical test to compare the outcomes of postpartum depression in mothers giving birth to male versus female children. The Edinburgh depression scale (EPDS) is a continuous variable, and we are comparing two independent groups (mothers of males vs mothers of females). Therefore, we need a test that compares the means of two independent groups. The Student's t-test is used for comparing the means of two independent groups, while the paired t-test is used for comparing the means of the same group at two different times. The Chi-square test is used for categorical data, and Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to measure the strength and direction of association between two continuous variables.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Student's t-test\"}"
