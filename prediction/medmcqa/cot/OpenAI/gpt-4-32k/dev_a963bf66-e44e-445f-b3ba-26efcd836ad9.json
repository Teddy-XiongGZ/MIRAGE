    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resuscitation is a complex process that involves multiple factors. Central Venous Pressure (CVP) can be a good guide, but it is invasive and not always available. Blood pressure is also important, but it can be maintained even in the face of inadequate perfusion. Saturation of Oxygen is important, but it doesn't give a complete picture of the patient's status. Urine output is a good guide because it is a measure of end organ perfusion, particularly to the kidneys. If the kidneys are getting enough blood flow to produce urine, it is a good sign that other vital organs are also being adequately perfused.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Urine output\"}"
