    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A. The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is actually higher than that of the fluid entering it, due to the filtration of water and small solutes out of the capillaries, leaving behind larger proteins which increase the oncotic pressure. B. Glucose concentration in the capillaries is indeed the same as that in glomerular filtrate, as glucose is freely filtered at the glomerulus. C. Constriction of afferent arteriole does decrease the blood flow to the glomerulus, as it reduces the amount of blood that can enter the glomerulus. D. Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of the fluid entering it, as red blood cells are not filtered into the glomerular filtrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
