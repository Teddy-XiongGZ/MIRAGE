    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children. The best diagnostic investigation should be non-invasive, safe, and highly accurate. MRI is highly accurate but it's time-consuming and may require sedation in children. CECT (Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography) is also accurate but it exposes children to radiation. X-ray is not specific for appendicitis. USG (Ultrasound) is non-invasive, does not expose children to radiation, and is highly accurate in experienced hands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
