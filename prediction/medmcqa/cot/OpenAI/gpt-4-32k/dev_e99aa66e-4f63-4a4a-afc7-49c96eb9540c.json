    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of a fall and vomiting near an alcohol shop, which could suggest alcohol intoxication. However, he is awake with open eyes and has retrograde amnesia, which is not typically associated with drunkenness. Retrograde amnesia is a loss of memory-access to events that occurred before an injury, which suggests a head injury. Among the options, a concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury that is often caused by a blow to the head or body, a fall, or another injury that jars or shakes the brain inside the skull, potentially causing physical damage to the brain that can result in temporary or permanent cognitive effects. Diffuse axonal injury is a severe form of traumatic brain injury, but it usually results in unconsciousness or persistent vegetative state, which is not the case here. Cerebral venous thrombosis is a blood clot in the brain's venous sinuses, which would not typically result in retrograde amnesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Concussion\"}"
