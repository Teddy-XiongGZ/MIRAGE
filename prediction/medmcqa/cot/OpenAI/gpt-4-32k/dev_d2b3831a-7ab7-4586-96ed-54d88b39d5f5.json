    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chlortetracycline is a type of antibiotic that belongs to the tetracycline class. The primary mechanism of action of tetracyclines involves the inhibition of protein synthesis in bacteria. They do this by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, which prevents the attachment of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the RNA-ribosome complex. This prevents the addition of new amino acids to the growing peptide chain, thus inhibiting protein synthesis. They do not interfere with metabolism, inhibit cell wall formation, or interfere with DNA function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Inhibition of protein synthesis\"}"
