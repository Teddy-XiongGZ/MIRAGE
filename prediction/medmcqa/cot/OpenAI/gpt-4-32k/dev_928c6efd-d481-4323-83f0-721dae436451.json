    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cholinomimetics are drugs that mimic the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. They are used in various conditions. In glaucoma, they increase the outflow of aqueous humor, thus reducing intraocular pressure (option B). In myasthenia gravis, they enhance neuromuscular transmission by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction (option C). In post-surgical atony or ileus, they stimulate smooth muscle contraction and promote gastrointestinal motility (option D). However, in bradycardia, which is a slow heart rate, cholinomimetics are not used because they would further slow the heart rate by mimicking the action of acetylcholine, which slows heart rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
