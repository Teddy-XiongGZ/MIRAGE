    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sella turcica is a depression in the sphenoid bone at the base of the human skull. The pons is a part of the brainstem that lies beneath the brain itself, so it cannot be above the sella turcica. The frontal sinus is located in the frontal bone of the skull, which is above the sphenoid bone, so the sella turcica cannot be above it. The foramen ovale is a hole in the sphenoid bone, but it is not located above the sella turcica. The sphenoidal sinus is a set of two cavities located within the body of the sphenoid bone, beneath the sella turcica.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sphenoidal sinus\"}"
