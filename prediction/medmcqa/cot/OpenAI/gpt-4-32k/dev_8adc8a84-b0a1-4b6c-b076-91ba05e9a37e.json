These tracts are composed of both afferent (incoming) and efferent (outgoing) fibers. The efferent tracts, which carry information from the cerebellum to other parts of the brain, originate from the deep cerebellar nuclei, not the Purkinje cells, cerebellar cortex, or vermis of the cerebellum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
