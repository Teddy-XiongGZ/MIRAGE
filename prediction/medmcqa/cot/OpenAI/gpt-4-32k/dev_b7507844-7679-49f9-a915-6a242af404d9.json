    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The behavior management technique described in the question involves a threat of removing something (the parents) to stop an undesired behavior (crying). This is not omission, as omission involves removing a positive stimulus when undesired behavior occurs. It's also not positive reinforcement, which involves adding a positive stimulus to encourage a behavior. Modelling involves demonstrating the desired behavior for the child to imitate, which is not the case here. Therefore, the technique described is negative reinforcement, which involves removing an unpleasant stimulus when the desired behavior is performed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Negative reinforcement\"}"
