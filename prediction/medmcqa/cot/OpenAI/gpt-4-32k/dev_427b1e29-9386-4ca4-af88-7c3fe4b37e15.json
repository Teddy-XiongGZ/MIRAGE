    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) is a complex structure, and its internal derangement can involve soft tissues like the articular disc, ligaments, and muscles, as well as hard tissues like the mandibular condyle. A panoramic view can provide a general overview of the bony structures, but it may not provide detailed information about the soft tissues or small fractures. An MRI can provide detailed images of both soft and hard tissues, making it a good choice for diagnosing internal derangements of the TMJ. A CT scan can provide detailed images of the bony structures, but it is not as good as an MRI at imaging soft tissues. Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure that can provide a direct view of the joint, but it is invasive and usually reserved for treatment rather than diagnosis. A bone scan can detect bone diseases and injuries, but it may not provide detailed images of the TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. MRI\"}"
