    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mean is the average of all the numbers in a set, so if one of the numbers is mistakenly entered as higher than it actually is, the mean will increase. The median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. If the number of observations is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. In this case, we have 10 observations, so the median is the average of the 5th and 6th observations. If the highest number (58) is mistakenly entered as 85, it will still be the highest number and will not affect the position of the middle numbers, so the median will not change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased mean. no change in median\"}"
