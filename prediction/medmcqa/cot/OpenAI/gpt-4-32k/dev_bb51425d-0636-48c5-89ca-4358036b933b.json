    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple firings of the opaque layer of dental porcelain can lead to changes in its properties. It won't necessarily make it smoother or more opaque, as the firing process is used to harden the porcelain, not change its texture or opacity. It also won't make it too glazed, as glazing is a separate process that involves applying a layer of glaze and then firing it. However, multiple firings can cause stress in the material, leading to cracks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Crack\"}"
