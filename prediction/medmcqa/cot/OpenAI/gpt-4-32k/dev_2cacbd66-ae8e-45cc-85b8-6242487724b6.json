    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The calcification stage of tooth development is when the tooth begins to harden and take shape. Any disturbances during this stage would affect the structure of the tooth. Peg laterals, microdontia, and supernumerary tooth are all conditions that affect the size and number of teeth, not their structure. Interglobular dentin, on the other hand, is a condition that affects the structure of the tooth, specifically the dentin, which is the layer beneath the enamel. This condition is characterized by areas of dentin that have not fully calcified, which would be consistent with a disturbance during the calcification stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
