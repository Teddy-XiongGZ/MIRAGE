    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genu valgum, also known as 'knock-knees', is a condition where the knees angle in and touch each other when the legs are straightened. The child is 4 years old and the condition is painless, which makes trauma to the epiphysis less likely. Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C, which primarily affects the gums and skin, not the bones. Congenital anomalies are usually present at birth and would likely have been diagnosed earlier. Rickets, on the other hand, is a skeletal disorder that's caused by a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. It can lead to softening and weakening of the bones, causing deformities like genu valgum. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Rickets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
