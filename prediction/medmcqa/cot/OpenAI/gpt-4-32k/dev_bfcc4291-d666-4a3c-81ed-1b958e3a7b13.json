    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A 'cut back' incision is a surgical technique used in flap surgery. It refers to the incision made on a laterally displaced flap. The term 'mesial' refers to a direction towards the midline of the body, while 'distal' refers to a direction away from the midline. The 'donor site' is the area from which the flap is taken, while the 'recipient site' is the area where the flap is transplanted. In the context of a 'cut back' incision, the cut is made away from the donor site and towards the recipient site. Therefore, the cut is distal and towards the recipient site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Distal cut toward the recipient site\"}"
