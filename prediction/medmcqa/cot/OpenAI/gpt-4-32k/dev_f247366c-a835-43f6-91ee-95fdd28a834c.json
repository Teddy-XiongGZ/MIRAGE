    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about the management of a patient with stage T1a gallbladder cancer. Stage T1a gallbladder cancer is confined to the innermost layer of the gallbladder, the lamina propria. In such cases, simple cholecystectomy is usually sufficient as the cancer is very early stage and has not spread to other layers or nearby lymph nodes. Conservative and follow up is not appropriate as it does not address the cancer. Extended cholecystectomy and radiotherapy are more aggressive treatments usually reserved for more advanced stages of gallbladder cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Simple cholecystectomy\"}"
