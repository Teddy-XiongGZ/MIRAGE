    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GDM, or Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, is a condition that develops during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood sugar levels. Obesity (option B) is a risk factor for GDM, as excess body fat can increase resistance to insulin. Hypertension (option C) can also be associated with GDM, as high blood pressure can be a complication of diabetes. Macrosomia (option D), or a larger-than-normal baby, can be a result of GDM, as excess glucose in the mother's bloodstream can cross the placenta, causing the baby to grow too large. However, a past history of fetal abnormality (option A) is not directly associated with GDM. While certain fetal abnormalities can be associated with maternal diabetes, a past history of such abnormalities does not increase the risk of GDM.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
