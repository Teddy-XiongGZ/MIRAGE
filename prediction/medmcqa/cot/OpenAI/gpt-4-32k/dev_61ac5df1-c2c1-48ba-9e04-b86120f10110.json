    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation affects all three germ layers, which are ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. A teratoid cyst is a type of teratoma, a tumor that is made up of several different types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, or bone. Teratomas are derived from pluripotent cells, which are often derived from germ cells. Therefore, a teratoid cyst would be affected by radiation. Dermoid cysts are also a type of teratoma, so they would also be affected by radiation. Thyroglossal cysts are not derived from all three germ layers, they are remnants of the thyroglossal duct, an embryonic structure, so they would not be affected by radiation in the same way. Branchial cysts are also not derived from all three germ layers, they are remnants of the branchial apparatus, so they would not be affected by radiation in the same way.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Teratoid cyst\"}"
