    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaplerotic reactions are those that form intermediates of a metabolic pathway. In the context of the citric acid cycle, anaplerotic reactions replenish the cycle's intermediates. Pyruvate to oxaloacetate is an anaplerotic reaction because oxaloacetate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. The other reactions listed do not produce intermediates of the citric acid cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
