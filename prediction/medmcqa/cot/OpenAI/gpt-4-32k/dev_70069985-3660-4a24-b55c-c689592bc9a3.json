    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentinal fluid permeability refers to the ability of substances to pass through the dentin, the hard tissue that makes up most of the tooth. This permeability is influenced by several factors. Temperature variation can affect the fluidity of the dentinal fluid, thus affecting its permeability. Pressure gradient across the dentinal tubule can also affect the flow of the fluid, and thus its permeability. Increased viscosity of the dentinal fluid can make it more difficult for substances to pass through, thus reducing its permeability. However, the rate of removal of substances by blood vessels is not directly related to the permeability of the dentinal fluid. This process is more related to the body's overall metabolic rate and the efficiency of the circulatory system, rather than the specific properties of the dentinal fluid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
