    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cast cobalt alloys are known for their high modulus of elasticity, which is indeed twice that of gold alloys, so option A is true. They are also more rigid than gold alloys, making option B true as well. The proportional limit of cobalt alloys is higher than that of gold alloys, so option D is false. The only remaining option is C, which states that cobalt alloys have higher ductility than gold alloys. However, gold alloys are generally more ductile than cobalt alloys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
