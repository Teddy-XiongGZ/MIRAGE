    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"EPT, or Electric Pulp Testing, is a method used to assess the vitality of a tooth. A false positive result can occur due to several reasons. An immature apex, choice A, can lead to a false positive result because the pulp is still vital and responsive. Improper isolation, choice B, can also lead to a false positive result if the electric current is conducted to a different tooth. Partial pulpal necrosis, choice C, can lead to a false positive result because some part of the pulp is still vital. However, anxiety, choice D, does not affect the results of an EPT test. Anxiety can affect the patient's perception of the test, but it does not change the actual electrical response of the pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
