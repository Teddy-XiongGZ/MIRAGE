    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluorosis is a condition that affects the teeth caused by excessive exposure to high concentrations of fluoride during tooth development. The critical period of exposure is between 1 and 4 years old, when the primary teeth are developing under the gums. Deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, start to calcify before birth and finish calcifying shortly after birth. Therefore, they are not exposed to fluoride during their development. The placenta does not act as a barrier to fluoride, and while fluoride is taken up by fast-growing skeletal tissue, this does not prevent fluorosis in permanent teeth. Therefore, the reason deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis is because their calcification time is less.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
