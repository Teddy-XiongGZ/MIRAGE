    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a respiratory problem that can be seen in babies who have birth by cesarean delivery. It's caused by fluid in the baby's lungs that can take a few days to clear. It's more common in babies delivered by elective cesarean section because labor helps to squeeze some of the fluid out of the lungs. Forceps, ventouse, or normal vaginal delivery usually involve labor, which helps to clear the fluid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Elective caesarean section\"}"
