    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The risk of injury in children increases as they become more mobile. At 8 months, most children are still crawling and not yet walking, so the risk of injury is lower. Between 10-12 months, many children start to walk, increasing their risk of injury. However, between 12-15 months, children are not only walking but also starting to climb, increasing their risk of injury even further. By 16 months, most children have developed enough motor skills and awareness to slightly decrease their risk of injury compared to the 12-15 months period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
