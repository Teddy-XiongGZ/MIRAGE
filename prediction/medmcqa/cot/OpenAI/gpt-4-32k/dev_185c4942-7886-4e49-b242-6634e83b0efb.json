    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-translational modification is a process that alters the properties of a protein by the addition of a functional group. Selenocysteine is a naturally occurring amino acid that is incorporated into proteins during translation, so it does not undergo post-translational modification. Triiodothyronine is a thyroid hormone, not an amino acid. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are both products of post-translational modification of proline and lysine, respectively.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Selenocysteine\"}"
