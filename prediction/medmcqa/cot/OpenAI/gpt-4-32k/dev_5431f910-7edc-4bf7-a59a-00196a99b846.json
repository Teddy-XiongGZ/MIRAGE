    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, the endocardium. It usually occurs when bacteria or other germs from another part of your body, such as your mouth, spread through your bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in your heart. The risk of endocarditis is higher in heart conditions that cause turbulent blood flow, which can lead to damage of the endocardium. VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect), MR (Mitral Regurgitation), and AR (Aortic Regurgitation) all cause turbulent blood flow, increasing the risk of endocarditis. However, ASD (Atrial Septal Defect) typically does not cause turbulent blood flow, and thus does not increase the risk of endocarditis as much as the other conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. ASD\" }"
