    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Occlusal adjustment refers to the modification of the biting surfaces of teeth to improve function or comfort. It is influenced by various factors such as the compensating curve, which is the curvature of the occlusal plane, cusp height, which affects the depth of the occlusal contacts, and incisal guidance, which is the influence of the contacting surfaces of the anterior teeth on tooth position. However, postural position, which refers to the position of the body, does not directly affect occlusal adjustment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
