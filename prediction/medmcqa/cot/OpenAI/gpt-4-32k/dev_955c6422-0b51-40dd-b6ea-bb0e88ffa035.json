    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel rods, also known as enamel prisms, are tightly packed, highly mineralized units of tooth enamel. They are the basic unit of the enamel structure. The length of enamel rods is indeed the same as the thickness of enamel, so option A is true. Enamel rods are narrow at the Dentinoenamel Junction (DEJ) and wide at the tooth surface, so option B is also true. Under a light microscope, enamel rods can be seen as a fish scale pattern, so option C is true. However, the tail of the enamel rod is not more resistant to caries than the core. In fact, the core is more mineralized and therefore more resistant to caries, making option D false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
