    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An epidemic refers to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in the population in that area. Sporadic refers to a disease that occurs infrequently and irregularly. An outbreak carries the same definition of epidemic, but is often used for a more limited geographic area. Endemic refers to the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area. In this case, the center reports 40 to 50 cases in a week normally, and this week there are 48 cases, which is within the normal range. Therefore, this is not an epidemic, sporadic, or outbreak, but rather it is endemic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Endemic\"}"
