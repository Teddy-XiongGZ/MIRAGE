    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found in several tissues throughout the body. The highest concentrations of alkaline phosphatase are present in the cells that comprise bone and the liver. Elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood can indicate disease in these tissues or in tissues with lesser concentrations of the enzyme. Paget's disease (A) is a bone disorder and can cause an increase in alkaline phosphatase. Osteomalacia (C) is a softening of the bones caused by severe vitamin D deficiency, which can also lead to an increase in alkaline phosphatase. Hyperthyroidism (D) can cause an increase in alkaline phosphatase. Multiple myeloma (B), however, is a cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell, which does not typically cause an increase in alkaline phosphatase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
