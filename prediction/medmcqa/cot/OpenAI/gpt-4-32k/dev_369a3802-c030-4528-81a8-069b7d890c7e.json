    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development consists of four stages. The sensorimotor stage is the first stage, occurring from birth to approximately age two. During this stage, infants and toddlers acquire knowledge through sensory experiences and manipulating objects. A key feature of this stage is the development of object permanence - the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or otherwise sensed. This is typically developed around 6-9 months of age. The other stages (pre-operational, concrete operations, and formal operations) occur later in development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Sensorimotor\"}"
