    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Callus formation is a part of the bone healing process. It is the body's natural response to a fracture and is a sign that the healing process is underway. Rigid immobilization, compression plating, and intraosseous nailing are all methods used to stabilize a fracture and promote healing. However, they do not directly increase callus formation. On the other hand, movement at the fracture site can stimulate callus formation as the body tries to stabilize the fracture and promote healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
