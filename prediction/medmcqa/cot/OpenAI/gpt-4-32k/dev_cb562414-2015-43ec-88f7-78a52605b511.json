    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. It works by stimulating alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Bronchodilation is achieved by the action of adrenaline on beta-receptors in the lungs (option A). Cardiovascular effects such as increased heart rate and contractility are achieved by the action of adrenaline on beta-receptors in the heart (option B). Vasoconstriction, which helps to increase blood pressure, is achieved by the action of adrenaline on alpha-receptors in the blood vessels (option C). However, the action of adrenaline on presynaptic alpha-receptors (option D) is not typically observed in the management of anaphylaxis. These receptors are found in the nerve endings and when stimulated, they inhibit the release of norepinephrine, reducing sympathetic tone. This is not a desired effect in the management of anaphylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
