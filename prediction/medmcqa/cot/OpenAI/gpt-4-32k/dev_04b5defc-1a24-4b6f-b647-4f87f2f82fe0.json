    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a structure similar to the Pesanserinus, which is a conjoined tendon in the knee formed by the tendons of three muscles: the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus. The options provided are all related to the head and neck region. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a joint, not a tendon structure. The parotid and submandibular glands are salivary glands, not tendon structures. The cheek is a facial feature composed of skin, fat, and muscles, but it does not have a similar tendon structure to the Pesanserinus. Therefore, none of the options provided have a similar structure to the Pesanserinus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
