    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The investigator wants to compare the means of more than two groups (non-smokers, light smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers). The Student-t test is used to compare the means of two groups, so it's not suitable here. The Chi square test is used for categorical data, which is not the case here. Between one way and two way ANOVA, the one way ANOVA is used when we want to test the effects of one single factor on a response variable, which is the case here as the single factor is the smoking status (non-smokers, light smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers) and the response variable is the mean peak flow of expiratory rates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. One way ANOVA\"}"
