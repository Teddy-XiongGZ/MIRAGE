    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Centrineuraxial anesthesia, which includes spinal and epidural anesthesia, is generally contraindicated in patients with low platelet counts (less than 80,000), as it can increase the risk of bleeding. Similarly, patients on oral anticoagulants are also at a higher risk of bleeding, so this procedure is typically avoided. Raised intracranial pressure is another contraindication because the procedure can potentially exacerbate the condition. However, patients on aspirin are not necessarily contraindicated for this procedure. While aspirin does have blood-thinning properties, its effect is not as significant as that of anticoagulants, and the risk of bleeding is generally considered manageable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Patient on aspirin\"}"
