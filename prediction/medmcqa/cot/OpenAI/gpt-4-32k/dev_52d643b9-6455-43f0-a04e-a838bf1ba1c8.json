    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pure left-sided heart failure is a condition where the left side of the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to a buildup of fluid in the lungs. Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) is a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of your heart (atria). This defect allows oxygen-rich blood to leak into the oxygen-poor blood chambers in the heart. This is not a cause of pure left-sided heart failure. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve opening. This restricts the blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and may also affect the pressure in the left atrium. This can lead to left-sided heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus is a persistent opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart. This condition can lead to heart failure, but it's not specific to the left side. Pulmonary valvular obstruction is a condition that affects the flow of blood from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, which is a right heart issue, not a left one.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
