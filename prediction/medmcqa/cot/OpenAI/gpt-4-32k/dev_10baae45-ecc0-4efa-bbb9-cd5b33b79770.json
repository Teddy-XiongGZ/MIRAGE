    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The McRoberts maneuver is a common obstetric procedure used to assist in difficult deliveries, particularly in cases of shoulder dystocia. It involves hyperflexing the mother's legs tightly to her abdomen. This can straighten the angle of the pelvis and can often allow for the baby to be delivered more easily. The lumbosacral trunk is a nerve structure that is formed from the union of the L4 and L5 nerve roots, and it contributes to the formation of the sacral plexus. It is located in the pelvis, and could potentially be affected by the extreme pelvic positioning in the McRoberts maneuver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Lumbosacral trunk\"}"
