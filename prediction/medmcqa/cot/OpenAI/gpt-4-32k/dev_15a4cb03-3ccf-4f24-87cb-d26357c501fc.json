    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Wide divergent roots of primary teeth can cause problems both during resorption and extraction. During resorption, the apical 1/3rd may remain unresorbed due to the wide divergence. Similarly, during extraction, the wide divergence can lead to a higher risk of fracture of the apical 1/3rd. Therefore, both statements are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
