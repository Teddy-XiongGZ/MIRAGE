    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Relining and rebasing of a complete denture are procedures done to improve the fit of the denture. This is usually necessary when there is a change in the supporting tissues, such as the alveolar bone, that the denture rests on. Option A, excessive alveolar bone loss, and option D, more than 2mm loss of alveolar bone height, both describe situations where there has been a change in the supporting tissues, making these viable options. Option B, when centric relation and centric occlusion do not coincide, is a situation that would require adjustment of the occlusal surfaces of the denture, not relining or rebasing. Option C, the patient is poor and cannot afford a new denture, is not a clinical indication for relining or rebasing a denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
