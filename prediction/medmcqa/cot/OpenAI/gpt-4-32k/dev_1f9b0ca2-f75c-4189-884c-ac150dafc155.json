    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The third molar, also known as the wisdom tooth, is located at the back of the mouth. During its surgical extraction, a distal incision is made, which is curved buccally (towards the cheek). The buccal artery is not a major concern in this area. Temporalis fibers are related to the temporalis muscle, which is located at the side of the head, not in the oral cavity. The BFP (Buccal Fat Pad) is not typically at risk during a third molar extraction. The lingual nerve, however, runs close to the third molar on the tongue side (lingual side) of the jaw, and it could be injured if the incision is not curved buccally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lingual nerve\"}"
