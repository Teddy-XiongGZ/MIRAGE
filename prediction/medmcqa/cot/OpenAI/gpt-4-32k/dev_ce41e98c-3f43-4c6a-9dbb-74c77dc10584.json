    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The extra-embryonic mesoderm is a layer of cells that forms during the development of an embryo. It is derived from the epiblast, which is the outermost layer of an embryo in early development. The epiblast gives rise to all three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as well as extraembryonic structures. The yolk sac and hypoblast do not give rise to the extra-embryonic mesoderm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Epiblast\"}"
