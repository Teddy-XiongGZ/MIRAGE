    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, the age of the mother is not the only factor that determines the risk of having a Down's syndrome baby. Although the risk increases with age, younger women can also have Down's syndrome babies. Since this woman already has a Down's syndrome child, her risk is higher than that of the general population. A blood test or an ultrasound (USG) can provide some information, but they are not definitive tests.
