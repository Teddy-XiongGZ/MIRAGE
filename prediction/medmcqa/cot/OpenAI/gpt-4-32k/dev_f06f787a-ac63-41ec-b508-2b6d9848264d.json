    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute phase reactants are proteins whose plasma concentrations increase (positive acute phase reactants) or decrease (negative acute phase reactants) in response to inflammation. Ferritin, Haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein are all positive acute phase reactants, meaning their levels increase in response to inflammation. Albumin, on the other hand, is a negative acute phase reactant, meaning its level decreases in response to inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Albumin\"}"
