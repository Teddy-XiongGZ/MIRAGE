    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SCC stands for Squamous Cell Carcinoma, a type of cancer that can occur in various parts of the body, including the tongue. The staging T2N0 indicates that the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm and there is no spread to nearby lymph nodes. The treatment options for SCC of the tongue usually involve surgery to remove the tumor. The question is asking about the extent of lymph node dissection. The lymph nodes in the neck are divided into five levels (I-V). In the case of T2N0, there is no evidence of lymph node involvement, so a selective neck dissection, such as a supraomohyoid neck dissection (SOHND), which typically includes levels I-III, would be appropriate. This is less extensive than removing lymph nodes I-V or I-IV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. SOHND (supraomohyoid neck dissections)\"}"
