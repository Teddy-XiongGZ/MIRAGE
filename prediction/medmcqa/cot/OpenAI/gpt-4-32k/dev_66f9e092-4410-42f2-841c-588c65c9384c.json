    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mean and standard deviation are statistical measures that require numerical data. Nominal scale is a naming scale, where variables are simply 'named' or 'labeled', with no specific order. Dichotomous scale is a type of nominal scale which consists of only two categories. Ordinal scale is a ranking scale where variables are ranked in a certain order, but the difference between the variables is not known. Interval/Ratio scale is a scale which not only produces the order of variables but also makes the difference between variables known and measurable. Therefore, to calculate mean and standard deviation, we need data on an interval/ratio scale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Interval/Ratio scale\"}"
