    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelography is a type of imaging study where a contrast dye is injected into the spinal canal to visualize the spinal cord and nerve roots. In the case of an intramedullary tumor, the contrast filled space would be compressed, not expanded, because the tumor is inside the spinal cord. Similarly, an extradural tumor would compress the contrast filled space from outside the dura mater. Spinal dysraphism is a congenital condition that affects the development of the spinal cord, but it doesn't necessarily cause expansion of the contrast filled space. An intradural extramedullary tumor, however, is located inside the dura mater but outside the spinal cord. This would push the spinal cord away, causing expansion of the contrast filled space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Intradural extramedullary tumor\"}"
