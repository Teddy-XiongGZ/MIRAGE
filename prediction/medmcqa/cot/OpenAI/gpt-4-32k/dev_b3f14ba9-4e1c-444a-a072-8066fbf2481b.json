    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A periodontal pocket is a dental condition where a pocket forms and deepens around a tooth, which can lead to inflammation and infection. This condition is typically associated with an immune response, which involves the increase of certain types of cells. Plasma cells, leukocytes, and lymphocytes are all part of the immune system, while erythrocytes are not. Among these, plasma cells are the ones that produce antibodies to fight against bacteria and other foreign substances, which are likely to be present in a periodontal pocket. Therefore, the number of plasma cells would be most increased in the connective tissue wall of a periodontal pocket.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
