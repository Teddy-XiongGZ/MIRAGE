    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Penicillinase is an enzyme that can inactivate penicillin by breaking down its structure. Some bacteria produce this enzyme to resist the effects of penicillin. Penicillinase-resistant penicillins are modified forms of penicillin that are resistant to the action of this enzyme. Amoxycillin, Ampicillin, and Penicillin G are not resistant to penicillinase. Cloxacillin, however, is a type of penicillin that is resistant to penicillinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cloxacillin\"}"
