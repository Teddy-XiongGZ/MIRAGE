    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anatomical dead space refers to the portion of the respiratory system where gas exchange does not occur, such as the trachea and bronchi. The Xenon dilution technique is a method used to measure total lung volume, not specifically the anatomical dead space. Bohler's method is used for the treatment of fractures, not for calculating anatomical dead space. Spirometry is a common office test used to assess how well your lungs work by measuring how much air you inhale, how much you exhale and how quickly you exhale, but it does not specifically measure anatomical dead space. The single breath nitrogen test, however, is used to measure the anatomical dead space. During this test, the subject takes a single breath of 100% oxygen. The nitrogen concentration in the exhaled air is then measured. Since nitrogen is not absorbed in the lungs, the increase in nitrogen concentration during exhalation represents the emptying of the anatomical dead space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
