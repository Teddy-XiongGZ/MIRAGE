    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a sudden deceleration event like a car crash, the body parts that are most likely to be injured are those that are mobile and not well protected. The liver is a large, solid organ located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, just below the diaphragm. It is relatively mobile and not well protected by the rib cage, making it susceptible to injury during a sudden deceleration. The spleen, mesentery, and abdominal aorta are also susceptible to injury, but they are more protected and less mobile than the liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Liver\"}"
