    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cardiac pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin in your chest to help control your heartbeat. It's used to help your heart beat more regularly if you have an irregular heartbeat. To determine the position of a misplaced implant, we need an imaging technique that can visualize the device and its leads. An X-ray is a quick, painless test that produces images of the structures inside your body, particularly your bones. It can easily show the position of the pacemaker and its leads. A CT scan could also show this, but it is more expensive and exposes the patient to a higher dose of radiation. MRI is generally avoided in patients with pacemakers because the strong magnetic fields can interfere with the device. Ultrasound (USG) is not typically used to visualize pacemakers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
