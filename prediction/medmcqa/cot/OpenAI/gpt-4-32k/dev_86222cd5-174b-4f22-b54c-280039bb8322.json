    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's description of the headache as the 'worst headache of his life' is a classic symptom of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is a type of stroke caused by bleeding on the surface of the brain. The first step in diagnosing a subarachnoid hemorrhage is usually a CT scan of the brain, which can often detect the bleeding. If the CT scan is negative but a subarachnoid hemorrhage is still suspected, a lumbar puncture can be performed. MRI is not typically the first choice in this acute setting. Observation and analgesics would not be appropriate as the first step given the severity of the symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. CT brain\"}"
