    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a statistical test to compare the rates of extubation failure between two different methods. The data is categorical (failure or success of extubation) and we are comparing two independent groups (those treated with conventional cPAP and those treated with bubble cPAP). The Chi square test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a sample. Therefore, it is the most appropriate test in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
