    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a child who has dental difficulties due to his behavior, which is traced back to his mother. The best way to handle this situation would be to address the root cause of the problem, which is the child's fear or anxiety related to dental procedures. Introducing another child as a good example (option A) might not be effective because it doesn't directly address the child's fear. Using small amounts of barbiturates (option C) is not a good solution because it involves medicating the child, which should be a last resort. Using firmness (option D) might not be effective because it could potentially increase the child's fear or anxiety. Therefore, the best option is to modify his fear by familiarization (option B), which involves gradually exposing the child to dental procedures in a non-threatening way to reduce his fear.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
