    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a respiratory disorder seen shortly after delivery in early term or late preterm babies. It's caused by retained fetal lung fluid due to impaired clearance mechanisms. The characteristic radiological feature of TTN is prominent horizontal fissure, which is due to the fluid in the fissure. Reticulogranular appearance is more associated with respiratory distress syndrome. Low volume lungs are seen in conditions like atelectasis. Air bronchogram is a sign of lung consolidation, which is not typical for TTN.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Prominent horizontal fissure\"}"
