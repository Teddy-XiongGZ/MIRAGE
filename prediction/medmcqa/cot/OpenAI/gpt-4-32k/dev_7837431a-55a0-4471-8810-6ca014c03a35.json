    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium channels play a crucial role in the propagation of action potentials in neurons. When an action potential is initiated, sodium channels open, allowing sodium ions to flow into the neuron, which depolarizes the membrane and propagates the action potential. If sodium channel inactivation is prolonged, it means that these channels remain closed for a longer period of time. This would prevent sodium ions from entering the neuron, which would disrupt the propagation of action potentials. This would lead to a conduction blockade, or a failure to transmit signals along the nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
