    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Formalin is a commonly used fixative in histology, it helps to preserve tissues by cross-linking the proteins, which can prevent autolysis, so option A is true. It also makes the tissue rigid, which is necessary for thin sectioning, so option B is true. Formalin also kills microorganisms, so option C is true. However, the concentration of formalin used for tissue preservation is typically 10%, not 2%, so option D is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
