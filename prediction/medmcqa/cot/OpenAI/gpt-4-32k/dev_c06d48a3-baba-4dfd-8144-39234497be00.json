    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a distribution that is created by plotting the means of all possible samples from a population. This is not a sample distribution, as that would be the distribution of a single sample. It's also not a population distribution, as that would be the distribution of the entire population. A parametric distribution is a type of statistical distribution that has a specific form, but it's not specifically about means of samples. The correct term for this is a sampling distribution, which is the probability distribution of a statistic based on a random sample.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
