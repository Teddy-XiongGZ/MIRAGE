    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reversible hydrocolloid is a type of dental impression material that changes from a sol (liquid) to a gel (solid) and back again. This transformation is not dependent on the concentration of fillers, plasticizer, or potassium sulphate. Instead, it is a function of temperature. When the temperature is increased, the material changes from a gel to a sol, and when the temperature is decreased, it changes from a sol to a gel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
