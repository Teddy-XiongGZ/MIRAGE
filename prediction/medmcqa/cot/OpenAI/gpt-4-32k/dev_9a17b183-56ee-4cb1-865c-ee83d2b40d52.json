    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and hypoglycemia suggest a problem with glucose metabolism. The consumption of raw eggs is a clue to the deficiency of a specific enzyme. Raw eggs contain a protein called avidin, which binds biotin and prevents its absorption. Biotin is a cofactor for several carboxylase enzymes, including pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate carboxylase is involved in gluconeogenesis, the process of making glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. A deficiency in this enzyme would impair the body's ability to produce glucose, leading to hypoglycemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pyruvate carboxylase\"}"
