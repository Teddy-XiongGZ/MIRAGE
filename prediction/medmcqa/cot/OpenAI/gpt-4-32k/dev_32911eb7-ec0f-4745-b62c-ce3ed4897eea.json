    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intermediate filaments are a type of cytoskeletal component. They are composed of several different proteins, depending on the specific type of intermediate filament. Vimentin, keratin, and desmin are all types of proteins that form intermediate filaments. However, tubulin is a protein that forms microtubules, which are a different component of the cytoskeleton. Therefore, tubulin is not a monomeric intermediate filament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
