    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The LDL receptor is a molecule located on the surface of cells that binds low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a particle in the blood that carries cholesterol and fats. The LDL receptor recognizes and binds to apo B100 and apo E, which are proteins on the surface of the LDL particle. This is the first step in the process of endocytosis, where the cell engulfs the LDL particle to bring it inside the cell. The LDL receptor is present in many types of cells, including both hepatic (liver) cells and extrahepatic (non-liver) cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
