    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentin conditioner is used in dentistry to prepare the tooth surface for bonding with restorative materials. It primarily functions to remove the smear layer, which is a layer of debris and cut dentin that forms on the surface of the tooth during drilling. This allows for better adhesion of the restorative material to the tooth surface. While it may indirectly increase the surface energy of dentin, form a thin resin layer over exposed collagen fibrils, and help in bonding with composite, these are not the primary function of a dentin conditioner.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
