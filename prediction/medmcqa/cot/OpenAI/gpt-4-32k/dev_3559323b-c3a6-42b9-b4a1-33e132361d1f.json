    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Parotidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the parotid gland, which is one of the major salivary glands. The parotid gland is located in front of the ear and extends to the area beneath the earlobe. The facial nerve runs through the parotid gland and is responsible for facial expressions. However, it does not provide sensation to the face. The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve, which provides sensation to the face. It specifically provides sensation to the area around the ear and the temple. The greater auricular nerve provides sensation to the ear and the area around the ear. The occipital nerve provides sensation to the back of the head. Therefore, numbness after parotidectomy would most likely be due to injury to the nerve that provides sensation to the area around the ear, which is the auriculotemporal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Auriculotemporal nerve\"}"
