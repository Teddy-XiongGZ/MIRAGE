    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tension, torsion, and compression are all forces that can lead to fractures. Tension is a force that pulls on a material, torsion is a twisting force, and compression is a force that pushes on a material. All of these forces can cause a bone to fracture if they are strong enough. Therefore, the maximum chances of fracture are present when any of these forces are present on a bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Either of the three\"}"
