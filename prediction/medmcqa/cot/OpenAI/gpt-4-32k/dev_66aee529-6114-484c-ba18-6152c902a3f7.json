    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"NK cells, or Natural Killer cells, are a type of lymphocyte that play a crucial role in the host-rejection of both tumors and virally infected cells. They are part of the innate immune system and do not require activation to kill cells that do not express 'self' proteins, such as MHC I. In a normal cell, MHC I is expressed and NK cells are inhibited. However, in a virally infected cell or tumor cell, MHC I expression is often downregulated or absent, which removes the inhibition and allows the NK cell to kill the target cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Unable to express MHC class I proteins\"}"
