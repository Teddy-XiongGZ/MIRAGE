    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A caesarean section is a surgical procedure used to deliver a baby through incisions in the abdomen and uterus. It is typically performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. Eisenmenger's syndrome is a severe form of pulmonary hypertension. It is a high-risk condition for pregnancy and can lead to serious complications, so a caesarean section may be indicated. Aortic stenosis is a condition where the heart's aortic valve narrows, which can cause complications during pregnancy and may require a caesarean section. Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a condition in which the heart's mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in the heart. This can also lead to complications during pregnancy and may require a caesarean section. Aortic regurgitation is a condition where the aortic valve doesn't close tightly, causing blood to leak from the aorta back into the left ventricle. This condition is typically well-tolerated during pregnancy and doesn't usually require a caesarean section.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Aortic regurgitation\"}"
