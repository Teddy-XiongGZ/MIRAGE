    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia type II, also known as familial hypercholesterolemia, is a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels. It is specifically due to a mutation in the gene that codes for the LDL receptor. This mutation results in a decrease in the number of LDL receptors, which leads to an increase in the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. Apoprotein B-100, Apoprotein C, and Lipoprotein lipase are not directly related to this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. LDL receptor\"}"
