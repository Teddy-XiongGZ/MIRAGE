    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Le Fort I osteotomy is a surgical procedure that involves the maxilla. The blood supply to the maxilla is provided by several arteries, including the posterior superior alveolar artery, the anterior superior alveolar artery, the greater palatine artery, and the ascending palatine branch of the facial artery. However, after a Le Fort I osteotomy, the maxilla is separated from the pterygoid plates and the nasal septum, but it remains attached at the pterygopalatine fossa, which is where the greater palatine artery is located. Therefore, the blood supply of the maxilla after a Le Fort I osteotomy is maintained by the greater palatine artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Greater palatine artery\"}"
