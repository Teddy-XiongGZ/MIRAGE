    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nodal metastasis refers to the spread of cancer to lymph nodes. A CT scan can detect various characteristics of nodal metastasis. A spiculated node refers to a node with irregular or spiky borders, which can be seen on a CT scan. Nodes larger than 6 mm can also be detected on a CT scan. A necrotic node, which is a node with dead tissue, can also be seen on a CT scan. A rounded node, which is a node with a round shape, can also be seen on a CT scan. However, the shape of the node (rounded or not) is not a definitive indicator of metastasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Rounded node\"}"
