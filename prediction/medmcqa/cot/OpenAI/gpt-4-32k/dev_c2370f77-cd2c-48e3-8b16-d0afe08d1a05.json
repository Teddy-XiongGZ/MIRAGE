    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inter-arch distance refers to the distance between the upper and lower dental arches. When the occlusal rims are in uniform contact, it means that the jaws are closed and the teeth are in maximum contact with each other. This is not the freeway space, which is the space when the jaws are at rest and not in contact. It's also not the vertical dimension of rest, which is the distance between two points when the mandible is in the physiological rest position. Christensen's space refers to the space between the posterior parts of the upper and lower denture bases that appears when the patient opens the mouth wide. Therefore, the correct answer is the vertical dimension of occlusion, which is the distance measured when the jaws are closed and the teeth (or occlusal rims) are in maximum contact.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Vertical dimension of occlusion\"}"
