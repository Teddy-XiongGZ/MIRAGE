    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malocclusion refers to the misalignment of teeth, which is often assessed by examining the relationship between the upper and lower jaws. The maxilla and mandible are the two bones that house the teeth. The zygomatic buttress and sphenoid bone are facial bones but they do not directly involve in occlusion. Therefore, the key ridge useful in assessing malocclusion should be present on either the maxilla or the mandible. However, the mandible is more often used in assessing malocclusion because it is the movable part of the jaw that can cause misalignment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Mandible\"}"
