    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental plaque is a biofilm or mass of bacteria that grows on surfaces within the mouth. It is a sticky colorless deposit at first, but when it forms tartar, it is often brown or pale yellow. It is commonly found between the teeth, along the gum line, and on the front of the tongue. The bacteria in the mouth convert sugars from the food we eat to acids, and it's the acids that begin to eat away at the tooth enamel, causing cavities. The primary sugar that bacteria love to eat is sucrose, which is a common sugar found in many foods. Saliva also plays a role in the formation of dental plaque because it helps to neutralize acids and wash away dead cells that accumulate on the teeth. Therefore, dental plaque is formed by the reaction of enzymes on sucrose and saliva.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sucrose and saliva\"}"
