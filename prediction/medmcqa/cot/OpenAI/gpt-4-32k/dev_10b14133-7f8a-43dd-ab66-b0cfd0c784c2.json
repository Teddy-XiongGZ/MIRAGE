    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system and is caused by the pork tapeworm. The disease has four stages: vesicular, colloidal vesicular, granular nodular, and nodular calcified. In the vesicular stage, the parasite is alive and there is no host response, hence no edema. In the colloidal vesicular stage, the parasite dies and the host responds, causing edema. In the granular nodular stage, the host response is more intense, leading to more edema. In the nodular calcified stage, the parasite is completely dead and calcified, and there is no edema. However, the question asks for the stage where there is no edema, and that would be the vesicular stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
