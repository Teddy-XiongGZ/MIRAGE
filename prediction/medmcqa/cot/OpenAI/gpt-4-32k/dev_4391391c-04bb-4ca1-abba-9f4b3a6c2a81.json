    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 76-year-old female with a non-healing ulcer on the labia majora, which has been present for 6 months. The biopsy shows squamous cell carcinoma. The absence of palpable lymphadenopathy suggests that the cancer may not have spread to the lymph nodes. The management of this patient would typically involve surgical removal of the tumor. A radical vulvectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (option A) is usually performed when there is suspicion of lymph node involvement, which is not the case here. Chemoradiation with resection (option D) is typically reserved for advanced cases. A simple vulvectomy (option C) involves removal of the entire vulva, which may not be necessary in this case. A wide excision (option B), which involves removing the tumor along with a margin of healthy tissue, would be a suitable approach in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
