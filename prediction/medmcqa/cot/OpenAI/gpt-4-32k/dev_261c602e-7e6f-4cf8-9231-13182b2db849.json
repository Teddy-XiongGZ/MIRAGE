    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A. Decremental - This is not true. Propagated nerve action potentials are not decremental; they maintain their strength as they travel along the nerve fiber. B. Not affected by hypoxia - This is not true. Hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, can affect the ability of the nerve to generate an action potential. C. Fastest in C fibers - This is not true. C fibers are unmyelinated and have the slowest conduction velocity. D. Not affected by membrane capacitance - This is not true. The membrane capacitance affects the speed of the action potential propagation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
