    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Marginal bone loss around a mandibular implant can be influenced by several factors. The abutment, or the part of the implant that supports the dental prosthesis, can affect bone loss if it is not properly fitted or if there is a lack of biocompatibility. The boning technique, or the method used to prepare the bone for the implant, can also affect bone loss if it is not done correctly. The implant fixture, which is the part of the implant that is inserted into the bone, can also influence bone loss if it is not properly designed or placed. However, the connector, which is used to attach the abutment to the implant fixture, does not directly influence bone loss around the implant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Connector\"}"
