    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heart muscle, also known as cardiac muscle, has several unique characteristics. A. It acts as a syncytium, meaning that the cells are connected in a network allowing for coordinated contraction. C. It has gap junctions, which are specialized intercellular connections that allow for direct electrical and metabolic coupling of adjacent cells. D. It has a branching structure, which is important for the propagation of electrical signals and the coordinated contraction of the heart. However, B. cardiac muscle cells typically have only one or two nuclei, not multiple nuclei.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
