    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rubber dam is a thin sheet used in dentistry to isolate the treatment area from the rest of the oral cavity. If the gingiva is seen protruding out of the margins of the dam, it could be due to several reasons. It's not likely due to using a light-weight dam, as the weight of the dam doesn't affect how it fits around the gingiva. The placement of the holes in the dam could affect how it fits, but if the holes were too far apart, the dam would be loose and not fit tightly around the teeth. If the holes were too close together, the dam would be stretched too tightly and could cause the gingiva to protrude. However, if the gingival tissues are edematous, or swollen, they could also protrude out of the margins of the dam.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Edematous gingival tissues\"}"
