    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. It is a process that is controlled by dedicated genes, so option D is true. During apoptosis, the plasma membrane remains intact, which prevents the leakage of intracellular contents that could trigger inflammation, so options A and B are also true. However, apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies, not by organelle swelling. Therefore, option C is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
