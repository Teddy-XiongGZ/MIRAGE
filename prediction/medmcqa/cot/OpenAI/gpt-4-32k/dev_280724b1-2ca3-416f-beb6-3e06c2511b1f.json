    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spherical alloys are made up of small, round particles. This allows them to flow and adapt better when they are condensed, requiring less force. On the other hand, lathe cut alloys are irregular and require more force to condense. Therefore, less condensing force is required for spherical alloys as compared to lathe cut.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
