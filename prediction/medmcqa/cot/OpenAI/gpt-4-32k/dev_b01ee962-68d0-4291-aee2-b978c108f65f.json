    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The diaphragm is primarily composed of muscle tissue, not collagen. The basement membrane is a thin, fibrous, extracellular matrix of tissue that separates the lining of an internal or external body surface from underlying connective tissue - it's not specifically known for long spaced collagen. The tympanic membrane, or eardrum, is a thin, cone-shaped membrane that separates the external ear from the middle ear. Its function is to transmit sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear. It's not characterized by long spaced collagen. The cornea, however, is known for its unique arrangement of collagen fibers. The collagen fibrils in the cornea are uniformly small and regularly arranged in a lattice pattern, which gives the cornea its strength and transparency. This unique arrangement could be referred to as 'long spaced'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cornea\"}"
