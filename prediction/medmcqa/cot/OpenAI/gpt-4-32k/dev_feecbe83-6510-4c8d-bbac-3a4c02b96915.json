    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include progressive jaundice, which is a sign of liver disease. The liver function test results show elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, which are all signs of liver disease. However, the levels of SGOT and SGPT are not significantly elevated, which would be expected in viral hepatitis. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes an increase in conjugated bilirubin, but it is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, not in a 50-year-old patient. Choledocholithiasis, or stones in the common bile duct, could cause these symptoms, but it would typically also cause abdominal pain, which is not mentioned. Malignant obstructive jaundice, on the other hand, can cause these symptoms and lab findings. It is a condition where a tumor blocks the bile ducts, causing bile to build up in the liver and leading to jaundice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
