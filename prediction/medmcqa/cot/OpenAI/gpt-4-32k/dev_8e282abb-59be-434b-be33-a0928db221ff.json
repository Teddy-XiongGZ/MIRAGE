Resilon monoblock obturation is a system that uses a synthetic polymer-based root canal filling material (Resilon) and a dual-cure resin sealer (Epiphany) to achieve this. Active Gutta percha, Orthograde obturation with MTA, and Gutta Percha and AH plus sealer are not monoblock systems as they do not form a single unit with the canal wall.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
