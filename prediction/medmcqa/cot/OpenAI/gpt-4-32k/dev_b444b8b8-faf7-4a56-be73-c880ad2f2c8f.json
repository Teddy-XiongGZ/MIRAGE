    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The facial nerve, or cranial nerve VII, is responsible for the motor innervation of the muscles of facial expression. It does not directly govern mandibular stabilization. However, it can indirectly influence it through the muscles it innervates. In the context of swallowing, the facial nerve is involved in the lip closure, which is a part of the oral phase of swallowing. Infantile swallow, mature swallow, and retained infantile swallow all involve this oral phase, and thus, the facial nerve. On the other hand, complex tongue thrusting is a condition where the tongue pushes against or between the teeth during swallowing, speech, and even at rest. This condition is primarily governed by the hypoglossal nerve, which innervates the tongue muscles, not the facial nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
