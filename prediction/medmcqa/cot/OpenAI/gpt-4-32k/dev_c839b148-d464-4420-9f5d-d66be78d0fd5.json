    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is a group of conditions that occur when cells in the womb start to grow in an uncontrolled way. The staging of GTN is based on the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) system. Stage 1 is disease confined to the uterus. Stage 2 is GTN that has spread to other structures in the pelvis. Stage 3 is GTN that has spread to the lungs. Stage 4 is GTN that has spread to any other organ. In this case, the GTN has metastasized to the lungs, so it would be classified as Stage 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
