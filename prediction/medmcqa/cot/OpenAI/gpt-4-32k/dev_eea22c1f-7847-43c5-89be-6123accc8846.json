    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that has developed resistance to many commonly used antibiotics, including penicillin. This resistance is not due to pleomorphism, which is the ability of some microorganisms to alter their shape or size in response to environmental conditions. It's also not due to a lack of nucleic acid in the cell wall, as bacteria do have nucleic acids in their cell walls. Penicillin analogue production is not a mechanism of resistance either. The resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin is due to the production of an enzyme called beta-lactamase, which can break down the antibiotic and render it ineffective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
