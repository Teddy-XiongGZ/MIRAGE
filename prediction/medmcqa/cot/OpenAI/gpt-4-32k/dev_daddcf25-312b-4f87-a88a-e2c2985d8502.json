    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrocephalus is a condition that affects the brain, so an X-ray of the abdomen (option A) would not be useful in detecting it. Amniocentesis (option B) is a procedure that involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid to test for genetic disorders and certain birth defects, but it is not typically used to detect hydrocephalus. Clinical examination (option C) can be useful in diagnosing hydrocephalus after birth, but the question asks about antenatal detection. Ultrasonography (option D), specifically a prenatal ultrasound, can be used to detect hydrocephalus before birth by showing an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the baby's brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
