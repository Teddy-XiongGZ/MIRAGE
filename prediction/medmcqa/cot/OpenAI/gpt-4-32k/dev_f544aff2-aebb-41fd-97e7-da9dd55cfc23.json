    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Working side interference is a condition where there is an unwanted contact between the upper and lower teeth on the side of the jaw that is moving during chewing or grinding. This can cause discomfort and damage to the teeth. The guiding cusps are the teeth that guide the movement of the jaw during chewing and grinding. If these are too high, they can cause working side interference. Therefore, reducing the height of the guiding cusps can help to remove working side interference. The supporting cusps, on the other hand, are the teeth that support the bite and do not play a direct role in causing working side interference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
