    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth. The tongue is covered with moist, pink tissue called mucosa. Tiny bumps called papillae give the tongue its rough texture. Thousands of taste buds cover the surfaces of the papillae. The tongue is anchored to the mouth by webs of tough tissue and mucosa. The base of the tongue is located very near the throat (pharynx). The tongue aids in the formation of the sounds of speech and coordinates its movements to aid in swallowing. The primary effect of tongue movement is not on the palatoglossus arch, facial musculature, or cheeks. The tongue's movement primarily affects the lips, as it helps in the formation of certain sounds and words during speech.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Lips\"}"
