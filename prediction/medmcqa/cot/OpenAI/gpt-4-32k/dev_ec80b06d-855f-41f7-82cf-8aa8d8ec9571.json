    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Group II sensory fibers are a type of afferent nerve fibers that transmit sensory information from the body to the central nervous system. They are associated with muscle spindles, which are sensory receptors within the belly of a muscle, that primarily detect changes in the length of this muscle. The annulospiral endings, also known as primary endings, are the main sensory structures in muscle spindles and are wrapped around the central portion of each intrafusal muscle fiber. Therefore, Group II sensory fibers are attached to annulospiral endings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
