    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Uniparental disomy is a condition in which both copies of a chromosome or part of a chromosome come from the same parent, instead of one copy coming from the mother and one from the father. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome can both be caused by uniparental disomy, specifically of chromosome 15. Russell-Silver syndrome can also be caused by uniparental disomy, specifically of chromosome 7 or 11. However, Bloom syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 15, but it is not associated with uniparental disomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Bloom syndrome\"}"
