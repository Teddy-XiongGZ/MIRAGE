    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Granulation tissue is new connective tissue and microscopic blood vessels that form on the surfaces of a wound during the healing process. Thyroxine is a hormone the thyroid gland secretes into the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, thyroxine travels to the organs, like the liver and kidneys, where it is converted to its active form of triiodothyronine. Cortisone is a steroid hormone released by the adrenal cortex and is involved in the response to stress. Parathormone is secreted by the parathyroid glands and is important for bone remodeling. Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone and medication which is involved in regulating visceral functions. None of these hormones have a direct role in wound healing. However, cortisone, a type of glucocorticoid, has been shown to delay wound healing, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Thyroxine, parathormone, and epinephrine do not have a significant role in wound healing. Therefore, none of the options provided have a 'maximum effect' on granulation wound healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
