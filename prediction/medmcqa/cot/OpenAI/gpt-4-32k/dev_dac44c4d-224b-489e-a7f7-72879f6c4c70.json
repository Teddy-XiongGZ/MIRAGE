    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Relining and rebasing are two procedures used to resurface the tissue side of a denture with new base material, thus producing an accurate adaptation to the denture foundation area. The difference between them is that relining involves adding a new layer to the tissue surface of the denture, while rebasing is a process where the entire denture base material is replaced. Therefore, the change in rebasing of a denture is effected in the entire denture base.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Entire denture base\"}"
