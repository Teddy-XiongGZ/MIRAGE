    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intracellular receptors are found inside the cell rather than on its cell membrane. These types of receptors are generally found in the cytoplasm and are activated by hydrophobic ligand molecules that can pass through the plasma membrane. Glucagon, insulin, and epinephrine are all hormones that bind to cell surface receptors, not intracellular receptors. Thyroxine, on the other hand, is a thyroid hormone that is lipid-soluble and can cross the cell membrane to bind to intracellular receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Thyroxine\"}"
