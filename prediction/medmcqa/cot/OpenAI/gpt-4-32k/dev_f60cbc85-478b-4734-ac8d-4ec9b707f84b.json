    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A nasal fracture is a break in a bone in the nose. The most common cause is trauma. To visualize a nasal fracture, a radiographic view that focuses on the facial bones, particularly the nose, is needed. A reverse Towne's view is typically used for the mandible and the occipital bone, not the nasal bones. A PA view is a posterior-anterior view, which is not the best for visualizing nasal fractures. An OPG is an orthopantomogram, which is used to view the mandible and teeth. A true lateral view, however, provides a side view of the face, which can clearly show a nasal fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. True lateral\"}"
