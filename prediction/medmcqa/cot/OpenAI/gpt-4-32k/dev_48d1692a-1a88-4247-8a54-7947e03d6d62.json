    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anti-rotational design in a blade is a crucial aspect of its design. It helps to prevent the blade from rotating unintentionally, which can lead to inefficiencies or even damage. The offset mentioned in the question refers to the distance by which one feature of an object is out of line with another. In the context of blade design, this could refer to the distance by which the center of mass of the blade is offset from its axis of rotation. A larger offset could potentially lead to greater anti-rotational properties, but it could also lead to other issues such as increased stress on the blade. Therefore, there is a limit to how large this offset can be. After reviewing the options, the smallest offset value is 2 mm, which would likely be the safest and most optimal choice to prevent any potential issues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
