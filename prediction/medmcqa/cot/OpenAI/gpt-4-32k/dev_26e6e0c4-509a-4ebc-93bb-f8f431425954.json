    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to the effects of insulin. This can occur in liver disease due to several reasons. Decreased secretion of insulin is not the cause of insulin resistance, but rather a result of long-term insulin resistance. Low 'C' peptide level is also not the cause of insulin resistance, it's a marker of insulin production. Hepatocyte dysfunction could contribute to insulin resistance, but it's not the primary cause. Hepatic steatosis, or fatty liver disease, is a condition that is strongly associated with insulin resistance. The accumulation of fat in the liver can interfere with the liver's ability to respond to insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
