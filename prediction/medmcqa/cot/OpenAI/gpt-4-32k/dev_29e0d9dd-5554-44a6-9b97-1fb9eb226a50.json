    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. The survival of an ectopic pregnancy depends on the location within the fallopian tube. The ampulla of the fallopian tube is the widest part and hence can accommodate the growing embryo for a longer period of time compared to other parts. The isthmus, cornua, and interstitium are narrower and hence less likely to support a growing pregnancy for a long period of time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ampulla\"}"
