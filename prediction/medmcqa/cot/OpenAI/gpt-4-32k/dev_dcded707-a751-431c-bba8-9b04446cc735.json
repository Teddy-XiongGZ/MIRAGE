    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of muscle contraction involves several steps. The detachment of the myosin head from actin is not caused by the entry of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as this is involved in the initiation of muscle contraction. The change in troponin C configuration also plays a role in the initiation of muscle contraction, not the detachment of myosin from actin. The release of ADP and Pi is involved in the power stroke of muscle contraction. However, the binding of ATP to the myosin head is what causes the myosin head to detach from actin, as it reduces the affinity of myosin for actin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
