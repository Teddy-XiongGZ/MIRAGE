    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a normal blood glucose level, which rules out diabetes or any other condition that would cause an elevated glucose level. The Benedict's test is a simple biochemical reaction to detect the presence of reducing sugars. The positive Benedict's test in urine indicates the presence of a reducing sugar, but not necessarily glucose. Fructose and galactose are both reducing sugars, so they could potentially cause a positive Benedict's test. However, fructose is not typically found in urine, even in cases of fructosemia. Galactose, on the other hand, can be found in urine in cases of galactosemia. Therefore, galactosemia is the most likely cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Galactosemia\"}"
