    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Precocious puberty is the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls. The goal of treatment is to stop or even reverse sexual development and slow down rapid growth and bone maturation that can lead to adult short stature. GnRH analogues are the first-line treatment for central precocious puberty. They work by desensitizing the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, thereby reducing the release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and sex steroids. Cyproterone acetate, Danazol, and Medroxyprogesterone acetate are not the first-line treatments for precocious puberty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. GnRH analogues\"}"
