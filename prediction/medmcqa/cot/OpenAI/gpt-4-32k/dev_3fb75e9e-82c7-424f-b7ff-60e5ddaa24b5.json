    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The speed of induction of an inhalational agent depends on how quickly it can be absorbed into the bloodstream and reach the brain. This is influenced by factors such as the agent's blood gas solubility, the use of other agents, and the patient's lung function. A. High blood gas solubility means the agent dissolves easily in blood, but it also means it takes longer for the agent to saturate the blood and reach the brain, so induction is slower. C. Increased residual volume means the lungs are less efficient at exchanging gases, so induction is slower. D. A right to left shunt would bypass the lungs, so the agent would not be absorbed and induction would not occur. B. Nitrous oxide is a potent inhalational agent that is quickly absorbed and can speed up the induction of other agents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Combined with nitrous oxide\"}"
