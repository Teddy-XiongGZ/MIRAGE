    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The wrist joint, also known as the radiocarpal joint, is a complex joint in the body that is formed by the articulation of the distal end of the radius and the carpal bones. The scaphoid and triquetral are both carpal bones, so they are involved in the formation of the wrist joint. The radius is the main bone that articulates with the carpal bones to form the wrist joint. The ulna, on the other hand, does not directly articulate with the carpal bones to form the wrist joint. Instead, it articulates with the radius.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ulna\"}"
