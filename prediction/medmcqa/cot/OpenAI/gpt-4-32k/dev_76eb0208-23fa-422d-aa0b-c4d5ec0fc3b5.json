    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The intercuspal position refers to the position of the teeth when the jaws are closed and the teeth are in maximum contact. The lingual cusp of the maxillary 2nd premolar is the part of the tooth that is closest to the tongue. In this position, it would make contact with the opposing tooth in the lower jaw. The mandibular 1st molar is the tooth that is directly opposite the maxillary 2nd premolar. Therefore, the lingual cusp of the maxillary 2nd premolar would contact the mesial fossa of the mandibular 1st molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mesial fossa of mandibular 1st molar\"}"
