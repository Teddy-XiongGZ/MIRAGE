This could be due to a number of reasons, including structural abnormalities, chromosomal abnormalities, or hormonal issues. A transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) could help identify structural abnormalities, but it wouldn't provide information on chromosomal or hormonal issues. A hysteroscopy could also identify structural issues, but again, it wouldn't provide information on chromosomal or hormonal issues.
