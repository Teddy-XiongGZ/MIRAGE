    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-working side interference is a condition where there is contact between the upper and lower teeth on the side of the mouth that is not doing the chewing. This can cause discomfort and other problems. The supporting cusps are the parts of the teeth that make contact with each other. Reducing the height of these cusps can help to reduce non-working side interference. However, it's important to consider which jaw's supporting cusps to reduce. The maxillary supporting cusps are on the upper jaw, and the mandibular supporting cusps are on the lower jaw. Reducing the height of the maxillary supporting cusp can help to reduce non-working side interference because it is the upper teeth that usually cause this problem.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
