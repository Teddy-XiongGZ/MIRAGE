    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formation of multiple roots in multirooted teeth is a process that occurs during tooth development. This process is not due to the epithelial diaphragm or the cell rests of Malassez. The epithelial diaphragm is involved in the formation of the root canal system, while the cell rests of Malassez are remnants of the Hertwig's epithelial root sheath, involved in root formation. The formation of multiple roots is due to the division of the tooth bud or during the bell stage of tooth development, where the tooth bud splits into multiple buds, each forming a separate root.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Toot bud division or bell stage\"}"
