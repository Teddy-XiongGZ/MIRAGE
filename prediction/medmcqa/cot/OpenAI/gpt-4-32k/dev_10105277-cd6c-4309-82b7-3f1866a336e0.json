    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The respiratory center in the brainstem is primarily stimulated by changes in the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood. However, it is more sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide levels. An increase in arterial carbon dioxide level leads to an increase in hydrogen ions (acidosis), which stimulates the respiratory center to increase the rate and depth of breathing to expel more carbon dioxide and correct the imbalance. Therefore, an increase in arterial carbon dioxide level is the best stimulator of the respiratory center.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
