    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acrylic resin is a type of plastic that is made from a chemical reaction between a monomer and a catalyst. The monomer is the basic building block of the resin, and the catalyst is what causes the monomer to react and form long chains, creating the plastic. If too much monomer is added to the mixture, it can cause the resin to become overly flexible and weak, leading to low impact strength. Excessive expansion and excessive shrinkage are not typically associated with an excess of monomer. Excessive brittleness is usually a result of too little monomer, not too much.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Low impact strength\"}"
