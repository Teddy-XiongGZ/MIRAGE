    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The oral cavity is lined with different types of mucosa, each with varying degrees of sensitivity. The gingiva, or gums, are known to be quite sensitive due to the presence of numerous nerve endings. The buccal mucosa, which lines the inside of the cheeks, and the labial mucosa, which is the inside lining of the lips, are also sensitive due to their thinness and high vascularity. The dorsal mucosa of the tongue, however, is less sensitive due to its thicker epithelium and fewer nerve endings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Dorsal mucosa of tongue\"}"
