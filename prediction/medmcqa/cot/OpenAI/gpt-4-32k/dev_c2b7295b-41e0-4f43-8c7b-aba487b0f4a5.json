It includes the administration of a uterotonic drug, usually oxytocin, immediately after the delivery of the baby, controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta, and early clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord.

It is usually given after the delivery of the baby, not after the delivery of the anterior shoulder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
