    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Randomization in a clinical trial is a method used to reduce bias and ensure that the groups being compared are similar in all respects except for the intervention being tested. It does this by randomly assigning participants to either the treatment or control group, which reduces confounding and selection bias, and ensures comparability of the two groups. However, randomization does not necessarily increase the external validity of the trial. External validity refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other situations and populations. While randomization can help ensure that the sample is representative of the population, it does not guarantee that the results will be applicable to all populations or settings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
