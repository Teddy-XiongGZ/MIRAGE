    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a phenomenon in which the presence of certain antibodies actually enhances the entry and replication of a virus into host cells. This can lead to increased virulence and disease severity. ADE is not associated with Influenza, Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, or Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.
