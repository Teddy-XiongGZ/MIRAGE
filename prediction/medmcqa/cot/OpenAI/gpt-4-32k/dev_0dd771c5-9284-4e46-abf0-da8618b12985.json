    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The onset of puberty is a complex process that involves a variety of hormones. Insulin and growth hormone are important for overall growth and development, but they do not specifically trigger the onset of puberty. GnRH, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone, is a key player in initiating puberty, but it is not considered to have a permissive action. Leptin, on the other hand, is a hormone produced by fat cells that has been found to have a permissive role in the onset of puberty. It allows the body to know that there is enough energy reserve for the energy-consuming process of puberty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Leptin\"}"
