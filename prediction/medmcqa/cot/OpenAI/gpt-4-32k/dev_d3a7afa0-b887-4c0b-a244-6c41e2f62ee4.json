    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cervical vertebrae are the seven spinal bones that support the neck. The thoracic vertebrae are the twelve spinal bones that connect to the rib cage. The cervical vertebrae are unique in that they have a hole in each transverse process, called the foramen transversarium, which allows for the passage of the vertebral artery, vein, and nerve. The thoracic vertebrae do not have this feature. The body of the cervical vertebrae is small and wider from side to side, not triangular. The superior articular facet of the cervical vertebrae is directed upwards and backwards, but this is not a distinguishing feature from the thoracic vertebrae. The thoracic vertebrae have a larger vertebral body compared to the cervical vertebrae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
