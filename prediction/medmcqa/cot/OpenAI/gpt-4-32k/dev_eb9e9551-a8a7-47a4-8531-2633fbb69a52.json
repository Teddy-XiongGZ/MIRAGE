    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endodontic treatment involves the cleaning and shaping of the root canal system, which is often done using endodontic files. These files need to be cleaned in between uses to prevent cross-contamination. Hypochlorite solution is a common disinfectant used in endodontics due to its ability to dissolve organic matter and kill bacteria. Glass bead sterilizers are not recommended for sterilizing endodontic files as they may not effectively kill all bacteria and can cause damage to the files. Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic, but it is not typically used for cleaning endodontic files.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
