    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A gingivectomy is a periodontal surgical procedure that removes and reshapes loose, diseased gum tissue to get rid of pockets between the teeth and gums. It does not eliminate infra-bony pockets (A), as these are defects in the bone surrounding the tooth root. It does not facilitate healing by primary intention (D), as this refers to healing of a wound without granulation tissue formation, contraction, or epithelialization. It does not preserve the width of attached gingiva (C), as the procedure involves removing gum tissue. However, it does eliminate false pockets (B), which are deepened gingival sulcus due to gingival enlargement without apical migration of the epithelial attachment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
