    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies. Therefore, it is characterized by increased levels of immunoglobulins (Ig) in the serum (option A) and plasmacytosis, which is an increase in the number of plasma cells (option C). It also typically shows a monoclonal spike (M spike) on serum protein electrophoresis (option D), which is a laboratory test that separates proteins based on their size and charge. However, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, which is often seen in autoimmune diseases, is not a characteristic feature of multiple myeloma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
