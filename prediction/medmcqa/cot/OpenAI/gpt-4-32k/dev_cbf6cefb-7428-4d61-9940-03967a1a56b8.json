    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mean electrical axis of the heart is a measurement of the average direction of electrical activity during the cardiac cycle. An axis of 90 degrees is considered to be rightward and inferiorly directed. The lead that would show the maximum voltage of the R wave would be the one that is most aligned with this direction. Lead aVF is aligned in this direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. aVF\"}"
