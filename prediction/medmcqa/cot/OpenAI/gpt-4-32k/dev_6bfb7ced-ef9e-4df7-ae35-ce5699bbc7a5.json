    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intermediate filaments are a type of cytoskeletal component. They are composed of several different proteins, including vimentin, keratin, and desmin. These proteins are all monomers that polymerize to form the intermediate filament. Tubulin, on the other hand, is a component of microtubules, not intermediate filaments. Therefore, tubulin is not a monomeric intermediate filament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Tubulin\"}"
