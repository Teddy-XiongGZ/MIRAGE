    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During an asthmatic attack, the child should be in a position that allows for maximum lung expansion to facilitate breathing. The supine position, or lying flat on the back, may restrict lung expansion and make breathing more difficult. The Trendelenburg position, where the body is laid flat on the back with the feet higher than the head, is typically used for shock and is not appropriate for an asthmatic attack. The erect position, or standing straight up, may be too tiring for a child during an asthmatic attack. The semi-erect position, where the child is sitting up at an angle, allows for maximum lung expansion and is less tiring than standing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Semi erect\"}"
