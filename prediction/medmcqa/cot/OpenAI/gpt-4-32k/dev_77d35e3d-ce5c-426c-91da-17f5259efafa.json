    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GTCS stands for Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures. In a 2-year-old premature neonate, the cause of such seizures could be due to a variety of reasons including developmental abnormalities, infections, trauma, or metabolic disorders. The best investigation to diagnose the pathology would be the one that provides the most detailed view of the brain. Transcranial ultrasound is not as detailed and X-ray is not suitable for soft tissue imaging. A CT scan can provide a good image but exposes the child to radiation. An MRI of the brain provides the most detailed image without the use of radiation, making it the best choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. MRI brain\"}"
