    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"LA stands for Local Anesthetics. Local anesthetics work by blocking nerve conduction. They do this by inhibiting the influx of sodium ions across the nerve cell membrane, which is necessary for the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses. Therefore, they block the conductance of Na+ from exterior to interior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
