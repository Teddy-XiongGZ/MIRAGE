    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a person lies down, the effect of gravity on the body's blood flow changes. This change in position can lead to an immediate increase in venous return because the blood can flow back to the heart more easily due to the horizontal position. The heart rate doesn't necessarily become stable at slightly more than normal, it depends on various factors. Cerebral blood flow doesn't necessarily increase and become stable at more than normal, it is regulated by various factors and not just body position. Blood flow to the apex of the lung doesn't necessarily decrease when a person lies down, it can actually increase due to the redistribution of blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
