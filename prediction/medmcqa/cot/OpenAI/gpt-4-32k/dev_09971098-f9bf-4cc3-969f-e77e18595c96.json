    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman has a history of primary infertility and a hysterosalpingogram has shown bilateral tubal blockage at the cornu. This means that the fallopian tubes, which are necessary for natural conception, are blocked. Therefore, natural conception is unlikely. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a common treatment for women with blocked or damaged fallopian tubes because it bypasses the tubes. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy are diagnostic procedures, not treatments. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is a type of IVF that is typically used when there are severe male factor infertility issues, which is not indicated in this case. Tuboplasty is a surgical procedure to repair or remove blockages in the fallopian tubes, but it's not the first line treatment due to its invasive nature and lower success rates compared to IVF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
