    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The World Health Organization (WHO) has established several parameters to assess the adequacy of sperm for fertilization. These include sperm count, sperm motility, semen volume, and sperm morphology. Among these, sperm morphology is not the most important, as even abnormal sperm can sometimes fertilize an egg. Semen volume also does not directly affect the ability of sperm to fertilize an egg. Sperm count is important, but even a low sperm count does not necessarily prevent fertilization. Sperm motility, however, is crucial because if sperm cannot move properly, they cannot reach the egg to fertilize it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Spermatocyte motility\"}"
