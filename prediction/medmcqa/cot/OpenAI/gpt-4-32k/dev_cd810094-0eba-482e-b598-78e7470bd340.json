    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child is asymptomatic and the urine sample was obtained by mid-stream clean-catch void, which is a standard method to avoid contamination. However, the presence of E. coli in such a high concentration in the urine indicates a urinary tract infection (UTI), even if the child is not showing symptoms. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in children and does not require treatment unless the child is at risk for complications, such as those with abnormal urinary tracts or immunosuppression. Therefore, treating as an acute episode of UTI might not be necessary. Prophylactic antibiotics for 6 months is not recommended as it can lead to antibiotic resistance. Administering a long term urine alkalinizer is not a standard treatment for UTI. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be no therapy, but to monitor the child for any symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. No therapy\"}"
