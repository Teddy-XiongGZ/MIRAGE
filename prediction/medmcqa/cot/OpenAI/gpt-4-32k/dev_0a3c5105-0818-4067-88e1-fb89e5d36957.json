    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prefabricated post preparation systems are used in dental procedures to provide support for restorations. The choice between tapered or parallel and screwed in or cemented depends on the specific situation. However, in general, parallel posts are preferred over tapered ones because they provide better stress distribution and retention. Between screwed in and cemented, cemented posts are usually preferred because they provide a better seal and are less likely to cause root fractures. Therefore, a parallel, cemented post would be the best choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Parallel, partially cemented\"}"
