    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"HBs Ag positive means the mother has Hepatitis B. The goal is to prevent the child from getting infected. Giving the Hepatitis B vaccine to the child would help, but it's not the most effective method. Giving the Hepatitis B immunoglobulin to the mother would not prevent the child from getting infected, as the mother is already infected.

This would provide both active and passive immunity to the child.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
