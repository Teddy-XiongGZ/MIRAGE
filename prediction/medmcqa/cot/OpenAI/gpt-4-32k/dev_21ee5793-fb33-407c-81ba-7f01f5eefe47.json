    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition that affects the heart and lungs. It is a type of pulmonary hypertension. In this condition, the heart pumps blood so hard to the lungs that it causes damage to the lung's blood vessels. This leads to high blood pressure in the lungs. Over time, this can cause the heart to enlarge and weaken. Let's analyze the options: A. Pulmonary veins are not distended - This is true, as the condition primarily affects the arteries, not the veins. B. RV & LV walls come back to normal size - This is false, as the condition causes the heart to enlarge and weaken, not return to normal size. C. Dilatation of central pulmonary artery - This is true, as the condition causes high blood pressure in the lungs, leading to dilation of the arteries. D. Peripheral pruning of pulmonary arteries - This is also true, as the condition can lead to the loss of small, peripheral arteries in the lungs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A, C, D\" }"
