    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Submental intubation is a technique used in oral and maxillofacial surgery when there is a need for simultaneous access to the oral cavity and the airway. It is often used as an alternative to tracheostomy in cases where oral intubation is not possible or desirable. This technique is most commonly used in cases of complex facial fractures, particularly those involving the mandible or the entire face (panfacial). Nasal fractures and styloid process fractures typically do not require this type of intubation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Mandibular fracture, C. Panfacial fracture\"}"
