    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Brain death is defined as the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem. Normal BP without pharmacological support (option A) can be seen in brain dead patients as the brain stem, which controls blood pressure, is not functioning. Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation (option B) can also be seen in brain dead patients as these reflexes are mediated by the spinal cord, not the brain. Sweating and tachycardia (option C) are not signs of brain death as they are controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which is part of the brain. Decoicate and decerebrate posturing (option D) are signs of severe brain damage, not brain death.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
