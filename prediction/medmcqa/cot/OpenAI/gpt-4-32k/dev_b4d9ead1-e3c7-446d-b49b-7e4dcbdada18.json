    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Golgi tendon organs are proprioceptive sensory receptors located within tendons. They are not involved in detecting muscle length, either static or dynamic, which is the role of muscle spindles. They also do not detect muscle action. Instead, Golgi tendon organs are sensitive to changes in muscular tension and rate of tension change. Therefore, they detect muscle tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
