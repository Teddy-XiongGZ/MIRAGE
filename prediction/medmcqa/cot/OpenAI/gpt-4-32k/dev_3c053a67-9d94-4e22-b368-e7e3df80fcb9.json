    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Direct pulp capping is a procedure that is done when the dental pulp is exposed due to a trauma or decay. The goal is to preserve the pulp and avoid a root canal treatment. It is usually done in cases of mechanical exposure, where the pulp is exposed due to a trauma or a dental procedure, or in cases of pinpoint exposure, where the exposure is very small. If there is no bleeding, it means that the pulp is not exposed, so pulp capping is not necessary. However, in cases of carious exposure with more than 1 mm in size, the decay is too extensive and the pulp is likely to be infected, so direct pulp capping is not recommended.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
