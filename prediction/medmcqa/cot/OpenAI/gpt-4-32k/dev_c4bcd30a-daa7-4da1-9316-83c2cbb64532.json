    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The contractile element in a skeletal muscle refers to the part of the muscle that is responsible for contraction. The sarcolemma is the cell membrane of a muscle cell, the sarcoplasm is the cytoplasm of a muscle fiber, and the endomysium is the connective tissue that surrounds each muscle fiber. None of these are responsible for muscle contraction. The myofibril, on the other hand, is a basic rod-like unit of a muscle cell. Myofibrils are composed of long proteins such as actin, myosin, and titin, and other proteins that hold them together. These proteins are organized into a repeating unit called a sarcomere, the basic unit of muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Myofibril\"}"
