    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The RIFLE and KDIGO criteria are both used to classify acute kidney injury (AKI). The RIFLE criteria, which stands for Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease, was the first standardized definition for AKI. The KDIGO, or Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, is a more recent classification system that builds on the RIFLE criteria. Both of these criteria primarily use serum creatinine and urine output to classify AKI. They do not differentiate tubular injury based on urinary sodium (Na), urinary osmolality (Uosm), urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), or fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa). Therefore, none of the options provided are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
