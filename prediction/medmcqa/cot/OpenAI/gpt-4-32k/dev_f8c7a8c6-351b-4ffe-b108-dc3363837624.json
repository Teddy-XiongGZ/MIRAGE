    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Validity refers to how well a test measures what it is supposed to measure. In this case, the new method of measuring Haemoglobin levels should ideally give a result close to the standard calorimetry measurement of 10.2. The readings from the new method vary from 9.1 to 12.1, which shows that it does not consistently give a result close to 10.2, indicating low validity. Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure. A test is considered reliable if it would give the same result over and over again, assuming that what is being measured isn't changing. The readings from the new method vary quite a bit, from 9.1 to 12.1, indicating that it is not very consistent or reliable. Therefore, the new method has low validity and low reliability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
