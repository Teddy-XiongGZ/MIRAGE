    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The final impression tray is used to create a detailed replica of the patient's dental structure. The seating of the tray should be done in a way that ensures the most accurate impression. Seating the tray anteriorly first can lead to distortion of the impression in the posterior region due to the tilting of the tray. Seating the tray posteriorly first can lead to gag reflex in some patients. Seating the tray simultaneously in the anterior and posterior regions ensures that the tray is seated evenly and reduces the chances of distortion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
