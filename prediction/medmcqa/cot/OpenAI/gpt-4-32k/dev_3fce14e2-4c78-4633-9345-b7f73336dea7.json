    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium bicarbonate is often added to local anaesthetics to increase their effectiveness. It does this by increasing the pH of the solution, which allows more of the anaesthetic to be in its uncharged form. This uncharged form is more lipid-soluble and can therefore diffuse more easily through the nerve sheath and reach the site of action faster. This results in a faster onset of anaesthesia and a better quality of anaesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
