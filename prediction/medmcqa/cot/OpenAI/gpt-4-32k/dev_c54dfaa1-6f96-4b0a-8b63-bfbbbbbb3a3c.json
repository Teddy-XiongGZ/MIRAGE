These are all common findings in megaloblastic anemia. Reticulocytosis, on the other hand, is not typically seen in megaloblastic anemia. Reticulocytosis is an increase in the number of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) and is usually a response to anemia, but in megaloblastic anemia, the bone marrow is unable to produce enough new red blood cells, leading to a lack of reticulocytosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
