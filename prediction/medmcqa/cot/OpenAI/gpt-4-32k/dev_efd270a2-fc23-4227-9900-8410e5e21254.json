    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formula for urea clearance is C = U x V/P. In this formula, C stands for clearance, V stands for urine volume, and P stands for plasma concentration. Therefore, U must represent something related to urine. The options given are urinary concentration in gm/24 hours, urine osmolarity, urinary concentration in mg/ml, and urine volume per minute. The U in the formula stands for the concentration of urea in urine, so the correct answer should be the one that represents urinary concentration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
