    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A continuous murmur is a heart murmur that extends throughout systole and into part or all of diastole. It is typically heard in conditions where there is a continuous flow of blood from a high-pressure chamber or vessel to a lower pressure point. A. VSD with aortic regurgitation, B. Coronary AV fistula, and D. Patent ductus arteriosus all involve such a continuous flow, hence they can present with a continuous murmur. However, C. Pulmonary AV fistula does not typically create a continuous murmur because the pressure difference between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein is not significant enough to create a continuous flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
