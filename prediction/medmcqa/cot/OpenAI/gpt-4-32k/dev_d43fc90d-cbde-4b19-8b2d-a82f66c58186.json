    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) prognosis is influenced by several factors. Age of onset between 2-8 years (A) is generally associated with a better prognosis. Initial WBC count less than 50000 (B) is also a good prognostic factor as higher counts are associated with a worse prognosis. Hyperdiploidy (C) is a condition where there are more than the normal number of chromosomes, and in the case of ALL, it is associated with a better prognosis. However, certain chromosomal translocations, such as t (9 : 22), t (8 : 14), t (4 : 11) (D), are associated with a worse prognosis in ALL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
