    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Electrophoresis is a technique used to separate charged particles under an electric field. Lipoproteins are classified based on their density and mobility in an electric field. VLDL, LDL, and HDL are all negatively charged and therefore move towards the positive end (anode) in electrophoresis. However, chylomicrons are the largest and least dense of the lipoproteins and are neutral in charge. Therefore, they do not move in an electric field.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Chylomicrons\"}"
