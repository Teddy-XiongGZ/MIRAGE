    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has multiple rib fractures and is speaking in single words, which suggests difficulty in breathing. His respiratory rate is high, indicating respiratory distress, and his blood pressure is low, suggesting shock. The immediate priority in this case is to stabilize the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). While IV fluid administration and chest X-ray are important, they are not the immediate steps. Needle insertion in the 2nd intercostal space is done for tension pneumothorax, but we don't have enough information to confirm that. Therefore, the immediate next step should be to secure the airway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Intubate the patient\"}"
