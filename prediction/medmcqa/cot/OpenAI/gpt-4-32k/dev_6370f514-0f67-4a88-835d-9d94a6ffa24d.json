    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A pathognomonic sign is a particular sign whose presence means that a particular disease is present beyond any doubt. In the case of a mandibular fracture, the most common pathognomonic sign is not sublingual hematoma, as this could be caused by other oral injuries as well. Tenderness is a common symptom of many injuries and conditions, not specific to mandibular fractures. Buccal hematoma, while it can occur with mandibular fractures, is not the most common or definitive sign. Malocclusion, however, is a specific sign of mandibular fracture. This is when the upper and lower teeth do not meet correctly, which can occur when the mandible (lower jaw) is fractured and moves out of alignment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Malocclusion\"}"
