    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a study design that would be best suited to compare the fat content in the expressed breast milk of pre-term infants as compared to term infants. A case control study is usually used when the outcome is known, but the exposure is not. This is not the case here. An ambispective study is a combination of retrospective and prospective study designs, which is not necessary here. A longitudinal study is a type of observational study that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of time, which is not the focus of this study. A prospective cohort study, on the other hand, is a good fit for this type of research because it allows for the comparison of outcomes (in this case, fat content in breast milk) between two groups (pre-term and term infants) over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Prospective cohort\"}"
