    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Access cavity preparation is a procedure in endodontics where a hole is drilled into the tooth to allow access to the root canal. The difficulty of this procedure can vary depending on the tooth. Mandibular incisors have a single root and a relatively straightforward root canal system, making access cavity preparation easier. Mandibular canines also have a single root, but their root canal system can be more complex than incisors. Mandibular molars have multiple roots and a complex root canal system, but they are larger teeth, which can make access cavity preparation easier. Mandibular premolars, however, have a single root but a very complex root canal system, which can make access cavity preparation more difficult.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Mandibular premolar\"}"
