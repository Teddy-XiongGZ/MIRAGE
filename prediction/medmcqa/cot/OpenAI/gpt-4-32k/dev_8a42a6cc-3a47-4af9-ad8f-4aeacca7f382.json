    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body. They are classified based on several factors. One of these is the action on the substrate, which refers to the specific reaction that the enzyme catalyzes. Another factor is the nature of the enzymes, which refers to the type of reaction they catalyze, such as oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, etc. Coenzymes are organic nonprotein molecules that bind with the enzyme to activate it and help in the enzyme's function. Therefore, the action of coenzymes also plays a role in the classification of enzymes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above\"}"
