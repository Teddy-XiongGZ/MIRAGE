    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An avulsed tooth is a dental emergency and should be reimplanted as soon as possible. Scrubbing or sterilizing the tooth can damage the cells on the root surface that are vital for successful reimplantation. Rinsing the tooth with saline is the best option as it helps to remove any dirt or debris without causing damage to the cells on the root surface. Root canal treatment (RCT) is not immediately necessary and can be done later if needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Rinse with saline and reimplant\"}"
