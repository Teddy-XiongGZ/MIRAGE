    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Orthodontic brackets are bonded to the teeth using a composite resin. The retention of these brackets is achieved through a mechanical interlock, where the composite resin flows into the mesh at the base of the bracket, creating a strong bond when it hardens. There is no chemical interlock between the composite and the bracket base, as the composite does not chemically bond with the stainless steel bracket. Also, there is no biological interlock between the tooth surface and bracket, as the bracket is not integrated into the biological structure of the tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
