    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a normal distribution, the median, mean, and mode are all the same. The standard deviation defines the spread of the data. Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. However, this 68% includes data both below and above the mean. Since the question asks for the population between the median and median plus one standard deviation, we are only considering half of this 68%, which is 34%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
