    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is about a woman with a history of recurrent abortions. The most common cause of recurrent miscarriages is chromosomal abnormalities, but other causes can include hormonal imbalances, uterine abnormalities, and clotting disorders. PT (Prothrombin Time) and BT (Bleeding Time) are tests that measure how long it takes for a clot to form in the blood, which could be relevant if a clotting disorder is suspected. Anti Russel viper venom antibodies are used to detect lupus anticoagulant, a type of antibody associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause recurrent miscarriages. Clot solubility test is used to diagnose a rare genetic disorder called Factor XIII deficiency, which can cause problems with blood clotting. Given the information provided, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis would be the one that checks for a condition known to cause recurrent miscarriages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Anti Russel viper venom antibodies\"}"
