    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stiffness in a material science context refers to the resistance of an object to deformation. Deformation can be either elastic or plastic. Elastic deformation is temporary and the object returns to its original shape once the stress is removed, while plastic deformation is permanent. However, stiffness is more commonly associated with resistance to elastic deformation, as it is the initial resistance that a material offers to deform under stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
