    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The confidence interval can be calculated using the formula: mean \u00b1 (Z* (standard deviation/\u221an)). For a 90% confidence interval, the Z value is 1.645. The mean is given as 85, the standard deviation is 25, and the number of people, n, is 100. Substituting these values into the formula gives: 85 \u00b1 (1.645*(25/\u221a100)) = 85 \u00b1 4.1125. Therefore, the range for the 90% confidence interval is approximately 81-89.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }"
