    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PPS stands for Palatopharyngeal Sphincter, which is a group of muscles that help in swallowing. The question is asking why the face is tilted down 30 degrees during the recording of PPS. The tilting of the face down is not to activate any muscles, as these muscles are activated by swallowing, not by the position of the head. The tilting of the head down does not help in sucking and swallowing, as these actions are also controlled by muscles and not by the position of the head. The most logical reason for tilting the head down is to prevent the flow of material to the throat, which could interfere with the recording of PPS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
