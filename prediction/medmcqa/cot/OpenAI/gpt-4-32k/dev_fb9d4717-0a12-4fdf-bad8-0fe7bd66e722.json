    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why a rest on the lingual surface of a canine is preferred over a rest on the incisal surface. Let's consider each option. Option A suggests that less leverage is exerted against the tooth by a lingual rest. This is true, as the lingual rest is closer to the center of rotation of the tooth, which reduces the leverage. Option B suggests that the enamel is thicker on the lingual surface. This is not necessarily true, as enamel thickness varies and is not a primary reason for choosing a rest location. Option C suggests that visibility and access is better on the lingual surface. This is not necessarily true, as visibility and access depend on the individual patient's mouth and are not the primary reasons for choosing a rest location. Option D suggests that the cingulum of the canine produces a natural surface for recess. This is true, as the cingulum of the canine is a natural concavity that can accommodate a rest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
