    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A stenopic slit is a device used in ophthalmology to narrow the beam of light entering the eye. This can be useful in a number of tests and procedures. Fincham's test is a method of examining the eye's accommodation and would use a stenopic slit. Determining the axis of a cylinder, which is a part of the eye's refractive error, would also use a stenopic slit. An iridectomy, a surgical procedure to remove part of the iris, could potentially use a stenopic slit to help focus the light. However, corneal tattooing, which is a procedure to change the color of the cornea, would not typically use a stenopic slit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
