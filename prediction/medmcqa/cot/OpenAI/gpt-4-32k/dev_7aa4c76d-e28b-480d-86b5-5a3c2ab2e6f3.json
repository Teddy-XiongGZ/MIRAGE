    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of knee instability in full extension without instability at 90 degrees of flexion suggest a problem with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL is responsible for preventing the tibia from sliding out in front of the femur and provides rotational stability to the knee. It is commonly injured in sports that involve sudden stops and changes in direction, like hockey. The ACL is composed of two bundles: the anteromedial and posterolateral. The anteromedial bundle is tight in flexion and the posterolateral bundle is tight in extension. Since the patient's instability is in full extension, it is more likely that the posterolateral bundle of the ACL is damaged.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Posterolatilal pa of anterior cruciate ligament\"}"
