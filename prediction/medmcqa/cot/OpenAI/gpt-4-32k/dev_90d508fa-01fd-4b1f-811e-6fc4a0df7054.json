    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MO amalgam refers to a type of dental filling used to repair cavities. The question is asking what can prevent this filling from fracturing. Beveling of axiopulpal line angle (A) is a technique used in cavity preparation, but it doesn't directly prevent the fracture of the filling. Occlusal dovetails (B) are used to prevent the filling from being dislodged, but they don't necessarily prevent fractures. Pin retained amalgam (C) can provide additional support to the filling, but it doesn't directly prevent fractures. Removal of unsupported enamel rods (D) is a step in cavity preparation that can help to prevent the filling from fracturing by ensuring that the filling is supported by healthy tooth structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
