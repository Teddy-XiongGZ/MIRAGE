    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen synthesis and breakdown indeed occur in the same cell, but they are not happening simultaneously due to tight regulation. However, this does not mean that enzymes for only one of the processes are present at a time, so option C is incorrect. Steric hindrance due to albumin, option D, is not relevant in this context. The thermodynamics of the reaction, option A, is not the primary reason why glucose-6-phosphate is not immediately degraded. The key point here is the location of the enzymes. Glucose-6-phosphatase, which is involved in the breakdown of glucose-6-phosphate, is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, while glycogen synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm. Therefore, glucose-6-phosphatase cannot act immediately on the freshly synthesized glucose-6-phosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
