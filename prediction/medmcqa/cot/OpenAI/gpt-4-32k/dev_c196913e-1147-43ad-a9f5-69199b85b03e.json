    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxillary sinus is best visualized using a radiograph that directly targets this area. A lateral oblique maxilla view would not provide a clear image of the maxillary sinus. A submentovertex view is typically used to visualize the base of the skull, not the maxillary sinus. A lateral skull view would provide a side view of the skull, but it would not specifically target the maxillary sinus. The Waters view, however, is specifically designed to visualize the maxillary sinus, making it the best choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Waters view\"}"
