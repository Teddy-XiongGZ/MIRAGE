    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Topical fluoride is primarily used in dentistry to prevent tooth decay. It works by promoting the remineralization of the tooth enamel, which is composed of hydroxyapatite. When fluoride is applied, it replaces the hydroxyl group in hydroxyapatite to form fluoroapatite, which is more resistant to acid demineralization. Therefore, the primary action of topical fluoride is not to decrease plaque bacteria, form a reservoir in saliva, or improve the morphology of teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Conversion of hydroxyapatite to fluoroapatite\"}"
