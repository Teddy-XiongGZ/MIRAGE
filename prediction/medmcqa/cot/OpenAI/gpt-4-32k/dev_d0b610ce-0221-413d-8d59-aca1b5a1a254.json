    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prothrombin time (PT) is a blood test that measures how long it takes blood to clot. It is used to check for bleeding problems or to see if a treatment is working. The test is done by adding thromboplastin, a protein that triggers clotting, and calcium to a sample of blood plasma. The time it takes for a clot to form is then measured. This process activates the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, which is initiated by tissue factor (a protein also known as thromboplastin).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
