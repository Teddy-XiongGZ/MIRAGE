    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sevoflurane is a type of inhalational anesthetic. The vaporizer is designed to deliver a precise amount of the anesthetic agent. The vaporizer doesn't need to resemble the anesthetic in terms of molecular weight or oil gas partition coefficient. The blood gas partition coefficient is related to how quickly an anesthetic is taken up into the blood, but it doesn't have to do with the vaporizer's function. The vapor pressure of an anesthetic is important because it affects how much of the anesthetic can be vaporized at a given temperature. Therefore, the vaporizer must be able to handle the specific vapor pressure of sevoflurane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
