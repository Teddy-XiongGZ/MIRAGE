    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a hinge joint that connects your jaw to the temporal bones of your skull. The sensory nerve supply to the capsule of the TMJ is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular nerve (the third division of the trigeminal nerve). The facial nerve is mainly a motor nerve for the muscles of facial expression. The masseteric nerve is a motor nerve that supplies the masseter muscle, not the TMJ. The auricular nerve is not directly related to the TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
