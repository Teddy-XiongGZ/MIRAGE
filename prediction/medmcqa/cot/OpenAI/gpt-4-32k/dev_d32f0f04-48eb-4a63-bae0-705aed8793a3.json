    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of translation in eukaryotes begins with the binding of mRNA to the ribosome. This process is facilitated by the 5' cap and the poly-A tail of the mRNA molecule. The 5' cap helps to position the mRNA on the ribosome, while the poly-A tail protects the mRNA from degradation and assists in the export of the mRNA from the nucleus. The tRNA is involved in the translation process, but it does not facilitate the binding of mRNA to the ribosome. The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is a ribosomal binding site in prokaryotic organisms, not eukaryotic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Capping\"}"
