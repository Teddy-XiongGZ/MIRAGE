    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apex locators are devices used in endodontics to determine the position of the apical foramen. The first generation of apex locators were resistance based, the second generation were impedance based, and the third generation were frequency based. The fourth generation of apex locators, however, are based on the ratio of two different frequencies, which allows for a more accurate determination of the root canal length.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Multiple frequency ratio based\"}"
