    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sclerotic dentin is a type of dentin that has undergone changes due to stimuli such as caries or wear. It is characterized by the occlusion of dentinal tubules with mineralized substances, which makes it less sensitive to external stimuli. Therefore, it is not hypersensitive. Also, the occlusion of the tubules makes it more resistant to caries, not susceptible. So, the correct answer should be either insensitive or resistant to caries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Insensitive\"}"
