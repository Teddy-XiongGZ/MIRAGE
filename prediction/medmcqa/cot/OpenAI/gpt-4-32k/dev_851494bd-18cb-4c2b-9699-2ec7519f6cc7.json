    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The conversion of a monomer to a polymer involves the process of polymerization. During this process, the density of the substance typically increases because the molecules are becoming more tightly packed together. Therefore, the density should increase from 0.9g/cm3 to 1.19g/cm3. As for the volume shrinkage, it is a result of the polymerization process as well, but the exact percentage can vary. However, 21% seems too high for a typical polymerization process, so 7% seems more reasonable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
