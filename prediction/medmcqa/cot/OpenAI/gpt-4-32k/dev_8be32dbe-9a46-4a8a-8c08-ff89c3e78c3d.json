    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fetal adrenal glands are responsible for producing several hormones, but the predominant one is not oestrogen or testosterone, as these are sex hormones primarily produced by the gonads. Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone that helps control blood pressure, but it's not the predominant hormone produced by the fetal adrenals. The fetal adrenal glands predominantly produce dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which is then converted to estriol by the placenta. However, this option is not given. Among the given options, the closest one is Cortisone, which is a glucocorticoid, like cortisol, another hormone produced in significant amounts by the adrenal glands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
