    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case of a parasitic infection, as evidenced by the presence of multiple ova in the stool specimen. The size of the ova, more than 100 p in diameter, can help narrow down the potential causative organisms. Fasciola gigantica, Gastrodiscoides hominis, and Echinostoma ilocanum all produce large eggs that could potentially match the size described. However, Opistorchis viverrini produces smaller eggs, typically around 30 p in diameter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Opistorchis viverrini\"}"
