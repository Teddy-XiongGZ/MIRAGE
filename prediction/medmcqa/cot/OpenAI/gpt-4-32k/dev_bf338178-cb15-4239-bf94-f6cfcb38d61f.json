    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infants of diabetic mothers are at risk for several complications. One of the most common is hypoglycemia, which can occur because the baby's insulin production is high due to the mother's diabetes. This can lead to a sudden drop in blood sugar after birth when the baby is no longer receiving glucose from the mother. Hypoglycemia can cause seizures in severe cases. Hypocalcemia, birth asphyxia, and intraventricular hemorrhage can also cause seizures, but they are less likely in this case given the history of maternal diabetes and the timing of the seizures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hypoglycemia\"}"
