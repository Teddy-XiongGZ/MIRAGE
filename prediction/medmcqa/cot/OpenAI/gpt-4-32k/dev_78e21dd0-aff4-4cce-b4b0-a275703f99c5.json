    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Blood pressure is the force that blood exerts on the walls of the blood vessels. It is highest in the aorta and arteries, as this is where the blood is first pumped out from the heart. As the blood moves further away from the heart and through the circulatory system, the pressure decreases. The pressure continues to decrease as the blood moves through the capillaries and into the venules and veins, which carry the blood back to the heart. Therefore, the minimum blood pressure is in the venules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Venules\"}"
