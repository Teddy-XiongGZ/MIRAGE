    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cementum is a specialized calcified substance covering the root of a tooth. There are four types of cementum: acellular afibrillar cementum, acellular extrinsic fiber cementum, cellular mixed stratified cementum, and cellular intrinsic fiber cementum. Regeneration typically involves the formation of new cells, which would suggest a cellular type of cementum. However, the initial layer of cementum that forms during tooth development and regeneration is the acellular extrinsic fiber cementum, which provides the attachment for the periodontal ligament fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Acellular extrinsic fiber cementum\"}"
