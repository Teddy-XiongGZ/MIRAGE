    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a term that describes the period of regained consciousness between periods of unconsciousness. This is not describing a condition or a type of hematoma, but a symptom or a phase within a condition. Therefore, the answer is not extradural hematoma or subdural hematoma, as these are types of conditions, not phases or symptoms. The term 'lucid interval' is used to describe a period of clear, coherent consciousness experienced by individuals with certain types of brain injury, typically between periods of unconsciousness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Lucid Interval\"}"
