    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 'Last clear chance' doctrine refers to a situation where the defendant had the last opportunity to avoid the harm, which is not applicable here as the patient ignored the doctor's advice. 'Contributory negligence' refers to a situation where the plaintiff's own negligence played a part in causing the harm. In this case, the patient ignored the doctor's advice and didn't get the dressing done timely, which led to the worsening of the wound and development of osteomyelitis. The doctor did not prescribe wrong medicines, so he is not guilty on that account. 'Avoidable negligence' refers to a situation where the harm could have been avoided if the defendant had taken necessary precautions, which is not applicable here as the doctor advised the patient to get regular dressing of the wound done.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Doctor is not guilty under 'Contributory negligence'\"}"
