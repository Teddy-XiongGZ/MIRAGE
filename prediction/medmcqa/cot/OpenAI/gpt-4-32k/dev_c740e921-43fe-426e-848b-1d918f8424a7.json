    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Root canal treatment (RCT) is often required for teeth that have deep cavities or other types of damage that affect the pulp of the tooth. The most common teeth to require RCT are those that are most susceptible to cavities. The molars, especially the first molars, are often the most susceptible because they are used for grinding food and are therefore more exposed to the risk of cavities. Between the mandibular and maxillary first molars, the maxillary first molar is more frequently requiring RCT because it erupts earlier than the mandibular first molar, thus it is exposed to oral environment for a longer period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Maxillary 1st molar\"}"
