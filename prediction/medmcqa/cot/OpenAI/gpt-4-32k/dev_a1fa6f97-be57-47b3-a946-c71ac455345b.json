    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reversal lines are seen in conditions where there is a high rate of bone turnover, meaning the bone is being broken down and rebuilt at a high rate. Osteoma is a benign bone tumor, which does not typically show reversal lines. Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor, which also does not typically show reversal lines. Epidermoid cyst is a benign cyst that forms in the skin, not the bone, so it would not show reversal lines. Paget's disease of bone is a chronic disorder that can result in enlarged and misshapen bones, and is characterized by excessive breakdown and formation of bone tissue, which can lead to reversal lines on radiograph.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Paget's disease of bone\"}"
