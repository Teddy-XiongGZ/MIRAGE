    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The trapezius muscle is a large muscle that extends down the back of the neck and upper spine. The name 'trapezius' was derived from the Greek word for 'table', which is a four-sided figure with no two sides parallel. But in Latin, 'trapezium' means a four-sided figure with two sides parallel. The trapezius muscle is named so because of its trapezoid shape, which is a quadrilateral with only one pair of parallel sides.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Quadrilateral\"}"
