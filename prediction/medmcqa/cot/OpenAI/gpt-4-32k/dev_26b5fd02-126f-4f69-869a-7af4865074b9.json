    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endo-cochlear potential refers to the electrical potential in the cochlea of the ear, which is crucial for the process of hearing. It is typically a positive value, which eliminates options B and C. The standard value for endo-cochlear potential is approximately +80 to +100 mV, so the closest value to this range would be +85 mV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
