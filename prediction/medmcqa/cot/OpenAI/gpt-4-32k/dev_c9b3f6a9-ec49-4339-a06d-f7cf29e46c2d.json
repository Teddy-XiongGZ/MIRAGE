    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The working length of a tooth is the distance from the coronal reference point to the point at which canal preparation and filling should terminate. In a tooth with an open apex, it can be challenging to determine this length. Moisture on paperpoint (option A) is a traditional method but it's not the most accurate. Electronic apex locators (option B) are devices used in endodontics to determine the position of the apical foramen and thus the length of the root canal space. They are known for their accuracy and reliability. Other digital methods (option C) could be accurate but it's not specified what these methods are. Option D suggests both 1 and 2, but as we established, moisture on paperpoint is not the most accurate method. Therefore, the most accurate method would be the electronic apex locator.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
