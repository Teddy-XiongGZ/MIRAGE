    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polymerization shrinkage refers to the contraction that occurs when a composite resin (a type of dental filling material) hardens and sets. A. is true because the more surface area that is bonded, the less shrinkage will occur. B. is also true because the shrinkage is high if the composite is within the enamel margins. D. is true because the shrinkage can lead to gaps between the filling and the tooth, which can cause microleakage. However, C. is not true because acid etching and priming are used to increase the bond strength between the tooth and the composite, but they do not decrease the polymerization shrinkage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
