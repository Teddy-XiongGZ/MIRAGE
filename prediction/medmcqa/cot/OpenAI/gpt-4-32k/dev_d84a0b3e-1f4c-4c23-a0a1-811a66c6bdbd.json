    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A staghorn calculus is a large kidney stone that takes up more than one branch of the collecting system in the renal pelvis. It is usually associated with infection and can lead to serious complications if not treated. ESWL (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy) is usually used for smaller stones and may not be effective for a large staghorn calculus. RIRS (Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery) is also typically used for smaller stones. Open surgery is usually the last resort when other methods fail or are not suitable. PCNL (Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy) is the preferred method for large stones like a staghorn calculus because it allows for the removal of the stone through a small incision in the back.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
