    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transudate is a type of fluid that is pushed through the capillary due to high pressure. It is typically clear and has low protein content because the capillary walls prevent larger molecules like proteins from passing through. It is not associated with inflammatory conditions, which is a characteristic of exudate. Transudate does not have a tendency to clot because it lacks the high concentration of clotting factors found in exudate. The specific gravity of transudate is typically less than 1.018 because it is less dense than normal blood due to the low protein content.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
