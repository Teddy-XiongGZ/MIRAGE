    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a drug that is an agonist at kappa receptors and an antagonist at mu receptors. Pentazocine is a mixed agonist/antagonist opioid that acts as an agonist at the kappa receptor and an antagonist at the mu receptor. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu receptor and an antagonist at the kappa receptor, so it doesn't fit the description. Tramadol is a weak mu receptor agonist and also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, so it doesn't fit the description either. Fentanyl is a pure mu receptor agonist, so it doesn't fit the description.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Pentazocine\"}"
