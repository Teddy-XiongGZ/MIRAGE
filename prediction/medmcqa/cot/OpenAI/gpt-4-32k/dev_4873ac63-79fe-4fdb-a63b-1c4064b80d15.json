    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iron is an essential nutrient that is absorbed in the small intestine, specifically in the duodenum and upper jejunum. The process of iron absorption involves several steps and various proteins. The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is the primary transporter responsible for the uptake of iron into enterocytes. DMT-2, Ferroprotein 1, and GLUT1 are not primarily involved in iron uptake into enterocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. DMT-1\"}"
