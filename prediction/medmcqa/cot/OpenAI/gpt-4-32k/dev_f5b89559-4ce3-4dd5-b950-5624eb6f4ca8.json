    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The management of ovarian cysts during pregnancy depends on the size and nature of the cyst. Small, simple cysts (less than 5-7 cm) are common in pregnancy and are typically benign. They can be monitored with ultrasound throughout the pregnancy. If the cyst is large, complex, or causing symptoms, intervention may be necessary. However, termination of pregnancy is not usually required unless there is a malignancy suspected. Surgical intervention is usually avoided in the first trimester due to the risk of miscarriage, but may be performed in the second trimester if necessary. However, if the cyst is not causing symptoms and is not suspicious for malignancy, it may be monitored until after delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Observation\"}"
