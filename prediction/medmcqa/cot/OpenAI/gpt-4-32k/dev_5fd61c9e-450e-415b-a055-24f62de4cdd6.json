    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osteotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting and reshaping of a bone. In case of a wider osteotomy, it's important to consider the surrounding structures. Pressing the buccal and lingual plate (A) could potentially damage these structures, leading to complications. A wider implant (B) might not be suitable if the osteotomy is too wide, as it could lead to instability. Bone graft plus implant (C) could be a solution, but it would depend on the specific case. Deep osteotomy (D) is not necessarily related to the width of the osteotomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
