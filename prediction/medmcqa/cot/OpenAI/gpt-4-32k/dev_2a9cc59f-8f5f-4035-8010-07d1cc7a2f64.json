    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Schwartz formula is used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in children. The formula is: GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) = (k*height (cm))/serum creatinine (mg/dL), where 'k' is a constant. The constant 'k' in the Schwartz formula depends on the child's age and the method of estimation of creatinine. It does not depend on the child's mass or the severity of the child's renal failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Severity of renal failure\"}"
