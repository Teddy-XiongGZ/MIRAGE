The patient has uncontrolled diabetes, a history of pancreatitis, and a family history of urinary bladder carcinoma. He also does not want to take injectable drugs. Liraglutide is an injectable drug, so it's not suitable for this patient. Canagliflozin is associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections, which might not be suitable for a patient with a family history of urinary bladder carcinoma. Pioglitazone has been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer, so it's not a good choice for this patient.
