    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament is a specialized connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This attachment is made by tiny collagen fibers, known as Sharpey's fibers. Tomes fibers are associated with the dentin of the tooth, not the periodontal ligament. Elastic fibers are a component of connective tissue but not specifically associated with the periodontal ligament. Ray's fibers do not exist in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
