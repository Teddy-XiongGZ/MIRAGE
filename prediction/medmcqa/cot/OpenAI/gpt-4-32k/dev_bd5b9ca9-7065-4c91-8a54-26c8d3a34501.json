    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The young man's diet is high in protein and raw eggs, which contain a protein called avidin. Avidin binds biotin, a vitamin that is a coenzyme for several carboxylases, including pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate carboxylase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in gluconeogenesis, the process of glucose production from non-carbohydrate sources. If pyruvate carboxylase is inhibited, gluconeogenesis is impaired, leading to hypoglycemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pyruvate Carboxylase\"}"
