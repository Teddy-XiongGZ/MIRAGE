    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The venous drainage of the esophagus is quite complex. The thoracic esophagus does indeed drain into the azygos vein, so option A is true. Esophageal veins do form a submucosal plexus, so option B is also true. The lower esophageal veins anastomose with the left gastric vein, which is part of the portal system, so option D is true. However, the cervical esophagus does not drain directly into the right brachiocephalic vein. Instead, it drains into the inferior thyroid veins, which then drain into the brachiocephalic vein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
