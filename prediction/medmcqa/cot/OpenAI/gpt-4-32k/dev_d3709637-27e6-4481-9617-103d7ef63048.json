    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A homozygous parent for an autosomal recessive gene will have two copies of the recessive gene. A heterozygous parent will have one copy of the recessive gene and one copy of the dominant gene. When these two mate, there are two possible combinations for their offspring: they can either inherit two recessive genes (one from each parent), making them affected by the recessive trait, or they can inherit one recessive gene from the homozygous parent and one dominant gene from the heterozygous parent, making them carriers but not affected. Since there are two possibilities and each is equally likely, 50% of the children will be affected and the rest will be carriers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
