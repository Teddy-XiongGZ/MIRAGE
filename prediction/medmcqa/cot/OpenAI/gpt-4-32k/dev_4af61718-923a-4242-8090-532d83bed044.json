    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mesenchymal cells are a type of stem cell that can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including bone cells, cartilage cells, muscle cells, and fat cells. This ability to differentiate into multiple cell types makes them multipotent, not totipotent (which can form all the cell types in a body, plus the extraembryonic, or placental, cells), polypotent (which can give rise to multiple different cell types, but are limited in comparison to totipotent cells), or monopotent (which can produce cells of their own type, renewing the tissue).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
