    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Axonal transport is the process by which substances are moved up and down the axon of a neuron. This process is mediated by motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin, which move along microtubules. Neurofilaments, on the other hand, are structural components of the neuron and do not mediate axonal transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Neurofilaments\"}"
