    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lingual plate is a type of dental prosthesis. It is used when there is a deep lingual sulcus. A deep lingual sulcus is a condition where the floor of the mouth is lower than usual, creating a deeper space between the tongue and the lower jaw. This condition can make it difficult for a person to speak or swallow. A lingual plate can help to fill this space and improve function. The addition of anterior teeth, good ridge support, or a narrow lingual sulcus would not specifically indicate the need for a lingual plate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
