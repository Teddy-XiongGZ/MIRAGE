    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phase-contrast microscopy is a type of optical microscopy that uses phase shifts in light passed through a transparent specimen to enhance contrast. This technique is based on the principle that different parts of the specimen have different refractive indices, which cause the phase shifts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
