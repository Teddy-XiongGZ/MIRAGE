    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resistance form in endodontic root canal preparation refers to the shape and design of the cavity that is prepared to resist the forces applied during the obturation process. It does not refer to the establishment of apical tug back resistance (option A). It is also not specifically designed for the application of a condenser in vertical compaction (option B) or lateral compaction (option C).
