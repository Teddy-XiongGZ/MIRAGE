    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The purpose of washing an elastic impression with a slurry of water and stone is not to increase gel strength, as this is a property of the impression material itself. It is also not to prevent syneresis, which is a process where a gel contracts and liquid is squeezed out - this is not relevant in this context. The washing process is not primarily aimed at preventing distortion either, as the impression should already be stable. The main reason for washing an elastic impression with a slurry of water and stone is to remove any saliva or other debris that may be present on the impression, which could interfere with the accuracy of the final model.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
