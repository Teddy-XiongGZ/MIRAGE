It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women begin screening for osteoporosis at age 65. Men are more likely to break a bone due to osteoporosis than they are to get prostate cancer, but there are no standard screening guidelines for men. However, men may want to talk with their doctors about osteoporosis screening after age 70.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 65 years\"}"
