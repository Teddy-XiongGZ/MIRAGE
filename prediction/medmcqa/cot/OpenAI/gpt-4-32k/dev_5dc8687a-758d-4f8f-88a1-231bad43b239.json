    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Materials with high compressive strength and low tensile strength are those that can withstand a lot of pressure without breaking, but they are not very good at resisting forces that try to pull them apart. This is a characteristic of brittle materials. Ductility refers to a material's ability to deform under tensile stress, which is not the case here. Malleability refers to a material's ability to deform under compressive stress, but it doesn't imply low tensile strength. Resilience refers to a material's ability to absorb energy and return to its original shape, which is not necessarily related to high compressive and low tensile strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
