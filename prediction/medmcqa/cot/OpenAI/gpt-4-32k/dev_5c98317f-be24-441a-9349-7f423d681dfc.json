    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Streptococcus mutans is a bacterium commonly found in the human oral cavity and is a significant contributor to tooth decay. To isolate and grow this bacterium in a laboratory setting, a selective medium is used that encourages the growth of Streptococcus mutans while inhibiting the growth of other bacteria. MacConkey medium is typically used for Gram-negative bacteria, so it's not suitable for Streptococcus mutans, which is Gram-positive. Nutrient agar is a general purpose medium, not selective for Streptococcus mutans. Tellurite medium is used for Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Mitus salivarius bacitracin agar, on the other hand, is a selective medium specifically designed for the isolation of Streptococcus species from the oral cavity, including Streptococcus mutans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
