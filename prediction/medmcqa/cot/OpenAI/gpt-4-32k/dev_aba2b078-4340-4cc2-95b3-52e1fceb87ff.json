    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lingual nerve (A) is related to the mandible as it provides sensory innervation to the mucous membrane of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The auriculotemporal nerve (B) is also related to the mandible as it provides sensory innervation to the temporomandibular joint and the skin over the temporal and zygomatic regions. The mental nerve (D) is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve in the mandible and provides sensory innervation to the chin and lower lip. The chorda tympani (C), however, is a branch of the facial nerve and is not directly related to the mandible. It carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic innervation to the submandibular and sublingual glands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
