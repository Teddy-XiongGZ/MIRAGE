    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a neurological scale that aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person. It is composed of three parameters: Best Eye Response (E), Best Verbal Response (V), and Best Motor Response (M). In this case, the patient has eye opening to pain, which corresponds to E2. The patient is intubated, so the verbal response is not testable (NT). Abnormal flexion corresponds to M3 in the GCS scale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. E2VNTM3\"}"
