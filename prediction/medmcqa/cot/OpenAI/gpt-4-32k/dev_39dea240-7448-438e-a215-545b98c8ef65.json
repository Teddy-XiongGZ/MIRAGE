    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vestibuloplasty is a surgical procedure designed to increase the depth of the oral vestibule by changing soft tissue attachments. It involves mucosal advancement, which is the process of moving the mucosa to cover exposed areas (Choice A). It also involves secondary epithelialization, which is the process of healing and regrowth of the epithelium after the procedure (Choice C). The use of epithelial grafts is also a common practice in vestibuloplasty to aid in the healing process (Choice D). However, the use of hydroxyapatite, a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite, is not typically associated with vestibuloplasty (Choice B). Hydroxyapatite is more commonly used in bone grafting procedures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
