    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is a process that involves the breakdown of tooth structure due to the activity of certain bacteria. The lateral spread of dental caries refers to the horizontal progression of the decay. This spread is facilitated by the structures that allow for the movement of the bacteria and their byproducts. Among the given options, the dentinoenamel junction is the area where the enamel, the outermost layer of the tooth, meets the dentin, the layer beneath the enamel. This junction is a weak point in the tooth structure and is often the site where caries spread laterally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dentinoenamel junction\"}"
