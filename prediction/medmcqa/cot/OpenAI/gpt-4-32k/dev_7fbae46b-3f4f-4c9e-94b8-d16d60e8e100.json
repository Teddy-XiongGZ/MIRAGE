    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sulcular epithelium is a thin, non-keratinized layer of tissue that lines the gingival sulcus. It acts as a semi-permeable membrane, allowing certain substances to pass through. Bacterial products can pass from the oral environment into the gingiva, contributing to inflammation and potential periodontal disease. On the other hand, gingival crevicular fluid, which contains immune cells and antibodies, can seep from the gingiva into the sulcus to help combat bacterial invasion. Therefore, both processes occur.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
