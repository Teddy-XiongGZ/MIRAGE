    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Galactorrhoea-amenorrhea syndrome is characterized by the presence of galactorrhoea (milk production not related to breastfeeding) and amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods). This syndrome is often caused by a prolactinoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that produces high levels of prolactin. Apart from serum prolactin, the next investigation should be TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). This is because hypothyroidism can also cause high levels of prolactin. LH (luteinizing hormone) and hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) are not typically elevated in this condition. Urinary ketosteroids are used to diagnose adrenal gland disorders, which are not typically associated with this syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
