    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, it's important to note that jaundice is common in newborns, especially in the first week of life. This is often due to physiological jaundice, which is a normal response to the baby's limited ability to excrete bilirubin in the first few days of life. The bilirubin level of 18 mg/dl is high, but not critically high. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends starting phototherapy for term, otherwise healthy newborns with bilirubin levels between 15 and 20 mg/dl. Breastfeeding should be continued as it helps in excretion of bilirubin. IV fluids are not necessary unless the baby is dehydrated, and exchange transfusion is reserved for critically high levels of bilirubin or if the baby has signs of bilirubin encephalopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Sta phototherapy and continue breast feeding\"}"
