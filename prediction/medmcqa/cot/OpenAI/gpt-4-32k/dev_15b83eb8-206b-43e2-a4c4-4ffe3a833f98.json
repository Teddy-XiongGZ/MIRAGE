    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Light transmitting wedges are designed to transmit a high percentage of incident light. However, the exact percentage can vary depending on the specific design and materials used. In general, they are not perfect and cannot transmit 100% of the light. But they are designed to transmit as much light as possible, typically over 80%. Therefore, the answer should be one of the options over 80%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 80-85% of incident light\"}"
