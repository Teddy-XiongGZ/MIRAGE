    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An avulsed tooth is a tooth that has been knocked out. When it is replanted, it may not always integrate perfectly with the surrounding tissues. The loss of lamina dura radiographically and a high sound on percussion are indicative of a problem with the tooth's integration. The type of resorption that is most likely to occur in this case is replacement resorption, also known as ankylosis. This is when the root of the tooth is gradually replaced by bone tissue, leading to the loss of the periodontal ligament space and lamina dura.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Replacement resorption\"}"
