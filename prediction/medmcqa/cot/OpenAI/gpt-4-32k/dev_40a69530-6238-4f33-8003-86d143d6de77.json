    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iron is absorbed in the small intestine, specifically in the duodenum and upper jejunum. The process of iron absorption involves its reduction from Fe3+ to Fe2+ by a brush border ferrireductase, followed by its transport across the apical membrane of enterocytes by a transporter called Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT-1). Therefore, the entry of iron into enterocytes occurs through DMT-1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
