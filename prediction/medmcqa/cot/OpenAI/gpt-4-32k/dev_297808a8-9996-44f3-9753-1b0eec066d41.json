    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has ingested an unknown poison and is unconscious. Her vital signs indicate a high heart rate and low blood pressure, suggesting shock. Her breath smells like kerosene, which is a hydrocarbon. Hydrocarbons are lipophilic and are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, so gastric lavage would not be beneficial after 12 hours of ingestion.
