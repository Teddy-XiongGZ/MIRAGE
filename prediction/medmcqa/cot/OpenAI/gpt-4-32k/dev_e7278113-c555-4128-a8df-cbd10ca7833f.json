    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First order kinetics means that the rate of elimination of the drug is proportional to the concentration of the drug. In this case, 75 mg of the drug is eliminated in 90 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. This means that the half-life of the drug is 1.5 hours. The half-life is the time it takes for the concentration of the drug to decrease by half. After 6 hours, which is 4 half-lives (6 hours / 1.5 hours per half-life), the concentration of the drug will have decreased to 1/16 of the original concentration (1/2^4). Therefore, the amount of drug remaining will be 200 mg / 16 = 12.5 mg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
