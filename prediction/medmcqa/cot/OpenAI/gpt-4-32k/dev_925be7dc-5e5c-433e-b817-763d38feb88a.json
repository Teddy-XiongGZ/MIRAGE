    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are a heterogeneous group of immune cells that mediate the cellular immune response by processing and presenting antigens for recognition by certain lymphocytes such as T cells. Classical APCs include dendritic cells, macrophages, Langerhans cells and B cells. M-cells are also a type of APC, they are found in the gut and help transport antigens from the gut lumen to immune cells. Thymocytes, however, are immature T cells that are found in the thymus, and they do not have the ability to present antigens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
