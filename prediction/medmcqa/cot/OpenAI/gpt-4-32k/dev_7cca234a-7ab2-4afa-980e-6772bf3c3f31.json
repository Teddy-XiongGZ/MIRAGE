    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ultra speed hand pieces are used in dentistry for procedures like drilling and cleaning. They operate at a high frequency and low amplitude. This means they vibrate at a very fast rate but the range of motion is small. This combination allows for precise work and reduces the perception of pain for the patient. Therefore, the advantage of ultra speed hand piece is not low frequency and high amplitude, nor less trauma, but high frequency and low amplitude that do not let the patient perceive pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
