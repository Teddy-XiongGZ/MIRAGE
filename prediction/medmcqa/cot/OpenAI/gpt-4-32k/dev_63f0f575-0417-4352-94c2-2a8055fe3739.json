    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High copper silver alloy is known for its increased tensile and compressive strength, so option A is true. It also has greater edge strength, making option C true. The mercury content in the final restoration is indeed less with high copper silver alloy, so option D is also true. However, high copper silver alloy does not have poor tarnish and corrosion resistance. In fact, it has better tarnish and corrosion resistance compared to conventional alloy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
