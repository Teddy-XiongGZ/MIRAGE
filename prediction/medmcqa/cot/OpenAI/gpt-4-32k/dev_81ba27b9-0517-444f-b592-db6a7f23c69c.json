    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to an enzyme at a site other than the active site, which changes the shape of the enzyme and prevents it from binding to its substrate. This type of inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing the concentration of the substrate. The maximum rate of reaction, or Vmax, is decreased because fewer enzyme molecules are available to catalyze the reaction. The Km, or the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax, is not affected because the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate is not changed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Decrease in Vmax\"}"
