    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metformin is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It can cause a severe side effect of lactic acidosis, which is a buildup of lactic acid in the body. Factors that increase the risk of lactic acidosis include conditions that reduce the body's ability to remove lactic acid, such as liver dysfunction and renal failure, as these organs are involved in the metabolism and excretion of metformin. Advanced age can also increase the risk due to decreased organ function. However, smoking does not directly affect the body's ability to metabolize or excrete metformin, and therefore does not increase the risk of lactic acidosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Smoking\"}"
