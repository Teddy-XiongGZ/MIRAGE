    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maximum recommended dose for a dental X-ray operator is determined by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The ICRP recommends a maximum dose of 20 mSv per year for radiation workers, which is equivalent to 2,000 milliroentgen per year. If we divide this by 52 weeks, we get approximately 38.46 milliroentgen per week. However, none of the options provided are close to this value. The closest option is 100 milliroentgen, but this is still significantly higher than the recommended dose. It's important to note that these limits are set to minimize the risk of radiation-induced cancer and other health effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
