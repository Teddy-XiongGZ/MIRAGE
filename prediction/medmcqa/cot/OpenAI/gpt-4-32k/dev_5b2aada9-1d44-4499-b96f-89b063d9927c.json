    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactose intolerance is a common digestive disorder where the body is unable to fully digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Therefore, a person with lactose intolerance should avoid foods that contain lactose. Condensed milk (A), ice-cream (B), and skimmed milk (C) all contain lactose, as they are dairy products.
