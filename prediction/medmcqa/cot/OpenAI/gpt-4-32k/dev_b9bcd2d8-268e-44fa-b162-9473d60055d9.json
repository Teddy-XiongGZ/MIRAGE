    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Creep is the slow deformation of a material under a constant stress. In the context of dental materials, creep rate refers to the slow change in shape of a material under constant stress. The creep rate would decrease with a decrease in the force of condensation, as less force would result in less stress on the material, and thus less deformation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Decrease force of condensation\"}"
