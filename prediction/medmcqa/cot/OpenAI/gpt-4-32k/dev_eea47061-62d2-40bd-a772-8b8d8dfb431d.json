This method is used to confirm a diagnosis and reduce the number of false positives. Therefore, the specificity of the combined tests (ability to correctly identify those without the disease) increases because only those who tested positive in the first test go through the second test. However, the sensitivity (ability to correctly identify those with the disease) decreases because some people with the disease may have been missed in the first test and therefore not proceed to the second test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
