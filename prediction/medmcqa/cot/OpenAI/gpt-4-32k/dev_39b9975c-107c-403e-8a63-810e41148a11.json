    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The freeway space, also known as the interocclusal space, is the space between the upper and lower teeth when the lower jaw is in a resting position. If this space is less than normal in a complete denture, it can lead to various problems. Mucosal irritation can occur due to the constant rubbing of the denture against the mucosa. Irresistible alveolar ridge resorption is not directly related to the freeway space. Nonspecific ulcerations can also occur due to the constant pressure and irritation. Therefore, the correct answer is either mucosal irritation or nonspecific ulcerations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Mucosal irritation\"}"
