    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sickle cell mutation is a type of genetic mutation that affects the hemoglobin in red blood cells. This mutation is not a frame shift mutation, as it does not cause the reading frame of the gene to be shifted. It is also not a nonsense mutation, as it does not result in a premature stop codon. It is not a selective mutation either, as this term is not typically used in genetics. The sickle cell mutation is a point mutation, where a single nucleotide is changed, specifically, the sixth codon of the beta-globin gene is altered from GAG to GTG.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
