    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A fixative is a substance used to preserve body tissues for microscopic examination. The most commonly used fixative for routine histology is 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). This is because it preserves the tissue well without causing excessive hardening. 40% and 20% formalin would be too concentrated and could cause over-hardening of the tissue, making it difficult to cut and examine under the microscope. 10% alcohol is not typically used as a fixative for routine biopsy specimens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
