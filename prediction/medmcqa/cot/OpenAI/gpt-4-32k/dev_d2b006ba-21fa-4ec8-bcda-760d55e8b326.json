    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To protect the pulp in deep cavities and prevent sensitivity caused by acid etching, a liner that provides a barrier between the restorative material and the pulp is needed. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) liner is often used for its ability to stimulate reparative dentin formation and antibacterial properties. However, it does not bond to the tooth structure and can dissolve over time. Zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) has soothing properties but it inhibits the setting of composite resins and is not recommended under composite restorations. Varnish is used to seal dentinal tubules and reduce microleakage but it does not provide a significant barrier to protect the pulp. Light cured Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) liner is a good choice as it bonds chemically to the tooth structure, releases fluoride which can help to prevent secondary caries, and provides a good seal to protect the pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Light cured GIC liner\"}"
