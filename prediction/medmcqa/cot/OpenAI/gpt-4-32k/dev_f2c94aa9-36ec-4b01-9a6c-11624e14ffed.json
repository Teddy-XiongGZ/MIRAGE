It's important to consider the patient's overall health and the impact of the disease and its treatment on the body. During chemotherapy, the body is weakened and more susceptible to infections, so it's not advisable to undergo orthodontic treatment at this time. Before chemotherapy, the patient might already be weakened by the disease, and it's important to start treatment as soon as possible, so it's not the best time either.

Therefore, it's best to wait until the patient is in remission and has had time to recover. Two years after remission seems like a reasonable time frame for this.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
