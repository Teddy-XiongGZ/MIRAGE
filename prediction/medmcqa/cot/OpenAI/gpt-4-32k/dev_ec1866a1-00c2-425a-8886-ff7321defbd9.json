    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The focal length of the objective piece of a microscope used in ear surgery is typically chosen to provide a balance between magnification and working distance. A shorter focal length provides higher magnification but a shorter working distance, which can be impractical for surgery. A longer focal length provides a longer working distance but lower magnification. In ear surgery, a focal length of 250mm is commonly used as it provides a good balance between magnification and working distance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
