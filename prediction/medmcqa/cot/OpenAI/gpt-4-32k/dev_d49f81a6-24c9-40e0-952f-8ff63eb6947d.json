    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oral prophylaxis, which includes procedures like scaling and root planing, is generally safe and recommended for most types of gingivitis to remove plaque and tartar. Prepubertal gingivitis and pregnancy gingivitis can be safely treated with oral prophylaxis. However, in cases of ulcerative refractory gingivitis and leukemic gingivitis, the situation is different. Ulcerative refractory gingivitis is a severe form of gingivitis that is resistant to treatment and can cause significant discomfort during oral prophylaxis. Leukemic gingivitis is a manifestation of leukemia in the gums, and patients with this condition often have compromised immune systems and increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, oral prophylaxis may pose a risk in these patients. However, among these two, leukemic gingivitis poses a higher risk due to the systemic implications of leukemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Leukemic gingivitis\"}"
