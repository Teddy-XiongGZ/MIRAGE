    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, so it doesn't define the pressure in the absence of blood flow. Perfusion pressure is the pressure gradient that drives blood flow to the tissues, so it also doesn't define the pressure in the absence of blood flow. Critical closing pressure is the arterial pressure at which a blood vessel collapses and becomes occluded, so it doesn't define the pressure in the absence of blood flow. Mean circulatory filling pressure, on the other hand, is the pressure in the vascular system when there is no blood flow, such as during cardiac arrest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
