    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where the patient is 35+3 weeks pregnant with a grade 3 placenta and absent end diastolic flow on Doppler. Grade 3 placenta is normal for a pregnancy that is 36-40 weeks along, but it's slightly advanced for 35+3 weeks. The absent end diastolic flow on Doppler is concerning because it suggests that the fetus is not receiving enough blood flow, which can lead to fetal distress or even death. Therefore, waiting until 37 weeks (option B) or just monitoring (option D) may not be safe for the fetus. Dexamethasone and termination after 48 hours (option A) could be considered, but it's not the best choice because dexamethasone is typically given to promote fetal lung maturity in cases of preterm labor, and it's not clear from the question that this is a concern. The best option is to consult with a pediatrician (who can provide expertise on the potential risks and benefits of different management strategies) and then make a decision about termination (option C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
