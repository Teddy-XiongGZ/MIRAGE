    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Base metal alloys are often cleaned to remove surface impurities and prepare them for further processing or use. Warm HCl, cold HF, and cold H2SO4 are all chemical methods of cleaning, which involve the use of acids to dissolve impurities. However, these methods can also potentially damage the metal itself, especially if it's not resistant to the particular acid used. On the other hand, sand blasting with aluminium oxide is a mechanical method of cleaning. It involves blasting the metal surface with small particles to physically remove impurities. This method is often used for base metal alloys because it's effective and doesn't risk damaging the metal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
