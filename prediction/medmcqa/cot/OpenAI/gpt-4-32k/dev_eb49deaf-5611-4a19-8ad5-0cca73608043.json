    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DIC, or Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, is a condition that causes small blood clots to form throughout the body, leading to excessive bleeding. Heparin is used in DIC to prevent further clotting. Blood transfusion is used to replace the blood lost due to excessive bleeding.

However, in DIC, the problem is too much clotting, not too little, so this would not be used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Epsilon amino caproic acid\"}"
