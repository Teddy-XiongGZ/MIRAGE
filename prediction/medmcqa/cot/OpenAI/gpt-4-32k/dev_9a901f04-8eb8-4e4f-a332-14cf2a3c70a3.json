    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that provide resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin. By inhibiting these enzymes, clavulanic acid allows the antibiotic to work more effectively. Therefore, it does not specifically increase the effectiveness against gram-negative or gram-positive organisms, nor does it have any known effect on delta lactamase producing organisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Inhibition of \u03b2-lactamases\"}"
