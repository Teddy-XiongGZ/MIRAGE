    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dengue discharge protocol is based on the patient's overall health condition. Option A, '24 hours after Recovery from shock' is not a standard measure for discharge as it only indicates recovery from a severe symptom, not overall recovery. Option B, 'Urine volume > 200 ml' is not a specific indicator of recovery from dengue. Option C, '24 hours after absence of fever with use of Paracetamol' is a good sign of recovery, but it doesn't necessarily mean the patient is ready for discharge. Option D, 'Return of normal appetite' is a good indicator of overall health improvement and is often used as a measure for discharge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
