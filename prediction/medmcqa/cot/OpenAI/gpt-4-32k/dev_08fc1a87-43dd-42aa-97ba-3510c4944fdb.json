    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) is a redox indicator often used in medical and research procedures. In the context of a myocardial infarction, it is used to identify infarcted (dead) tissue. Live cells will reduce TTC to formazan, which is red, while dead cells will not reduce TTC and therefore remain unstained. In this case, the dead myocardium will not reduce the TTC and will remain its original color.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. White\"}"
