    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Giant cell tumors are indeed most common in the 20-40 year age group, so option A is true. The matrix of these tumors is made up of proliferating mononuclear cells, so option B is also true. While these tumors are benign, they can metastasize to the lungs, so option D is true. However, the osteoclast giant cells do not constitute the proliferative component of the tumor. Instead, the proliferative component is made up of the mononuclear cells. Therefore, option C is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
