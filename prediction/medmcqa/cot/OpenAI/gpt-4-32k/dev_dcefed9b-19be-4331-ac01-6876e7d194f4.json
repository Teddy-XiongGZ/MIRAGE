    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is a process that involves the demineralization of the hard tissues of the teeth. This is caused by the production of acid by bacterial fermentation of the food debris accumulated on the tooth surface. Among the bacteria that can cause dental caries, the most common are Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. These bacteria are acidogenic, meaning they produce acid. Therefore, the bacteria responsible for the progression of dental caries are acidogenic bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Acidogenic bacteria\"}"
