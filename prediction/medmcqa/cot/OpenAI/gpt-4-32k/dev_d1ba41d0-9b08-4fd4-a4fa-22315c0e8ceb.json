    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelinated nerve fibers have several distinct properties. They are covered by a layer of lipids, which is the myelin sheath, so option C is correct. The current does indeed discharge at the nodes of Ranvier, which are the small gaps in the myelin sheath, so option B is also correct. Depolarization, or the process by which the neuron sends information down the axon away from the cell body, does indeed only occur at the nodes of Ranvier in myelinated fibers, so option D is correct. However, the conduction of nerve impulses is actually faster in myelinated fibers than in non-myelinated fibers. This is because the myelin sheath allows the nerve impulse to jump from node to node, a process known as saltatory conduction, which speeds up the rate of transmission.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
