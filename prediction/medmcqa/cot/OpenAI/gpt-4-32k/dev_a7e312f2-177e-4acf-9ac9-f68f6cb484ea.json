    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Allergies are typically associated with the immune system's response to foreign substances. The immune system produces different types of antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, to fight off these substances. These include IgM, IgA, IgG, and IgE.

Therefore, in the context of chronic allergies, the relevant antibody would be IgE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. IgE\"}"
