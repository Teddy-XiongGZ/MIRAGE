    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by systemic activation of blood coagulation, which results in generation and deposition of fibrin, leading to microvascular thrombi in various organs and contributing to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). In the lab, DIC is characterized by increased PT and aPTT, decreased platelets, decreased fibrinogen, and increased fibrin degradation products (FDPs). Among these, the best indicator of bleeding in DIC is increased FDPs, as this indicates that the body is breaking down clots and fibrin, leading to a bleeding state.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased FDPs\"}"
