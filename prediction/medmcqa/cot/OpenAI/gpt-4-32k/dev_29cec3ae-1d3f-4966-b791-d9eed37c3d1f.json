    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is a comprehensive code intended to cover all substantive aspects of criminal law. The code was drafted in 1860 and came into force in British India during the British Raj in 1862. Section 228A of the IPC deals with the disclosure of identity of the victims of certain offences. According to this section, whoever prints or publishes the name or any matter which may make known the identity of any person against whom an offence under section 376, section 376A, section 376B, section 376C or section 376D is alleged or found to have been committed can be punished. These sections are related to rape and sexual assault, so the disclosure of the identity of a rape victim is punishable under Section 228A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
