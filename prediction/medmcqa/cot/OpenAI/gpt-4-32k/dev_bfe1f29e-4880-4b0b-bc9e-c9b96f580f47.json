    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Buccal coil springs are used in orthodontics to create or maintain space between teeth. They exert a constant force on the teeth, which can lead to some complications. Pain and gingival irritation are common side effects of any orthodontic treatment, but they are not specific to the use of buccal coil springs. The tendency of the 1st premolar to rotate or intrude is more specific to the use of these springs. The force exerted by the spring can cause the tooth to move in an undesired direction if not properly controlled. Among these two, rotation is more common than intrusion because the spring force tends to push the tooth out of its normal position in the dental arch, causing it to rotate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Tendency of 1st premolar to rotate\"}"
