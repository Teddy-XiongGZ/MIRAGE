    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A problem village in the context of the National Water Supply and Sanitation programme is defined by several factors that indicate issues with the water supply. Option A refers to a situation where the distance to safe water is greater than 1.6 Km, which would indeed be a problem. Option B refers to water being exposed to the risk of cholera, which is a serious health risk and thus a problem. Option C refers to a water source having excess iron and heavy metals, which is also a health risk and thus a problem. Option D refers to water being infested with Guinea worm, which is a specific health risk that is not universally applicable to all problem villages. While it is a serious issue in some regions, it is not a defining characteristic of a problem village in the context of the National Water Supply and Sanitation programme.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
