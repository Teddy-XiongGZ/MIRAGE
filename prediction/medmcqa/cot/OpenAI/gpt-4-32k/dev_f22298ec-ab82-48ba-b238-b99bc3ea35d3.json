    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An internal occlusal rest in a partial denture is a component that provides support, stability, and retention. It provides occlusal support by distributing occlusal forces along the long axis of the tooth. It provides horizontal stabilization by preventing lateral movement of the denture. It also acts as a vertical stop, preventing the denture from moving vertically in the direction of the tissue. However, it does not provide retention, which is the resistance to removal of the denture in a direction opposite to that of insertion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
