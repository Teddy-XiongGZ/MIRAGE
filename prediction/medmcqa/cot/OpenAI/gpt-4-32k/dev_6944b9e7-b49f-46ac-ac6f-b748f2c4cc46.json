    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that can be diagnosed antenatally using several methods. Alpha-fetoprotein estimation (option B) is a blood test that can indicate chromosomal abnormalities like Down's syndrome. Cordocentesis (option C) involves taking a blood sample from the umbilical cord and can be used to diagnose Down's syndrome. Chorionic villous biopsy (option D) involves taking a sample of cells from the placenta and can also be used to diagnose Down's syndrome. However, amniotic fluid volume estimation (option A) is a procedure used to assess the amount of amniotic fluid around the fetus and is not used for the antenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
