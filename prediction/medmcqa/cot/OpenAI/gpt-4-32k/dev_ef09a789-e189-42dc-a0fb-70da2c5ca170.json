    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The finish line for a crown refers to the edge of the tooth preparation where the crown will be seated. The type of finish line can affect the fit, strength, and aesthetics of the final restoration. A chamfer finish line is a sloping edge that can be used for metal crowns, but it may not provide the best aesthetics for anterior metal ceramic crowns. A heavy chamfer is similar but larger, and it may also not provide the best aesthetics. A shoulder finish line provides a flat edge that can provide good support and aesthetics for a metal ceramic crown. A shoulder with a bevel can provide similar benefits, but the bevel can make the edge of the crown less visible, which can improve aesthetics. Therefore, for an anterior metal ceramic crown, a shoulder with a bevel would be the best finish line.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
