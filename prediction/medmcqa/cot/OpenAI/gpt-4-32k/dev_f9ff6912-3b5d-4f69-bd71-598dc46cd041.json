    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a severe fungal infection, specifically mucormycosis, which is often seen in diabetic and immunocompromised patients. This infection is caused by the Mucorales fungi, which are typically resistant to most antifungal agents. However, they are susceptible to Amphotericin B, which is often the drug of choice for initial therapy. Itraconazole and Ketoconazole are antifungal medications, but they are not typically used for mucormycosis. Broad spectrum antibiotics would not be effective against a fungal infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Amphotericin B\"}"
