    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm cell development. Spermatogonia are the cells from which sperm cells originate. They mature into primary spermatocytes, which then undergo meiosis I to become secondary spermatocytes. Independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes, which is a part of the process of genetic recombination, occurs during meiosis I. Therefore, it happens when primary spermatocytes mature into secondary spermatocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
