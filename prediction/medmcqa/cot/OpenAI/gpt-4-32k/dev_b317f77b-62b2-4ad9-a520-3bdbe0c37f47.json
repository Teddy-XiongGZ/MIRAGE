    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 in India defines different types of sexual offences including aggravated sexual offences. Aggravated sexual offences are those that are committed by a person in a position of trust or authority, or under certain aggravated circumstances. Gang rape, rape by a police officer, and rape during communal violence are all considered aggravated sexual offences under the POCSO Act because they involve abuse of power or occur under particularly violent circumstances. However, rape by threatening, while a serious offence, is not specifically categorized as an 'aggravated' sexual offence under the POCSO Act.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
