    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High copper amalgam is a dental filling material that is used to fill cavities. It is known for its durability and strength. However, it is also known to undergo various types of corrosion. Electrochemical corrosion occurs due to the presence of different metals in the amalgam that react with saliva.
