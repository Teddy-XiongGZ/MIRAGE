    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, leading to an overproduction of white blood cells (leukocytes). However, an increased leukocyte count does not directly cause bleeding. Similarly, an increased calcium level in the blood does not directly cause bleeding. Platelets play a crucial role in blood clotting, and a disorder in platelets can lead to prolonged bleeding. Deficiency of clotting factors can also lead to prolonged bleeding, but this is not typically associated with leukemia. Therefore, the most likely cause of post-extraction bleeding in a leukemia patient is a platelet disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
