    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Repolarization is the process by which the membrane potential of a cell is restored to its resting state after an action potential. This process is primarily driven by the efflux, or outward flow, of potassium ions (K+) from the cell. Sodium ions (Na+) are involved in the depolarization phase, where they influx, or flow into the cell, causing the membrane potential to become more positive. Therefore, repolarization is not associated with sodium ions, either influx or efflux, but with the efflux of potassium ions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. K+ efflux\"}"
