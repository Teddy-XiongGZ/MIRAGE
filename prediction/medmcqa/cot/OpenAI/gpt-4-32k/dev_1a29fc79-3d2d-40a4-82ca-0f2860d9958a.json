    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepatitis B infection is characterized by the presence of certain markers in the blood. HbsAg (Hepatitis B surface Antigen) is the first marker that appears in the blood following infection with Hepatitis B virus. It indicates current Hepatitis B infection. HbcAg (Hepatitis B core Antigen) is not usually detectable in the blood, but antibodies to HbcAg (Anti-Hbc) can be detected. Anti-HbsAg IgG and Anti-HbcAg IgG are antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the infection, and their presence usually indicates past or resolved infection, not an active one.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
