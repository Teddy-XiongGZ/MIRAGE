    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Without a description or image of the lesions, it's difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common causes of skin lesions in infants. HSV, or herpes simplex virus, can cause cold sores or genital herpes, but it's less common in infants. HPV, or human papillomavirus, can cause warts, but it's also less common in infants. Coxsackie virus can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease, which is common in infants and could cause lesions on the face and limbs. CMV, or cytomegalovirus, can cause a variety of symptoms in infants, but skin lesions are not typically one of them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Coxsackie\"}"
