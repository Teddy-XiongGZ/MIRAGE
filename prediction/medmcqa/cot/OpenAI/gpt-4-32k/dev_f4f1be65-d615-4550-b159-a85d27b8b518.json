    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Saliva is a fluid that is produced and secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth. It contains various substances, including electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. When saliva is formed in the salivary glands and passes through the ducts, it undergoes numerous ion exchanges. This process involves the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions and the secretion of potassium and bicarbonate ions. As a result, the concentration of electrolytes in saliva is lower than that in plasma, making saliva hypotonic compared to plasma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Hypotonic\"}"
