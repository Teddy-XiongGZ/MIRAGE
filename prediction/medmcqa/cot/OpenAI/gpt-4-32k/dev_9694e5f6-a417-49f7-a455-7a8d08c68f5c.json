    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antidiuretic hormone, also known as vasopressin, is a hormone that is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland. Its primary function is to conserve body water by reducing the amount of water lost in urine. It does this by acting on the kidneys, specifically the distal tubules and collecting ducts, to increase water reabsorption. Therefore, the primary site of action of antidiuretic hormone is not the thirst center in the hypothalamus, the afferent arterioles of the glomeruli, or the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney\"}"
