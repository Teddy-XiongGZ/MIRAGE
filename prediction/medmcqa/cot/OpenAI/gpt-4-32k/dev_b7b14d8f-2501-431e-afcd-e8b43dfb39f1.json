    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-coital contraception, also known as emergency contraception, is used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. Copper-T, Levonorgestrel, and OCP (Oral Contraceptive Pills) are all commonly used forms of post-coital contraception. Copper-T is an intrauterine device that can be inserted up to five days after unprotected sex. Levonorgestrel is a hormone that can be taken in pill form within 72 hours of unprotected sex. OCPs can also be used as emergency contraception if taken in a higher dose within 72 hours of unprotected sex. Desogestrel, on the other hand, is a progestin used in some combined oral contraceptives, but it is not used alone for emergency contraception.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
