    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, the body is unable to properly use glucose for energy due to a lack of insulin or insulin resistance. As a result, the body starts breaking down fat for energy, which leads to an increase in the levels of triglycerides and VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein). This process is facilitated by the hormone sensitive lipase, which breaks down triglycerides in the adipose tissue. On the other hand, lipoprotein lipase, which is responsible for the breakdown of VLDL and chylomicrons, is inhibited due to the lack of insulin. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one that states an increase in the activity of hormone sensitive lipase and a decrease in the activity of lipoprotein lipase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
