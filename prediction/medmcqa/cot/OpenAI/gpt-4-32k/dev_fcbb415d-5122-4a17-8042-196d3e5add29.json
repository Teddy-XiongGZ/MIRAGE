    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A dentigerous cyst is a type of odontogenic cyst associated with the crown of an unerupted or developing tooth. The cyst can prevent the tooth from erupting. The treatment of choice for a dentigerous cyst is usually surgical removal of the cyst, which often involves extraction of the associated tooth. However, in this case, the tooth is a second molar, which is an important tooth for chewing. Therefore, extraction of the molar is not the best option. Aspiration of the cyst is not a definitive treatment and the cyst may recur. Observation is not appropriate as the cyst can enlarge and cause damage. Exposing the crown and keeping it exposed allows the tooth to erupt and the cyst to resolve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Expose the crown and keep it exposed\"}"
