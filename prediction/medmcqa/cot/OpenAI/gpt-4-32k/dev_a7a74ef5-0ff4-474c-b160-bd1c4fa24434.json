    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metabolic disorders are conditions that affect the body's ability to metabolize, or break down, substances, often specific types of proteins and carbohydrates. Western blot and PCR are more used for protein and DNA analysis respectively, while gel electrophoresis is a method for separation and analysis of macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins) and their fragments. Tandem mass spectrometry, on the other hand, is a method used to analyze the molecular composition of a sample, and it is particularly useful for detecting metabolic disorders because it can identify a wide range of metabolites in a single test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
