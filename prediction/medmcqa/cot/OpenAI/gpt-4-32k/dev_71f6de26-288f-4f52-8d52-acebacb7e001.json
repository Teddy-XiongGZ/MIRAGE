    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question does not provide the image of the immunofluorescence staining pattern, which is crucial to determine the most probable cause. However, I can still provide some general insights. FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) usually presents with nephrotic syndrome and is characterized by sclerosis in some glomeruli. PSGN (Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis) typically occurs after a streptococcal infection and shows a 'lumpy bumpy' pattern on immunofluorescence. Lupus Nephritis is associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and can show various patterns on immunofluorescence. Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disease that affects the kidneys and lungs and shows a linear pattern on immunofluorescence. Without the image, it's impossible to make a definitive choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unable to answer without image\"}"
