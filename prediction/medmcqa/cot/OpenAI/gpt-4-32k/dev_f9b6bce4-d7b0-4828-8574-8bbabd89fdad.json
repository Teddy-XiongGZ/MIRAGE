    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a blood circulation disorder that causes the blood vessels outside of your heart and brain to narrow, block, or spasm. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) of less than 0.5 does indicate critical limb ischemia, so option A is true. The ABI can indeed change from rest to exercise, so option B is also true. L-arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid that helps with nitric oxide production and thus vasodilation, so option C is true. However, smoking is a risk factor for both PVD and coronary vascular disease, but it's not accurate to say it has a greater association with PVD than coronary vascular disease. Both are significantly affected by smoking.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
