    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-transcriptional modifications of RNA include processes that happen after the RNA has been transcribed from DNA. These include splicing, where introns are removed and exons are joined together; 5' capping, where a cap is added to the 5' end of the RNA to protect it from degradation; and 3' polyadenylation, where a poly-A tail is added to the 3' end of the RNA for stability and to aid in export from the nucleus. Glycosylation, on the other hand, is a process that modifies proteins, not RNA. It involves the addition of a carbohydrate (sugar) group to a protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
