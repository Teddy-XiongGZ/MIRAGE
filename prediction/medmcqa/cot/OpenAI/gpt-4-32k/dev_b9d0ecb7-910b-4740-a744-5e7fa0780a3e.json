    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The oxygen carrying capacity of blood is determined by the amount of hemoglobin present. Each gram of hemoglobin can carry approximately 1.34 mL of oxygen. Therefore, to calculate the oxygen carrying capacity, we multiply the hemoglobin level by 1.34. In this case, 14 g/dL * 1.34 mL/g = 18.76 mL/dL. However, since the options do not include decimals, we will round it to the nearest whole number.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 18\"}"
