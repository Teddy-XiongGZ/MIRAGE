    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking for the 5th percentile of a normal distribution. The Z-score for the 5th percentile is approximately -1.645. The formula to calculate a value from a Z-score is X = \u03bc + Z\u03c3, where X is the value we're looking for, \u03bc is the mean, Z is the Z-score, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. Plugging in the given values, we get X = 10.6 + (-1.645)(2) = 7.31 g/dL. The closest answer to this is 7.32 g/dL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
