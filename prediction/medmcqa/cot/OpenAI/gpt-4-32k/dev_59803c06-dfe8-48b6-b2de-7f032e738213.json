    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle spindles are sensory receptors within the belly of a muscle, which primarily detect changes in the length of the muscle. They convey length information to the central nervous system via sensory neurons. This can be used to detect changes in posture. The central zone of muscle spindles does not contain actin and myosin, which are contractile proteins, so option A is correct. Type 1 nuclear bag fibers are slow twitch fibers and have low myosin ATPase activity, so option B is also correct. The peripheral zone of muscle spindles also does not contain actin and myosin, so option C is correct. However, Type 2 nuclear bag fibers are fast twitch fibers and have high myosin ATPase activity, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
