    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A buccolingual wide proximal box refers to a large cavity preparation in a tooth that extends from the cheek side (buccal) to the tongue side (lingual). This type of cavity preparation requires a special type of wedging to ensure proper isolation and to prevent damage to the surrounding tissues during the dental procedure. Double wedging and piggy back wedging are both techniques used in dentistry to secure and isolate a tooth during a restorative procedure. However, in the case of a buccolingual wide proximal box, double wedging is the preferred method because it provides better stability and isolation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Double wedgging.\"}"
