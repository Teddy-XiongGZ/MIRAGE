    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can be used to decrease intraocular pressure (IOP) in acute glaucoma. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, decrease the production of aqueous humor, thereby reducing IOP. Apraclonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that decreases aqueous humor production and increases uveoscleral outflow, thus reducing IOP. Dexamethasone, on the other hand, is a corticosteroid that can actually increase IOP, especially in steroid responders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
