    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The length of the humerus, which is the bone in the upper arm, can be used to estimate a person's height. According to the formula used by forensic anthropologists, the height in cm is approximately equal to the length of the humerus in cm times 2.7, plus 78. This formula is based on the average proportions of the human body. So, if the length of the humerus is 24.5 cm, the estimated height would be (24.5 * 2.7) + 78 = 145.35 cm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 146 cm\"}"
