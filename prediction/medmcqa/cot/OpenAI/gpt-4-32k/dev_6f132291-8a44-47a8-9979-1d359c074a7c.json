    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The larynx is innervated by the vagus nerve, specifically its branches: the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The superior laryngeal nerve further divides into the internal and external laryngeal nerves. The internal laryngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the mucosa of the larynx above the vocal cords, while the recurrent laryngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the mucosa below the vocal cords. Therefore, the mucosa of the larynx from the epiglottis to the level of the cords is supplied by the internal laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal nerves.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Internal laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal\"}"
