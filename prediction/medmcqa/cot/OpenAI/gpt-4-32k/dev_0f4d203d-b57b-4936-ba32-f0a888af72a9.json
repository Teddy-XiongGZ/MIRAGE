    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osteoblastic secondaries refer to the type of metastasis where the cancer cells stimulate the bone-building cells (osteoblasts) to lay down new bone.

While lung and breast carcinomas can metastasize to the bone, they typically cause osteolytic lesions, which destroy bone. Carcinoma of the urinary bladder rarely metastasizes to the bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Carcinoma prostate\"}"
