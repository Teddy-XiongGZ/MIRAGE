    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 72-year-old gentleman with normal renal functions who presents with new onset focal seizures. Sodium valproate (A) is a good antiepileptic but it has a high side effect profile, especially in the elderly. Oxcarbazepine (B) is also a good antiepileptic but it can cause hyponatremia, which can be problematic in the elderly. Pregabalin (D) is more commonly used for neuropathic pain rather than seizures. Leviteracetam (C), on the other hand, has a good safety profile, is well tolerated, and does not require monitoring of blood levels. It is also effective for focal seizures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Leviteracetam\"}"
