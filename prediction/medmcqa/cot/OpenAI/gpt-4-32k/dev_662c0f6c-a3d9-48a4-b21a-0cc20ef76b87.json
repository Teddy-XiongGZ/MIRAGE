    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Buffering capacity refers to the ability of a solution to resist changes in pH when an acid or base is added. In the context of amino acids, this is determined by the pKa of the amino acid's side chain. The closer the pKa is to physiological pH (around 7.4), the better the buffering capacity. Histidine has a pKa of around 6.0, Cysteine has a pKa of around 8.3, Tyrosine has a pKa of around 10.1, and Arginine has a pKa of around 12.5. Therefore, Histidine is closest to the physiological pH and would have the maximum buffering capacity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
