    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of muscle pain during exercise and the biopsy results showing excessive glycogen in the muscle suggest a glycogen storage disease. These diseases are caused by the deficiency of an enzyme involved in the synthesis or breakdown of glycogen. The enzyme deficiency in this case is likely related to the breakdown of glycogen in the muscle. Phosphofructokinase I deficiency (Tarui disease) is a glycogen storage disease that primarily affects the muscles, causing exercise intolerance and muscle cramps. The other options are also involved in glycogen metabolism but their deficiency does not primarily cause muscle symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Phosphofructokinase I\"}"
