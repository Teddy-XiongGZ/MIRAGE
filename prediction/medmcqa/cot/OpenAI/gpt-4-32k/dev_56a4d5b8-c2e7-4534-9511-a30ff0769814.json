    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute gastroenteritis is often caused by bacterial pathogens. For stool samples that need to be transported over long periods, a transport medium that can preserve the viability of the bacteria is needed. Charcol cotton bud is not suitable for this purpose. A sterilized jar would not provide any nutrients to the bacteria to keep them alive. A medium with high CO2 content is more suitable for organisms that require high CO2 levels, not necessarily for bacteria in stool samples. Carry Blair medium is a transport medium designed to preserve the viability of enteric bacteria during transport, making it the most suitable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Carry Blair medium\"}"
