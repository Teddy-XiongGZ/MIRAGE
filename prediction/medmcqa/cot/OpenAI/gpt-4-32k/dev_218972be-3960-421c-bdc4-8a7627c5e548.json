    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At 18 months of age, a child should have received several vaccines already, according to the recommended immunization schedule. The DPT vaccine protects against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, and is typically given in several doses starting at 2 months of age. The OPV, or oral polio vaccine, is also typically given starting at 2 months. The MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, is usually given at 12-15 months of age. The Pentavalent vaccine, which protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b, is also typically given starting at 2 months of age. The BCG vaccine, which protects against tuberculosis, is usually given at birth. The Rotavirus vaccine is typically given at 2 and 4 months of age. Therefore, at 18 months, a child who has never been vaccinated before should receive the DPT, OPV, and MMR vaccines.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
