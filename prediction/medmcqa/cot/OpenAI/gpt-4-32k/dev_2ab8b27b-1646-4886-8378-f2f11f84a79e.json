    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Coagulation necrosis is a type of cell death typically caused by ischemia or infarction. In the context of this question, it refers to the effect of certain acids on tissues. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and nitric acid (HNO3) are all strong acids that can cause coagulation necrosis on contact. However, hydrofluoric acid (HF) is known to cause a different type of tissue damage. It penetrates deep into the tissues, causing liquefactive necrosis, not coagulation necrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. HF\"}"
