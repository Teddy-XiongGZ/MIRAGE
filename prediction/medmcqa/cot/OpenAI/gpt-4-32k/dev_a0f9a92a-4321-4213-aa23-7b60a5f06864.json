    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) is a systematic approach to clinical problem solving which allows the integration of the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. It does depend on clinical models and decision analysis to base its recommendations (option A). EBM does objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in publications (option B). The strongest argument for therapeutic intervention is indeed a systematic review or meta-analysis of triple blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous population of patients or medical disorders (option C). However, the weakest argument is not necessarily the opinion of experts or medical boards (option D). While it's true that these opinions are not as strong as high-quality clinical trials, they can still provide valuable insights and are not considered the 'weakest' form of evidence in EBM.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
