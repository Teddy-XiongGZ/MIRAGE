    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontitis (A) and Juvenile periodontitis (B) are both gum diseases that are known to be caused by bacterial plaque. Necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (D) is also a gum disease that is associated with specific bacteria found in dental plaque. Desquamative gingivitis (C), however, is not a specific disease. It is a condition caused by the desquamation or shedding of the outermost layer of the gums. It is usually a sign of an underlying systemic disease such as lichen planus or pemphigus. The role of microbial plaque in desquamative gingivitis is not well established.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
