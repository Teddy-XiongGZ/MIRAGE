    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biomineralization is a process that involves the incorporation of inorganic substances into biological structures. This process is commonly seen in the formation of hard structures such as shells, teeth, and bones. The Pinna (anatomy) is a soft tissue, so it doesn't involve biomineralization. Honeycomb is made by bees, and while it's a biological structure, it's not made from inorganic substances. Hooves of cattle are made of keratin, a protein, and not from inorganic substances. Mollusc shells, however, are made from calcium carbonate, an inorganic substance, and are a perfect example of biomineralization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
