    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Axonal transport is the process by which substances are moved from the neuron's body down the axon to the synapses and vice versa. There are two types of axonal transport: anterograde, which moves materials from the neuron's body to the synapses, and retrograde, which moves materials from the synapses back to the neuron's body. Therefore, axonal transport includes both anterograde and retrograde transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
