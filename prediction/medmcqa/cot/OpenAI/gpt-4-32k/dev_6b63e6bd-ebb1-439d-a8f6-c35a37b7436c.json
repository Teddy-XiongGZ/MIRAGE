    "The Anion Gap is calculated using the formula: [Na+] - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]). In this case, the patient's lab values are: Na+ = 137 Cl- = 110 HCO3- = 15 So, the Anion Gap would be: 137 - (110 + 15) = 137 - 125 = 12 Therefore, the answer is A. 12 {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I identified the values needed for the Anion Gap calculation from the patient's lab results. Then, I substituted these values into the Anion Gap formula: [Na+] - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]). The calculation resulted in an Anion Gap of 12.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
