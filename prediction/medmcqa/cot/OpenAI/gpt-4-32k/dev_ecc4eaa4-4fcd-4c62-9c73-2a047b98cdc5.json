    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a decayed mandibular 1st molar involving the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusp. This suggests a significant amount of tooth structure has been lost. An intermediate restoration is a temporary solution and not suitable for large cavities. GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) is also not suitable for large cavities as it is not strong enough. Composite is a good choice for small to medium cavities but may not be strong enough for larger cavities, especially in molars which bear a lot of chewing force. A cast metal restoration, such as a crown, would be the best choice as it can withstand the forces of mastication and is durable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Cast metal\"}"
