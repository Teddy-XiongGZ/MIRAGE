    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The posterior pituitary gland is responsible for the storage and release of two hormones: vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) and oxytocin. Therefore, after resection of the posterior pituitary, these two hormones would need to be replaced. Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas, not the pituitary, so it would not need to be replaced. Thyroxine is produced by the thyroid gland, but its production is regulated by the pituitary gland's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Estradiol is a form of estrogen, a hormone produced by the ovaries, but its production is also regulated by the pituitary gland's follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Mineralocorticoids are a type of steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex, but their production is regulated by the pituitary gland's adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Glucagon\"}"
