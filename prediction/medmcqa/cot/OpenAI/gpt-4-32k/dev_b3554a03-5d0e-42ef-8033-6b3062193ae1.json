The primary treatment for this condition is surgical removal of the papillomas. Tracheostomy is usually reserved for severe cases where the airway is significantly compromised. Steroids and antibiotics are not the primary treatment for this condition. Microlaryngoscopy is a procedure that allows for the visualization and removal of these papillomas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Microlaryngoscopy\"}"
