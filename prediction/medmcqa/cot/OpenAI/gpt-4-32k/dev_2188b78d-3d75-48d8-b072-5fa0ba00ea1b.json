    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An avulsed tooth is a tooth that has been knocked out. The best way to preserve an avulsed tooth is to keep it moist. Cold milk is often recommended because it has the right balance of acid to alkaline and the right amount of sugar for the cells in the tooth to survive. Normal saline is also a good option, but it might not be readily available. Wrapping the tooth in a wet handkerchief is not ideal because it might not keep the tooth sufficiently moist. Placing the tooth in the buccal vestibule is not recommended because it could be swallowed or inhaled.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cold milk\"}"
