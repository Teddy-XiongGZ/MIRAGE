    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apex locators are devices used in endodontics to determine the position of the apical foramen. They have evolved over time, with each generation improving on the last. The first generation used resistance, the second generation used impedance, the third generation used multiple frequencies, and the fourth generation used multiple frequencies and also accounted for canal conditions. Therefore, the impedance-based apex locator is the second generation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
