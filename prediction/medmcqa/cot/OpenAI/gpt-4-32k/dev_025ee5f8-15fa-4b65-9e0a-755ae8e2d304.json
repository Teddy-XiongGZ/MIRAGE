    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A molecule with a permanent dipole has a separation of charge. This means that one part of the molecule is slightly negative, while the other part is slightly positive. Oxygen and helium are both diatomic molecules with identical atoms, so they are nonpolar and do not have a permanent dipole. Liquid nitrogen is also a diatomic molecule with identical atoms, so it does not have a permanent dipole. Water, however, is a polar molecule because the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, creating a separation of charge and a permanent dipole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Water\"}"
