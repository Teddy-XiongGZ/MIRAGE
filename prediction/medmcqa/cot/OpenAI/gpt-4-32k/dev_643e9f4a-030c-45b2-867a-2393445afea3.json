    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gentamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to an abnormal production of proteins. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase, preventing DNA replication. Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that inhibits cell wall synthesis in gram-positive bacteria by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of the cell wall precursor, preventing its incorporation into the growing peptidoglycan chain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
