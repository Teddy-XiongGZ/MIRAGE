    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart condition that is characterized by four anatomical abnormalities of the heart. One of the main symptoms is cyanotic spells, which are episodes of bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels in the blood. These spells are often triggered by crying, feeding, or defecation in infants. The goal of treatment during a cyanotic spell is to increase systemic vascular resistance and decrease right to left shunting, thus improving oxygenation. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, can help to decrease heart rate and contractility, which can improve oxygenation. Phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor, can increase systemic vascular resistance, which can also improve oxygenation. Sodium bicarbonate can help to correct metabolic acidosis, which can occur during a cyanotic spell. Isoprenaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, can increase heart rate and contractility, which can worsen right to left shunting and exacerbate cyanosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Isoprenaline\"}"
