    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelopathy refers to any neurologic deficit related to the spinal cord. When it comes to the symptoms, they can vary widely depending on the level of the spinal cord that is affected. Symptoms can include motor deficits such as weakness, sensory deficits such as numbness or tingling, and autonomic dysfunction such as urinary urgency or incontinence. However, the facial area and jaw are innervated by cranial nerves, not the spinal cord. Therefore, sensory loss in the facial area and a brisk jaw jerk would not be symptoms of myelopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Sensory loss of facial area\"}"
