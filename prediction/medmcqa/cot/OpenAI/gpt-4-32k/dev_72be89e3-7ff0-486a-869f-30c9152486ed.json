    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Root fractures in the apical third of permanent anterior teeth are usually associated with a good prognosis. This is because the apical third of the root is often surrounded by dense bone, which provides good support and stability for the tooth. The blood supply to the pulp is also usually maintained, which means the tooth can remain vital and functional. Therefore, the tooth does not typically discolor rapidly, undergo pulp necrosis and become ankylosed, or need to be extracted and replaced with a prosthetic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
