    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypotension is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia. This is because the anesthetic blocks nerve impulses from the autonomic nervous system that regulate blood pressure. The sudden onset of hypotension after administration of the anesthetic suggests that it is not due to systemic absorption of the drug, which would take longer to occur. A vasovagal effect could cause hypotension, but this is usually associated with emotional stress or pain, which would not be present under anesthesia. An allergy to the drug preparation could cause hypotension, but this would likely be accompanied by other symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as rash or difficulty breathing. Penetration into the subarachnoid space could cause a sudden drop in blood pressure due to the rapid onset of spinal anesthesia, which blocks nerve impulses to a larger portion of the body than epidural anesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Penetration into the subarachnoid space\"}"
