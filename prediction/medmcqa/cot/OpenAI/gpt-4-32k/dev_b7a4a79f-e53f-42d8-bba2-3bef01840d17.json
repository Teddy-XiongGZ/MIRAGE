It is not a definite genetic disease, although there may be a genetic predisposition in some cases. It is not an immunological defect per se, but it does involve the immune system's response to bacterial infection in the gums. The disease is characterized by a rapid loss of bone and attachment, and is associated with highly virulent microbial biofilms, often including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The key factor in the pathogenesis of this disease is the dysfunction of neutrophils, specifically, a defect in the chemotaxis of neutrophils.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
