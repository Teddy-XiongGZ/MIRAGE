    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation causes cell death by damaging the DNA within the cells. This is achieved through a process called ionization, where radiation energy is absorbed by the atoms in the cells, causing them to lose electrons and become ions. This ionization process can directly damage DNA or create free radicals that can indirectly damage DNA. The other options, such as charring of nucleoproteins, destroying their mitochondria, and disruption of cytosol, are not the primary mechanisms by which radiation causes cell death.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Ionization\"}"
