    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amalgam fillings are made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin, copper and mercury. The mercury is used to bind the metals together and to provide a strong, hard, durable filling. If there is an increase in the residual mercury in the amalgam filling, it can lead to a decrease in the strength of the filling, making it more prone to fracture. It can also lead to tarnish and corrosion of the filling. However, it does not increase the strength of the filling or decrease the condensation pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cause fracture of the filling, B. Tarnish and corrosion\"}"
