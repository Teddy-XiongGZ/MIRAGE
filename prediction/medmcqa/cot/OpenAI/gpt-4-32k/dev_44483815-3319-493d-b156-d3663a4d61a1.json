This includes people with certain health conditions like sickle cell disease. It is not recommended for children under 2 years because they do not respond consistently to polysaccharide antigens. While it can be used in patients with cystic fibrosis and recurrent otitis media & sinusitis, it is most beneficial in patients with sickle cell disease because they are at a higher risk for invasive pneumococcal disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
