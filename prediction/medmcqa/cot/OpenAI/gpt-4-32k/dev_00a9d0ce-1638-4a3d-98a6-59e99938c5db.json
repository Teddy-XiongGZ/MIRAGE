    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pilocarpine is a muscarinic receptor agonist, which means it mimics the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors. It is used to constrict the pupil (sphincter pupillae). The dilator pupillae, on the other hand, is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, which uses norepinephrine as its neurotransmitter. Therefore, we are looking for a drug that mimics the action of norepinephrine. Among the options, epinephrine is the most similar to norepinephrine and would have a similar effect on the dilator pupillae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Epinephrine\"}"
