    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, and it can be exacerbated by certain types of anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia, for example, can potentially worsen MS symptoms. Parenteral opioids and inhalational analgesia are not typically used as the primary method of anesthesia for childbirth due to their potential side effects on both the mother and the baby. Neuraxial analgesia, which includes epidural, spinal, and combined spinal-epidural blocks, is commonly used in childbirth. However, in this case, considering the patient's MS condition, the best choice would be neuraxial analgesia that avoids spinal anesthesia, such as an epidural block.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Neuraxial analgesia\"}"
