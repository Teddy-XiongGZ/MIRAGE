    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a case of Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder that results in an inability to metabolize phenylalanine due to a defect in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This leads to a buildup of phenylalanine in the body, which can cause mental retardation if not treated. The Guthrie test, which is positive in this case, is used to screen for PKU. Phenyl acetate can be found in the urine of patients with PKU. However, the statement about a white patch of hair due to tryptophan deficiency is not related to PKU. Tryptophan deficiency can lead to hair depigmentation, but it is not a characteristic of PKU.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
