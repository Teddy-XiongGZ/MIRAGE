    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Condensation pressure is the pressure required to pack the amalgam into the cavity. The type of alloy and its shape can affect the amount of condensation pressure required. Spherical amalgam alloys require the least condensation pressure because the spherical particles can slide past each other more easily than other shapes. High copper amalgams are stronger and have better corrosion resistance than low copper amalgams, but this does not affect the condensation pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
