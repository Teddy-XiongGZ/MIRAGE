    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose without the presence of oxygen. This process is common in many cells, especially those that are in conditions where oxygen is scarce. The process of anaerobic glycolysis of glucose typically yields 2 ATPs. However, when glycogen is used as the starting molecule, one ATP is saved during the initial phosphorylation step, resulting in a net gain of 3 ATPs. Amino acids, fructose, and galactose do not have this same advantage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Glycogen\"}"
