    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement are both dental cements used in dentistry. Polyacrylic acid is a component of polycarboxylate cement, not zinc oxide eugenol cement, so option A is incorrect. Eugenol is a component of zinc oxide eugenol cement, not polycarboxylate cement, so option D is incorrect. Both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement can chemically bond to tooth structure, so option B is a possibility. Chelation is a type of bonding that occurs in polycarboxylate cement, but not in zinc oxide eugenol cement, so option C is incorrect. Therefore, the common feature between the two is their ability to chemically bond to tooth structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
