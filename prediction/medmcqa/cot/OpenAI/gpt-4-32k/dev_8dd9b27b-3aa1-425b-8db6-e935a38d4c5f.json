    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiamine is a cofactor for several enzymes. It is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids. Alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase are all enzymes that require thiamine as a cofactor. However, succinate dehydrogenase, which is part of the citric acid cycle, does not require thiamine as a cofactor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Succinate dehydrogenase\"}"
