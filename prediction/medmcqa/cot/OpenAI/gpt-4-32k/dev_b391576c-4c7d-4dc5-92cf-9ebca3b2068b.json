    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The bone consists of several layers, including the periosteum, endosteum, cancellous bone, and cortical bone. The periosteum is the outer layer of the bone, which contains blood vessels and nerves. The endosteum is the inner layer of the bone, which contains osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone formation and resorption. The cancellous bone, also known as spongy bone, is found at the ends of long bones and in the inner layer of flat bones. The cortical bone, also known as compact bone, is the hard outer layer of bones. Among these, the endosteum is the most metabolically active layer because it contains the cells responsible for bone turnover.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Endosteum\"}"
