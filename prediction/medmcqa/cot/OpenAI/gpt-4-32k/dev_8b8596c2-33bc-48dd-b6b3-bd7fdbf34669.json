    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pelvic inlet has several diameters. The true conjugate is the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet, measured from the upper part of the symphysis pubis to the sacral promontory. The obstetric conjugate is the diameter from the middle of the sacral promontory to a point on the posterior surface of the symphysis pubis approximately 1.5 cm below the upper margin. The anatomical conjugate is the diameter from the upper margin of the symphysis pubis to the sacral promontory. The bispinous diameter is the transverse diameter of the pelvic inlet. Among these, the shortest anteroposterior diameter is the obstetric conjugate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Obstetric conjugate\"}"
