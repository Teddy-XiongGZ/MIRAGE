    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sensitivity in the gingival area of a class II light cured composite restoration after 2 months could be due to several factors. However, looking at the options, improper cavity preparation at the gingival margin (option A) could lead to sensitivity due to exposure of dentin or pulp. Curing from the occlusal area only (option B) could also lead to sensitivity if the composite is not fully cured, especially in the gingival area. The addition of resin in multiple increments (option C) is a standard procedure and should not cause sensitivity if done correctly. Curing from the buccal and lingual aspect (option D) is also a standard procedure and should not cause sensitivity if done correctly. Therefore, the most likely cause of sensitivity in this case would be either improper cavity preparation or inadequate curing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Curing from occlusal area only\"}"
