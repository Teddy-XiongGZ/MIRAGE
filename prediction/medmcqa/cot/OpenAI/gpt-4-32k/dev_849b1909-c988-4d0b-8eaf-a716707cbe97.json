    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that originate from the neck and supply the upper limb. It is formed by the ventral rami of the C5-T1 spinal nerves and is divided into roots, trunks, divisions, and cords. The roots give off branches to the muscles of the neck, the trunks give off branches to the shoulder and arm, and the cords give off branches to the forearm and hand. The divisions, however, do not give off any branches.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Division\"}"
