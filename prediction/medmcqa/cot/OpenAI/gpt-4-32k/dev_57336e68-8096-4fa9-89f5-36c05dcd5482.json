    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mixed dentition analysis is a method used to predict the size of unerupted permanent teeth using the sizes of erupted permanent and/or primary teeth. Carey's analysis, Moyer's analysis, and Nance Carey's analysis all require the use of radiographs to measure the size of unerupted teeth. However, Pont's index is based on the mesiodistal width of the six maxillary anterior teeth, which can be measured directly in the mouth without the use of radiographs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
