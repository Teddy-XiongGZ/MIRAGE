    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aortic stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve narrows, restricting blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and potentially to the rest of the body. This can cause a variety of symptoms and physical signs. A late peaking holosystolic murmur is more indicative of mitral regurgitation. A diastolic rumble is typically associated with mitral stenosis. An opening snap is also a sign of mitral stenosis. A delayed carotid upstroke, however, is a classic physical sign of severe aortic stenosis. It occurs because the stenotic aortic valve impedes the normal rapid ejection of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta, causing a delayed rise in the carotid pulse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
