    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Arch length discrepancy in dentistry refers to the difference between the space available in the dental arch and the space required for the proper alignment of the teeth. A discrepancy of more than 10 mm is quite significant and usually indicates a severe crowding problem. This cannot be resolved without extraction of teeth to create more space. Early treatment or proximal stripping would not be sufficient to resolve such a large discrepancy. Therefore, extraction of teeth, specifically posterior teeth, is usually required.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
