    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The incisal embrasure is the space that is present between the teeth, above or below the contact area. The size of the incisal embrasure increases from the midline towards the posterior. Therefore, the largest incisal embrasure is not going to be between the central and lateral incisors, whether upper or lower. It is more likely to be between the canine and the premolar. However, the upper canine and premolar have a larger incisal embrasure than the lower canine and premolar due to the larger size and shape of the upper canine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Between upper canine and premolar\"}"
