    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Interstitial fluid is the fluid that resides in the space between the cells, which makes up about 16% of the total body weight. To measure the volume of interstitial fluid, we need to use a substance that can freely distribute in the extracellular fluid but not enter the cells. Radiolabelled albumin is a good choice because it remains in the vascular and interstitial compartments and does not enter cells. On the other hand, radiolabelled water can distribute freely throughout the body, including both intracellular and extracellular compartments. Therefore, the combination of radiolabelled water and radiolabelled albumin can be used to determine the volume of interstitial fluid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Radioactive water and radiolabelled albumin\"}"
