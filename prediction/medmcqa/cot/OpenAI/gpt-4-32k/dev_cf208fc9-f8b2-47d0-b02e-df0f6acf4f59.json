    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pulp of the tooth is a highly vascularized and innervated tissue in the center of the tooth. It contains both sensory and autonomic nerve fibers. The sensory fibers are responsible for transmitting pain, temperature, and pressure sensations. The autonomic fibers, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, regulate blood flow and secretory activity within the pulp. Therefore, the nerve fibers in the pulp are not just sympathetic or parasympathetic, but a combination of both.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Both autonomic parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres\"}"
