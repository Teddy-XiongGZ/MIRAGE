    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ear lobule is a part of the external ear. The greater auricular nerve is a branch of the cervical plexus, supplying sensation to the skin over both the parotid gland and the earlobe. The lesser occipital nerve, also a branch of the cervical plexus, supplies the scalp above and behind the ear. The facial nerve is primarily a motor nerve for facial expression, but it also carries some sensory information from the ear. The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve, supplies sensory innervation to various regions on the side of the head, but not the earlobe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
