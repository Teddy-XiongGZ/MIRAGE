    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a drug that binds to a receptor and activates it, which then brings about an effect. An inverse agonist would bind to the receptor but induce the opposite effect of activation. An antagonist would bind to the receptor but block its activation. A partial agonist would bind to the receptor and partially activate it. An agonist, however, would bind to the receptor and fully activate it, bringing about the desired effect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Agonist\"}"
