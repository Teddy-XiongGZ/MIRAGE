    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The adrenal gland is composed of two parts: the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex is primarily an endocrine gland, producing several types of hormones. The adrenal medulla, on the other hand, functions similarly to a sympathetic ganglion and is innervated by preganglionic sympathetic fibers. Therefore, it does have a nerve supply. The release of catecholamines, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, from the adrenal medulla is indeed affected by nerve supply. The preganglionic fibers that innervate the adrenal medulla originate from the thoracic spinal cord, not the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
