    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lalloo's severe thumb-sucking habit has led to a Class-II malocclusion, anterior open bite, and an over-jet of 12mm. These are all signs of an abnormal jaw relationship, specifically an overgrowth of the upper jaw or a backward position of the lower jaw. This would likely result in an increased anterior facial height. The posterior facial height, which is related to the lower jaw and the back of the skull, is not directly affected by thumb-sucking habits, so it should be normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increased anterior facial height and normal posterior facial height\"}"
