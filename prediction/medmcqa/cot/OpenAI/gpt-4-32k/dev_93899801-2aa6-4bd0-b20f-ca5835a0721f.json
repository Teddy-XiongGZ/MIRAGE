    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a patient with oral and maxillofacial trauma, cervical injury is a concern. The primary goal is to secure the airway while minimizing movement of the cervical spine. Normal laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation (option C) may require significant neck movement and thus is not the best choice. LMA (option A) and Combitube (option B) are also not ideal as they do not provide the most secure airway. Fiberoptic intubation (option D), on the other hand, allows for visualization of the airway and can be performed with minimal neck movement, making it the safest and most effective option in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
