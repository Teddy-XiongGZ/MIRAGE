    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The strength of association between a risk factor and a disease is typically measured by the odds ratio or relative risk. Attributable risk is the difference in rate of a condition between an exposed population and an unexposed population. Absolute risk of the variable is the probability that a particular event will occur in a specific group. P-value is used in hypothesis testing to help you support or reject the null hypothesis. It represents the probability that the results of your test occurred at random. Therefore, the best answer is the odds ratio/relative risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Odds ratio/Relative risk\"}"
