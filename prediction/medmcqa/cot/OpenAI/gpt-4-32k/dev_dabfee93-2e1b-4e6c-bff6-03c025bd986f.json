    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lenticonus is a condition where the lens of the eye bulges, causing vision problems. This condition is often associated with Alport syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. The fact that the patient's maternal uncle also died of the same illness suggests a genetic disorder. Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease are characterized by the development of numerous cysts in the kidneys, but they do not typically present with lenticonus. Oxalosis is a metabolic disorder that can lead to kidney stones and kidney failure, but it also does not typically present with lenticonus. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Alport syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
