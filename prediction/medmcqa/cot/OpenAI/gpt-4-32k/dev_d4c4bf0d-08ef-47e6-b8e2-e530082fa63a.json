    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Narrow angle glaucoma is a type of glaucoma that can be precipitated by medications that dilate the pupils, known as mydriatics. Phenylephrine is a decongestant and does not typically affect the pupils. Timolol and Acetazolamide are both used in the treatment of glaucoma, so they would not precipitate an attack. Homatropine, however, is a mydriatic and could potentially precipitate an attack of narrow angle glaucoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Homatropine\"}"
