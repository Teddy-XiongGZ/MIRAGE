    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones. This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. The features of Apert syndrome include bicoronal craniosynostosis, which is the premature fusion of the skull bones, midface hypoplasia, which is underdevelopment of the midface, and complex syndactyly, which is the fusion of fingers or toes. However, mandibular hypoplasia, or underdevelopment of the lower jaw, is not a typical feature of Apert syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
