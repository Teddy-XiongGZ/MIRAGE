    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epistaxis, or nosebleeds, are often caused by the rupture of small blood vessels in the nose. The blood vessels that are commonly involved in epistaxis are the maxillary artery, anterior ethmoidal artery, and external carotid artery, as they supply blood to the nasal area. The internal carotid artery, on the other hand, supplies blood to the brain and is not typically involved in epistaxis. Therefore, it would not be ligated in the control of epistaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Internal carotid aery\"}"
