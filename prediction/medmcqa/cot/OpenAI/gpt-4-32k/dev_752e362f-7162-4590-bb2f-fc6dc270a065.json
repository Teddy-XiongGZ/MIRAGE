ED-1 is associated with X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, not specifically with cleft lip and palate. GJB6 is associated with deafness, not ectodermal dysplasia. R P73 is a gene associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. PVRL1, also known as Nectin-1, is the gene associated with ectodermal dysplasia with cleft lip and palate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. PVRL1\"}"
