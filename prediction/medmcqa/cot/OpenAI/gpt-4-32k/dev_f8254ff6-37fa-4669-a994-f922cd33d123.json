    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxillary posterior area is a high-stress area, so the pontic should be strong and durable. A sanitary pontic is designed to allow easy cleaning and is often used in the anterior region, not the posterior. Flat back pontic with porcelain facing is more aesthetic and is also typically used in the anterior region. Trupontic or long pin pontic is not commonly used. Pin facing pontic is strong and durable, making it suitable for the high-stress maxillary posterior area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Pin facing pontic\"}"
