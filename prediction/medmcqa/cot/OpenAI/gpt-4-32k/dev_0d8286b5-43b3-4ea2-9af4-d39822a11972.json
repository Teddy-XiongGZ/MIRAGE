    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dry heat destroys microorganisms by oxidizing their cellular components. This process involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from organic compounds, which leads to the breakdown of the cell structure and ultimately, the death of the microorganism. Lysis, hydrolysis of DNA, and coagulation of proteins are not the primary mechanisms of action for dry heat.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
