    "The net filtration pressure (NFP) is calculated by the difference between the forces favoring filtration and the forces opposing filtration. The forces favoring filtration are the capillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP) and the interstitial oncotic pressure (IOP). The forces opposing filtration are the capillary oncotic pressure (COP) and the interstitial hydrostatic pressure (IHP). The formula for NFP is: NFP = (CHP + IOP) - (COP + IHP) Given in the question, we have: CHP = 25 mm Hg IOP = 7 mm Hg IHP = 2 mm Hg NFP = 3 mm Hg We need to find the COP. So, we rearrange the formula to solve for COP: COP = (CHP + IOP) - (NFP + IHP) Substituting the given values: COP = (25 + 7) - (3 + 2) = 27 mm Hg So, the capillary oncotic pressure should be 27 mm Hg to allow a net filtration pressure of 3 mm Hg. Therefore, the answer is D. 27. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I used the formula for net filtration pressure to understand the relationship between the different pressures. Then, I rearranged the formula to solve for the capillary oncotic pressure. Finally, I substituted the given values into the formula to find the capillary oncotic pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
