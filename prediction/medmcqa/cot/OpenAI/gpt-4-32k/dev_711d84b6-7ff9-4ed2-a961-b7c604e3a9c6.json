    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pro-root MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate) is a dental material used in endodontic procedures. Its major drawback is its increased setting time. The setting time of MTA can be decreased by the addition of certain substances. Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and Sodium Chloride (NaCl) are not typically used to decrease the setting time of MTA. Distilled water is used to mix MTA but it doesn't decrease the setting time. Calcium Chloride (CaCl) is known to accelerate the setting time of MTA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 5% CaCl\"}"
