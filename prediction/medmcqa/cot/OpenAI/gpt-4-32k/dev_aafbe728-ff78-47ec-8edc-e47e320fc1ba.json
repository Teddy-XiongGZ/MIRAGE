    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The potential generated due to the movement of freely diffusible ions across a semi-permeable membrane is a fundamental concept in physiology, particularly in understanding the electrical properties of cells. The Nernst equation is used to calculate the equilibrium potential for a single ion. The Gibbs equation is used in thermodynamics, not in calculating membrane potentials. The Fick principle is used to calculate cardiac output. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation is used to calculate the membrane potential that results from the contribution of all ions that can cross the membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation\"}"
