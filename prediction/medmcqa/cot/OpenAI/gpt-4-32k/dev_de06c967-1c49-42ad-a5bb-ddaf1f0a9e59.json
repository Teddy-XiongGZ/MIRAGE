    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The vasomotor reversal of Dale is a phenomenon where the effect of a drug on the blood vessels can be reversed by a second drug. In this case, the first drug would cause vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) and the second drug would cause vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels). Alpha-1 receptors, when stimulated, cause vasoconstriction. Beta-2 receptors, when stimulated, cause vasodilation. Therefore, to demonstrate vasomotor reversal of Dale, we would first need to stimulate the alpha-1 receptor to cause vasoconstriction, and then stimulate the beta-2 receptor to cause vasodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
