    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentinal caries is a type of tooth decay that affects the dentin, the layer of the tooth beneath the enamel. The bacteria free zone of dentinal caries is the area where bacteria have not yet reached. The zone of decomposed dentin and zone of bacterial invasion are areas where bacteria are present, so they can't be the bacteria free zone. The zone of decalcification is where the tooth's minerals have been dissolved by the acids produced by bacteria, so bacteria are present there too. The zone of dentinal sclerosis is a defense mechanism of the tooth where the dentinal tubules are occluded to prevent the spread of bacteria and their toxins. Therefore, this is the bacteria free zone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Zone of dentinal sclerosis\"}"
