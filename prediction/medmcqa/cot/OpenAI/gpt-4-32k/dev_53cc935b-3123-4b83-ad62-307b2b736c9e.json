    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the depth of blistering disorders. The disorders listed are all types of pemphigus or pemphigoid conditions, which are autoimmune skin disorders that cause blisters. IgA pemphigus and Bullous pemphigoid are superficial blistering disorders, meaning they affect the upper layers of the skin. PV, or Pemphigus Vulgaris, is a deep blistering disorder, affecting the deeper layers of the skin. EBD, or Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica, is also a deep blistering disorder, but it is generally considered to be deeper than PV because it affects the basement membrane zone, which is the deepest part of the epidermis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. EBD\"}"
