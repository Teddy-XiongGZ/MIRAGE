    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Accessory canals are additional canals that may be present in a tooth, apart from the main root canals. They are usually found at the junction of the pulp chamber and the root (furcation area) or along the root of the tooth (lateral area). However, the pattern of these accessory canals can vary greatly among individuals and even among different teeth in the same individual. Therefore, it is not possible to define a 'major pattern' for accessory canals in mandibular molars that would apply to all or most cases. Furthermore, the pattern of accessory canals does not depend on the age of the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Variable pattern & depend on age of patient\"}"
