    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The skin and the mucosa of the cheek are different in several ways. The skin is keratinized, meaning it has a layer of dead cells on the surface that provides protection. The mucosa of the cheek, on the other hand, is non-keratinized, meaning it does not have this protective layer. The skin also has a thick lamina propria, which is a layer of connective tissue that provides support and nourishment. The mucosa of the cheek does not have this thick layer. Rete pegs are extensions of the epidermis into the dermis and are not a distinguishing feature between skin and mucosa. Therefore, the difference between the skin and mucosa of the cheek is that the skin has a thick lamina propria and is keratinized, while the mucosa is thin and non-keratinized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
