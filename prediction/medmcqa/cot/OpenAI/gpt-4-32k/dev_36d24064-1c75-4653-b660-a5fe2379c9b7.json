    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A non-reactive non-stress test (NST) in a pregnant woman indicates that the fetus may not be getting enough oxygen. However, a non-reactive NST doesn't always mean there's a problem. It could be that the baby was asleep during the test. Therefore, it's not necessary to immediately induce labour or perform a cesarean section (CS). Repeating the NST after 1 hour could be an option, but it's better to proceed to a more comprehensive test. A biophysical profile (BPP) is a prenatal ultrasound evaluation of fetal well-being involving a scoring system, with the NST as one component. It also includes fetal movement, fetal tone, fetal breathing, and amniotic fluid volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Proceed to biophysical profile\"}"
