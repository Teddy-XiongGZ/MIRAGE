    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a specific type of cry that is loud, high pitched, and siren-like. Obstinate cry is usually associated with stubbornness or resistance, which doesn't necessarily imply a high-pitched, siren-like wail. Frighten cry could be high pitched, but it's not necessarily loud or siren-like. A hurt cry could be loud and high pitched, but it's not typically described as siren-like. Compensatory cry is not a commonly used term in this context and doesn't provide enough information to be considered the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hurt cry.\"}"
