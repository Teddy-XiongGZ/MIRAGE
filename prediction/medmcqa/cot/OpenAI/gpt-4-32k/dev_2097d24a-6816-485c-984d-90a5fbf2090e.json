    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At 3 months of age, a baby's digestive system is still developing and may not be ready to handle certain foods. Introducing cereals at this age can lead to several problems. Allergy due to the food content is a possibility as the child's immune system may react to new substances. There is also a risk of gastrointestinal infection if the food is not prepared or stored properly. Retarded oro-motor development is another concern as early introduction of solid foods can interfere with the development of oral motor control. Lastly, contaminated food can lead to reflux, but this is more related to the quality of the food rather than the introduction of cereals per se.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Allergy due to the food content, B. Risk of gastrointestinal infection, C. Retarded oro-motor development\"}"
