    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a situation where a patient is given all necessary information about their diagnosis, treatment options, risks, success rates, and alternatives. This is done so that the patient can make an informed decision about their healthcare. This is not implied consent, as that would involve assumptions rather than explicit agreement. It's not express consent, which is a clear and direct indication of agreement, but doesn't necessarily involve full understanding of the situation. It's also not substitute consent, which is given by someone else on behalf of the patient. Therefore, the answer must be informed consent, which involves understanding all aspects of the treatment before agreeing to it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Informed consent\"}"
