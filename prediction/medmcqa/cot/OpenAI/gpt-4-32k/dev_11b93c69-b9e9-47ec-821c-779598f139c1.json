    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A paravertebral block is a type of regional anesthesia where an anesthetic drug is injected near the spinal nerves as they exit the vertebral column. The drug can easily diffuse to the nearby spaces. The epidural space is adjacent to the paravertebral space, so the drug can easily diffuse there. The intercostal space is also nearby, and the superior and inferior paravertebral spaces are essentially continuous with the injection site. The subarachnoid space, however, is separated from the paravertebral space by several layers of tissue and the cerebrospinal fluid, making it the least likely place for the drug to diffuse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Subarachnoid space\"}"
