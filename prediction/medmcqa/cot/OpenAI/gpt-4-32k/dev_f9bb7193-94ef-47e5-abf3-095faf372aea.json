Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is a reactive proliferation of the squamous epithelium that can mimic squamous cell carcinoma. This is a characteristic feature of granular cell tumors, which are benign neoplasms that often present as a submucosal lump. Fibroma, Rhabdomyoma, and Papilloma do not typically present with these features.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Granular cell tumour\"}"
