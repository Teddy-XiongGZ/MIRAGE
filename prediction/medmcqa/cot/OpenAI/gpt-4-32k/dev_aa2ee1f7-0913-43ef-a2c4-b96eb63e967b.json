    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand that a cyst associated with a vital tooth means that the tooth is still alive and not necrotic. Dentigerous cysts are associated with impacted or unerupted teeth, so they can be associated with vital teeth. Globulomaxillary cysts are not associated with vital teeth, they are found between the roots of the maxillary lateral incisor and canine. Radicular cysts are associated with necrotic teeth, not vital ones. OKC, or Odontogenic Keratocyst, can be associated with vital teeth as they can occur in any part of the jaws. Therefore, the correct answer should include Dentigerous cyst and OKC, but not Globulomaxillary cyst or radicular cyst.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Dentigerous cyst, OKC, radicular cyst\"}"
