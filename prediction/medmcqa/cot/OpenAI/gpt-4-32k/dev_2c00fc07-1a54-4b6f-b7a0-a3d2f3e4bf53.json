    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A pleural tap is a procedure to remove fluid from the space between the lungs and the chest wall. This is done for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. In a patient with suspected TB, the fluid would be sent for various tests to confirm the diagnosis. Gene Xpert is a molecular test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB, and it also detects resistance to rifampicin. ADA (Adenosine deaminase) is an enzyme that is present in high levels in TB and can be used as a diagnostic marker. LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) is an enzyme that is often elevated in conditions where there is tissue damage or disease, including TB. Albumin, however, is a protein that is not typically evaluated in the context of a pleural tap for suspected TB. It is more commonly measured in blood tests to assess nutritional status, liver function, and kidney disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
