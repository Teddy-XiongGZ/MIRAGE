    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a significant amount of blood drainage from the chest tube, which indicates a hemothorax. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Oxygen saturation is also slightly low, which could be due to the hemothorax. Auscultating for breath sounds and waiting for saturation to rise (option C) is not an immediate enough intervention. Clamping the chest tube (option D) could lead to tension pneumothorax. Transferring to a trauma center (option A) might take too much time. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate next step would be to prepare for an immediate open thoracotomy (option B) to control the bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
