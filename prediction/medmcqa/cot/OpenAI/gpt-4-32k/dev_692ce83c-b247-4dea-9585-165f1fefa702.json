    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retentive pin holes are used in dental restorations to provide additional retention for the restoration material. The direction of placement of these pin holes is crucial for the success of the restoration. They should not be placed perpendicular to the external tooth surface as this would not provide adequate retention. They should also not be placed parallel to the external tooth surface as this would not provide the necessary depth for the pin. Placing them parallel to other pins would not necessarily provide the best retention either. The most important factor to consider is that they should never be placed beneath the cusps to be restored, as this could compromise the integrity of the restoration and the tooth structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
