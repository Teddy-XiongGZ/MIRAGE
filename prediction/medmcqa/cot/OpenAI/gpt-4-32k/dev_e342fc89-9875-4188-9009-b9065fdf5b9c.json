    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ti6Al4V is an alpha-beta titanium alloy. The alpha phase is a hexagonal close-packed structure and is stable at room temperature. The alpha stabilizers are aluminum (Al) and oxygen, which increase the transition temperature between the alpha and beta phases. Therefore, in the alpha phase, the stable element is aluminum (Al).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
