    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner layer of the heart, the endocardium. It typically occurs when bacteria or other germs from another part of your body, such as your mouth, spread through your bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in your heart. It is more common in people with certain heart conditions. Mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis are conditions where the heart valves are narrowed, which can lead to turbulent blood flow and increase the risk of infective endocarditis. VSD, or ventricular septal defect, is a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart, which also leads to turbulent blood flow and increases the risk of infective endocarditis. ASD, or atrial septal defect, is a hole in the wall that separates the top two chambers of the heart. This condition does not cause as much turbulent blood flow as the other conditions, making it less likely to lead to infective endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. ASD.\"}"
