    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a protein that actively transports iodide ions across the cell membrane. It is primarily found in the thyroid gland, where it plays a crucial role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. It is also present in other tissues such as the salivary glands (parotid), stomach, and lactating mammary glands. The pituitary gland does not have NIS because it does not produce thyroid hormones. The placenta also has NIS because it needs to transport iodide to the fetus for its thyroid hormone production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Pituitary gland\"}"
