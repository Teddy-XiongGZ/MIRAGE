    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Nernst equation is used to calculate the equilibrium potential for an ion based on the concentrations of that ion inside and outside the cell. The Nernst equation is: E = RT/zF * ln([ion]out/[ion]in). In this case, the ion is negatively charged, so the sign of the potential will be negative. The concentration of the ion outside the cell is 100 mM, and inside the cell is 10 mM. Therefore, the Nernst potential will be negative and the magnitude will be proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of the concentrations (100/10 = 10). The Nernst equation at body temperature (approximately 37 degrees Celsius) simplifies to E = -61/z * log([ion]in/[ion]out) for negative ions. Since z=1 for monovalent ions, the potential is -61 mV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. --61 mV\"}"
