    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the only anterior tooth that has a mesiodistal size larger than its cervicoincisal dimension. The mesiodistal size refers to the width of the tooth from the mesial (front) to the distal (back) side. The cervicoincisal dimension refers to the length of the tooth from the cervical line (where the tooth and gum meet) to the incisal edge (the biting edge of the tooth). The only anterior tooth that has a mesiodistal size larger than its cervicoincisal dimension is the deciduous lower central incisor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Deciduous lower central incisor\"}"
