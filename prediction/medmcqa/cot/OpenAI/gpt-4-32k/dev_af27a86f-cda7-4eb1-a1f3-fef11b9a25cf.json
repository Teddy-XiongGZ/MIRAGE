    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the variation in red blood cell size. This variation in size is known as anisocytosis. Poikilocytosis refers to the variation in the shape of red blood cells, not their size. Hypochromia refers to red blood cells that have less color than normal, which is not what RDW measures. Anisochromia refers to a condition in which the red blood cells are of unequal color, which is also not what RDW measures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
