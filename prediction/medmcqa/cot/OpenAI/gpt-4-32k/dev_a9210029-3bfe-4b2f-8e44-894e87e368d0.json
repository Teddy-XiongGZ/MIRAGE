    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hormones can be classified into two main types based on their solubility: lipid-soluble and water-soluble. Lipid-soluble hormones can pass through the cell membrane and bind to receptors inside the cell, often in the nucleus. Water-soluble hormones, on the other hand, cannot pass through the cell membrane and bind to receptors on the cell surface. Adrenaline and insulin are water-soluble hormones, so they bind to cell surface receptors. FSH is a glycoprotein hormone, which also binds to cell surface receptors. Thyroxine, however, is a lipid-soluble hormone, so it can pass through the cell membrane and bind to receptors in the nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Thyroxine\"}"
