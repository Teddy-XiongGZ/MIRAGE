It is not an extra synol structure, but rather an intra-articular structure (A is incorrect). The PCL is indeed the primary restraint for posterior dislocation of the knee joint (B is correct).

Therefore, the statement that is not true about the PCL is that it's an extra synol structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }"
