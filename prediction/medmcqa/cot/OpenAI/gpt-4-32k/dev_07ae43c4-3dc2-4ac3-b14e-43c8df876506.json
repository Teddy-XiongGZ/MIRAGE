Heparin is used as an anticoagulant in many settings, but not typically for glucose testing. Potassium oxalate is an anticoagulant, but it's not typically used for glucose testing. Potassium oxalate + sodium fluoride is the correct choice because sodium fluoride prevents glycolysis, which can falsely lower glucose levels in the sample.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
