    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The difficulty of a 3rd molar extraction depends on the position of the tooth. A mesioangular impaction is when the tooth is angled towards the front of the mouth, which can be difficult to extract due to its proximity to other teeth. A horizontal impaction is when the tooth is lying on its side, which can also be difficult to extract due to the tooth's position against the second molar. A distoangular impaction is when the tooth is angled towards the back of the mouth, which can be difficult to extract due to its proximity to the jawbone and nerves. A vertical impaction is when the tooth is almost in its normal position, which makes it the easiest to extract.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Vertical\"}"
