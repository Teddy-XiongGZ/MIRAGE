    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Paul-Bunnell test is a diagnostic test for infectious mononucleosis, also known as 'mono' or the 'kissing disease'. This test is based on the detection of heterophile antibodies, which are antibodies that react with antigens from a species different from the one that induced their production. In the case of mono, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces the production of these heterophile antibodies in the human body. Therefore, the immunological basis behind the use of the Paul-Bunnell test is the detection of these heterophile antibodies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Heterophile antibody test\"}"
