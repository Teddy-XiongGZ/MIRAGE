    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a substance that would not cause an increase in bleeding time (BT). NSAIDs can increase BT by inhibiting platelet aggregation. Theophylline, a bronchodilator, does not have any known effects on BT. Cephalosporins, a type of antibiotic, can increase BT by interfering with vitamin K metabolism and thus clotting factors. Anti-depressants, specifically SSRIs, can increase BT by inhibiting platelet aggregation. Multivitamins containing Vitamin K would actually decrease BT because Vitamin K is necessary for the synthesis of clotting factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Theophylline\"}"
