    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pseudotumor cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without a detectable cause. The ventricular system is typically of normal size or small, which aligns with option A. There is usually no focal neurological deficit, which is consistent with option C. Intracranial pressure is indeed raised, which is the primary characteristic of this condition, so option D is also true. However, CT scans in pseudotumor cerebri typically do not show punctate hypodense areas. These are more commonly associated with conditions such as ischemic stroke or multiple sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
