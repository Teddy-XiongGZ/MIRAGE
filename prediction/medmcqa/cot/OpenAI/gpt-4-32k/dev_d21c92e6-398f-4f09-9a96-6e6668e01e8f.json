    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A partograph is a graphical record of the progress of labor and relevant details of the mother and fetus. It is used to detect any deviation from normal so that timely action can be taken. Each small square on the partograph represents one hour, so option A is correct. The alert line and action line are separated by a difference of 4 hours, so option B is also correct. The partograph recording should be started at a cervical dilation of 4 cm, so option C is correct. However, the patient should be referred to a higher level of care if the labor progression line crosses the alert line, not the action line. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
