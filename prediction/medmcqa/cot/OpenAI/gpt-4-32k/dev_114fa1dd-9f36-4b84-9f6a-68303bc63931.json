This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining. USG for fetal cardiac activity, fetal cardiac Doppler study, and MRI pelvis are all methods that can be used to confirm a pregnancy, but they are not the earliest methods. These methods are typically used later in pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
