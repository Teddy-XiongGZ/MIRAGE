    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cardiovascular system is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. The first center to receive input from the neural control of the cardiovascular system (CVS) is the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (NTS). The NTS receives afferent input from baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, which monitor blood pressure and blood chemistry, respectively. The NTS then sends signals to other centers such as the RVLM, Nucleus ambiguous, and Raphe Nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
