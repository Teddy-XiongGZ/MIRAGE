    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Without the actual spirometry curve, it's impossible to calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio. This ratio is calculated by dividing the Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) by the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Both of these values are obtained from the spirometry test, which is not provided here.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Unable to answer without the spirometry curve\"}"
