    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bite cells are a type of red blood cell that has had a 'bite' taken out of it. They are typically seen in conditions where there is an increased amount of oxidative stress on the red blood cells. G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder that causes red blood cells to become more susceptible to oxidative stress, leading to hemolytic anemia. SCA, or sickle cell anemia, is characterized by sickle-shaped cells, not bite cells. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, or round red blood cells, not bite cells. Trauma would not specifically cause bite cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. G6PD deficiency\"}"
