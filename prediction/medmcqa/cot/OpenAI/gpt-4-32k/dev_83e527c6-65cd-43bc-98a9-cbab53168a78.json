    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noncompetitive antagonism is a type of enzyme inhibition where the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site, not the active site. This changes the shape of the enzyme and prevents the substrate from binding effectively. This type of inhibition does not change the Km value, which is the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half of its maximum. However, it does decrease the Vmax, which is the maximum rate of the reaction. This is because even with high substrate concentrations, the inhibitor prevents the enzyme from reaching its maximum activity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. V max decreased; Km value normal\"}"
