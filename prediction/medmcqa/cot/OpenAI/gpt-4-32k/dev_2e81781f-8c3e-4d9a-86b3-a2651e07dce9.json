    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The blood-brain barrier is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that prevents solutes in the circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system. However, there are certain areas in the brain where this barrier is absent to allow certain substances to pass through. These areas include the subfornical organ, area postrema, and neurohypophysis. The habenular trigone, on the other hand, is not one of these areas and does have a blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Habenuclear trigone\"}"
