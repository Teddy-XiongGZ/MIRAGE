    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelinated nerve fibers are covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of nerve impulse conduction. This is due to the fact that the nerve impulse 'jumps' from one node of Ranvier to the next, a process known as saltatory conduction. Therefore, the statement that impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers is incorrect. Membrane currents are indeed generated at nodes of Ranvier, and saltatory conduction is a characteristic of myelinated fibers. Local anesthesia can be effective regardless of whether the nerve is myelinated or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
