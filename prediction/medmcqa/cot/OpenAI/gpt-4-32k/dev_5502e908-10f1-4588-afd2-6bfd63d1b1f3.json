    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Continuous hypersensitivity in a recently restored tooth indicates that the pulp of the tooth may be inflamed or infected. This could be due to the restoration being too close to the pulp, or due to bacteria reaching the pulp. No treatment is not an option as it could lead to further complications. Zinc Oxide Eugenol (ZOE) is used as a temporary filling material and won't solve the problem if the pulp is infected. Direct pulp capping is used when the pulp is exposed but not infected. Therefore, the best option is to perform a pulpectomy, which involves removing the entire pulp from the crown and root of the tooth to alleviate the hypersensitivity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Perform pulpectomy\"}"
