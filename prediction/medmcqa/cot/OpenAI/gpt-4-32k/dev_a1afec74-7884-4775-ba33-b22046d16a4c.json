    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Type I diabetes mellitus is characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin, which is necessary for the uptake of glucose into cells. This leads to high blood sugar levels. Polyuria, or excessive urination, is a common symptom of high blood sugar levels. The body tries to get rid of the excess glucose through urine. Now, let's analyze the options. A. Glycogenesis in muscle - This is the process of converting glucose into glycogen for storage. This would require insulin, which is lacking in Type I diabetes. B. Increased protein synthesis - This is not directly related to diabetes. C. Increased conversion of fatty acid to acetyl CoA - In the absence of glucose, the body will start breaking down fats for energy. This process involves the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA. D. Decreased cholesterol synthesis - This is not directly related to diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
