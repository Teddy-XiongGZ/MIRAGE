    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Without an actual x-ray image, it's impossible to make a definitive diagnosis. However, I can provide some general information about these fractures. A Galeazzi fracture involves a fracture of the radius with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. A Monteggia fracture involves a fracture of the ulna with dislocation of the proximal radioulnar joint. A Colles' fracture is a distal radius fracture with dorsal (posterior) displacement of the wrist and hand. A Smith's fracture is also a fracture of the distal radius, but with volar (anterior) displacement. The most common fracture from a fall on an outstretched hand is a Colles' fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Colles fracture\"}"
