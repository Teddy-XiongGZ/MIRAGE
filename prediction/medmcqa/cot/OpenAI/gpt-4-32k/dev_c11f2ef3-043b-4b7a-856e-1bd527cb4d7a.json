    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The preauricular region is the area in front of the ear, which is where the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is located. A fall could potentially cause a fracture or dislocation in this area. The mandible deviating to the right side on mouth opening suggests that the left side is not moving properly, which could be due to a fracture or dislocation of the left condyle. However, the patient has pain in both preauricular regions, which suggests that both condyles might be affected. If both condyles were dislocated, the mandible would likely deviate to the side of the less severe dislocation, which is not specified in the question. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis would be a fracture of the left condyle, causing the mandible to deviate to the right when the mouth is opened.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Fracture of left condyle\"}"
