    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the risk in each group. The risk is calculated as the number of people who developed complications divided by the total number of people in the group. For the control group, the risk is 1800/15225 = 0.118. For the intervention group, the risk is 1620/15225 = 0.106. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference in risks between the two groups, which is 0.118 - 0.106 = 0.012 or 1.2%. The relative risk (RR) is the risk in the intervention group divided by the risk in the control group, which is 0.106/0.118 = 0.9. Therefore, the correct answer is ARR = 1.2% and RR = 0.9.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
