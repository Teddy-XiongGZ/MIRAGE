    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To diagnose a root fracture, it is important to take X-rays at different angles. This is because a fracture may not be visible from a single angle. The standard angles for dental X-rays are 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0. The 90\u00b0 angle is used for periapical and bitewing X-rays, which show the entire tooth from the crown to the root. The 45\u00b0 angle is used for occlusal X-rays, which show the roof or floor of the mouth. The 110\u00b0 angle is not typically used in dental radiography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0\"}"
