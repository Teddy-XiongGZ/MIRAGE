    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Interdental papilla protruding from the rubber dam can be caused by several factors. Inflammation of interdental papillae (option A) could cause swelling and protrusion, but it's not directly related to the rubber dam application. The weight of the rubber dam (option B) doesn't affect the position of the interdental papilla. The placement of the punch holes in the rubber dam is what determines how well it fits around the teeth and gums. If the punches are placed too far apart (option C), the dam may not fit snugly and could allow the papilla to protrude. However, if the punches are placed too close together (option D), the dam may stretch too tightly and push the papilla out, which is the most common cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
