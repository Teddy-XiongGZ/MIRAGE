    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alcoholic hepatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption. The diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is usually made based on clinical symptoms, history of alcohol use, and laboratory tests. Among the options given, ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) is a liver enzyme that can be elevated in various liver diseases, but it is not specific for alcoholic hepatitis. LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) is a marker of tissue damage and is not specific for liver disease. AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase) are both liver enzymes that can be elevated in alcoholic hepatitis. However, GGT is more specific for alcohol-induced liver disease as its levels increase even with moderate alcohol consumption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. GGT\"}"
