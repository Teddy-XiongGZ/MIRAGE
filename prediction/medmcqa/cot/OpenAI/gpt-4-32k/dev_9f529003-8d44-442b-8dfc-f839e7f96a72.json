    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemoptysis is the coughing up of blood or blood-stained mucus from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs. In this context, the patient's hemoptysis is massive, but routine investigations and chest X-ray are normal. This means we need to consider interventions that can help control the bleeding. Bronchial artery embolization is a procedure that is often used to control hemoptysis. It involves blocking the bronchial arteries to prevent further bleeding. Bronchoscopic laser cauterization is another procedure that can be used to control bleeding in the bronchi. It involves using a laser to seal off the bleeding vessels. Lobectomy of the affected segment is a surgical procedure that involves removing the lobe of the lung where the bleeding is occurring. However, pulmonary artery embolization is not typically done to prevent hemoptysis. This procedure involves blocking the pulmonary arteries, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary infarction and is not a common treatment for hemoptysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pulmonary aery embolization\"}"
