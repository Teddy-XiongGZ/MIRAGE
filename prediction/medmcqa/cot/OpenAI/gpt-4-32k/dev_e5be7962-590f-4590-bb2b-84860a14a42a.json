    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Massive blood transfusion can lead to several complications. One of the most common complications is a metabolic disturbance. This is because the blood used in transfusions is often stored in a citrate solution, which can bind to calcium in the recipient's blood and lead to hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can then lead to a condition called citrate toxicity, which can cause a metabolic acidosis. Therefore, metabolic acidosis is the most likely complication of massive blood transfusion among the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
