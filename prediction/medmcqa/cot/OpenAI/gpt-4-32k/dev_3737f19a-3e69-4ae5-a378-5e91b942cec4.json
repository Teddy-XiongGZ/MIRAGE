    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms described are indicative of food poisoning. The time frame of 6-10 hours after consumption is too short for a bacterial infection like E.coli or a viral infection like Rotavirus, which usually take 1-3 days to manifest symptoms. Clostridium perfringens infection usually causes symptoms 8-12 hours after ingestion, which is a bit longer than the time frame given. Staphylococcal toxin, on the other hand, can cause symptoms as quickly as 1-6 hours after ingestion, which fits the time frame given in the question. Therefore, the most likely cause of the outbreak is Staphylococcal toxin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Staphylococcal toxin\"}"
