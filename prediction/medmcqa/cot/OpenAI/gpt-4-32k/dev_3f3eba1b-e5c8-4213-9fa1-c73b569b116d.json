    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The arch perimeter refers to the measurement around the dental arch. A cephalogram is a type of x-ray used to view the side of the head, so it wouldn't be used to measure the arch perimeter. An occlusal radiograph is a type of x-ray that captures the roof or floor of the mouth, and it also wouldn't be used to measure the arch perimeter. Vernier calipers are a measuring tool used to take precise measurements, but they are not typically used in dentistry to measure the arch perimeter. Brass wire, however, is commonly used in orthodontics to measure the arch perimeter by bending it to fit the shape of the arch and then measuring the length of the wire.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Brass wire\"}"
