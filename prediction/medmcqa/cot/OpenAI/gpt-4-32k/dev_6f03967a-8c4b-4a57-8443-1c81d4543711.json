    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the kidneys. Grade V is the most severe form of VUR. The treatment of choice for primary grade V VUR is usually surgical, especially when it involves both kidneys. Antibiotic prophylaxis is usually used for lower grades of VUR or as a preventive measure against urinary tract infections. Cystoscopy followed by subureteric injection of teflon is a less invasive procedure but it's not as effective as surgery for severe VUR. Bilateral ureterostomies is a more drastic surgical procedure that is usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed. Ureteric reimplantation is a surgical procedure that corrects the position of the ureters where they enter the bladder, which can prevent urine from flowing backward into the kidneys. This is the most common surgical treatment for severe VUR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ureteric reimplantation\"}"
