    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle spindles are sensory receptors within the belly of a muscle, which primarily detect changes in the length of this muscle. They convey length information to the central nervous system via sensory neurons. This information can be processed by the brain to determine the position of body parts. The muscle spindle has both sensory and motor components. It is not only located in antigravity extensor muscles, but in most skeletal muscles. It is excited by stretch, not contraction. Therefore, it is a receptor for stretch reflex, not multisynaptic reflexes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
