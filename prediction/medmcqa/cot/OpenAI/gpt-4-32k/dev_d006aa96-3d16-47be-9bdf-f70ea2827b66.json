    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-working side interference refers to the unwanted contact of teeth on the side of the mouth that is not engaged in chewing or biting. This can cause discomfort and damage to the teeth over time. The interference is usually caused by the supporting cusps of the teeth. The supporting cusps are the parts of the teeth that make contact with the opposing teeth during biting and chewing. To remove non-working side interference, it would be necessary to reduce the height of the supporting cusps. However, it's not necessary to reduce the cusps of both arches. The interference could be caused by either the maxillary (upper) or mandibular (lower) supporting cusps. Therefore, the appropriate action would be to reduce the supporting cusps of the arch that is causing the interference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Either of the arch's supporting cusps should be reduced.\"}"
