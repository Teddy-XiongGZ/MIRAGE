    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The girdle-like elevation on the lingual surface of anterior teeth is a specific anatomical feature. Mamelons are found on the incisal edge of newly erupted teeth, not on the lingual surface. The incisal edge and incisal ridge are the biting surfaces of the teeth, not a girdle-like elevation on the lingual surface. The cingulum, however, is a convex, rounded eminence on the lingual surface of the anterior teeth, which matches the description.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cingulam\"}"
