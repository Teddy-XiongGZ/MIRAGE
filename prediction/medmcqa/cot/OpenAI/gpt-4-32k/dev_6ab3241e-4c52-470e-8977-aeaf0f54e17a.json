    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Obstructive jaundice is a condition where there is a blockage in the flow of bile from the liver to the intestines, leading to a buildup of bilirubin in the body. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including gallstones, tumors, or inflammation. A bilirubin level of 40 mg/dL is extremely high, as normal levels are usually less than 1 mg/dL. This could be due to a complete obstruction of the common bile duct, which would prevent any bile (and therefore bilirubin) from being excreted from the body. While malignant obstruction, renal failure, and liver failure can all cause increased bilirubin levels, they would not likely cause levels to be this high.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Complete obstruction of common bile duct\"}"
