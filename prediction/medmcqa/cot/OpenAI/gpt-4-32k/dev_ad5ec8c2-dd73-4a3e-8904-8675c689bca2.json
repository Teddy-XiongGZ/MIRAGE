    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"HbA1c, or glycated hemoglobin, is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the three-month average plasma glucose concentration. The test is limited to a three-month average because the lifespan of a red blood cell is four months (120 days). There are several methods to measure HbA1c, but the most common and reliable method is High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Among the given options, affinity chromatography is a type of HPLC. It works by passing a solution containing the protein mixture through a column filled with a material that binds to the protein of interest. The other proteins are then washed away.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Affinity chromatography\"}"
