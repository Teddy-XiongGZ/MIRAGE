    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen phosphorylase is an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, which is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. This enzyme is regulated by several cofactors. Calmodulin is a calcium-binding messenger protein involved in many cellular processes, but it is not a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase. c-AMP and Protein Kinase A are both involved in the regulation of glycogen phosphorylase. Glycogenin is actually an enzyme involved in the synthesis of glycogen, not its breakdown.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Calmodulin\"}"
