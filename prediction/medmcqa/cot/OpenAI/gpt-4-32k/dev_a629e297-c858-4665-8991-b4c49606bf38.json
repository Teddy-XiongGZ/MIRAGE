    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular angle is a common site for fractures and infection can complicate the healing process. The treatment of infected mandibular angle fractures involves both surgical and medical management. The surgical management includes debridement of the infected area and stabilization of the fracture. The stabilization can be achieved by using different types of plates. However, in the case of infection, the use of plates might not be the best option as they can act as a foreign body and can further propagate the infection. Intermaxillary fixation (IMF) along with incision and drainage (ID) is a more suitable option as it allows for the drainage of the infection and immobilization of the fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. IMF + ID\"}"
