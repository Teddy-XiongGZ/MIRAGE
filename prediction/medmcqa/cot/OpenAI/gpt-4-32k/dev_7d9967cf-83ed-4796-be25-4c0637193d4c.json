    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The absolute refractory period is the time during which another stimulus given to the neuron (no matter how strong) will not lead to a second action potential. This occurs due to the inactivation of the Na+ channels, which means that they are temporarily not responsive to a new stimulus. This is not related to the closure of activated Na+ channels, hyperpolarization of Cl- channels, or the opening of rectifier K+ channels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Closure of inactivated Na channels\"}"
