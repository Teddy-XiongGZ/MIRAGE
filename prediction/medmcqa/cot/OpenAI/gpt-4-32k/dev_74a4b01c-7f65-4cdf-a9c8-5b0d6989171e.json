    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiotherapy is a treatment that involves the use of high-energy radiation, which can cause damage to the skin cells. This damage can lead to various skin reactions. Erythema, or redness of the skin, is a common early reaction to radiotherapy, typically occurring within a few days to weeks after treatment begins. Depigmentation and radiation induced carcinomas are late effects of radiation therapy, which usually occur months to years after treatment. Therefore, it is unlikely that these would be seen after just 2 weeks. Lastly, it is also unlikely that there would be no change to the skin after radiotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
