    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KOT) is a benign but aggressive odontogenic tumor. The treatment of KOT is controversial due to its high recurrence rate. However, the most common treatment is enucleation and peripheral osteotomy, sometimes combined with chemical cauterization to reduce the risk of recurrence. Mandible resection, with or without continuity defect, and immediate reconstruction is usually reserved for more aggressive or recurrent cases. Cauterization and delayed reconstruction is not a typical treatment for KOT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
