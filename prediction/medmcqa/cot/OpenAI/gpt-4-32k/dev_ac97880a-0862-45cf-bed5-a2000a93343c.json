    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stage I cancer is an early stage cancer. In the case of laryngeal cancer, the tumor is small and has not spread to nearby tissues, lymph nodes or other parts of the body. The treatment of choice for early stage laryngeal cancer is usually radiotherapy. This is because radiotherapy can often cure the cancer and preserve the function of the larynx, allowing the patient to maintain their ability to speak. Radical surgery and surgery followed by radiotherapy are usually reserved for more advanced stages of the disease. Chemotherapy is typically used in combination with radiotherapy for advanced stages or when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
