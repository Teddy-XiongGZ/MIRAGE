    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the characteristics of secondary targets in relation to primary targets when it comes to adverse events. The secondary target does not necessarily need to be present in the same tissue as the primary target (A), as adverse events can occur in different tissues. The secondary target does not need to have an absolutely identical secondary structure (C) or similar primary structure (D) to the primary target. However, for a drug to bind to a secondary target, it would need to have similar binding sites (B) to the primary target, as the drug is designed to bind to specific sites.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
