    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum receive two types of excitatory inputs: climbing fibers and mossy fibers. Climbing fibers originate from the inferior olivary nucleus, while mossy fibers come from a variety of sources, including the vestibular nuclei, the spinal cord, and the pontine nuclei. However, the question specifically asks for fibers reaching directly to the Purkinje cells, which would be the climbing fibers from the inferior olivary nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Inferior olivary nucleus\"}"
