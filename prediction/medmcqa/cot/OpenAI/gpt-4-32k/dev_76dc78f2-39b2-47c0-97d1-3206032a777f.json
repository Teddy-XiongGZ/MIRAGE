    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a complication of blood transfusion where the body's immune system destroys the transfused red blood cells. This usually occurs within 3-10 days after the transfusion. The symptoms include fever, chills, and jaundice. The Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) is usually positive in DHTR, indicating that antibodies have attached to the red blood cells. Spherocytes are not typically seen in DHTR, they are more associated with conditions like hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Haemoglobinuria (presence of hemoglobin in the urine) and reduced hemoglobin levels are also seen in DHTR as the red blood cells are destroyed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Spherocytes positive\"}"
