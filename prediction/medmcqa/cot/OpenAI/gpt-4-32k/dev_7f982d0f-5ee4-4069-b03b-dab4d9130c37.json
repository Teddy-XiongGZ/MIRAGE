    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that is typically associated with an extra copy of chromosome 21, which is referred to as Trisomy 21, so option A is incorrect. Mosaicism is a condition in which an individual has two or more genetically different sets of cells in his or her body, so if one of these sets has an extra chromosome 21, it could also cause Down syndrome, so option B is incorrect. Robertsonian translocation is a specific type of chromosomal rearrangement that can result in an extra copy of chromosome 21, so option C is incorrect. Deletion of chromosome 21 would not result in Down syndrome, as the disorder is caused by an extra copy of the chromosome, not a missing one.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
