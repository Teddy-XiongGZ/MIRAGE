    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. Defective apoptosis can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival, which is a hallmark of cancer. However, none of the options provided are directly related to cancer. Neurodegenerative diseases are typically associated with excessive cell death, not increased cell survival. Myocardial infarction and stroke are conditions caused by the blockage of blood supply, leading to cell death due to lack of oxygen and nutrients. Autoimmune disorders, on the other hand, are characterized by an overactive immune response against substances and tissues normally present in the body. In some cases, defective apoptosis can lead to the survival of self-reactive immune cells, contributing to the development of autoimmune disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Auto immune disorders\"}"
