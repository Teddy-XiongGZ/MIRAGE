    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar levels. It's often used to treat hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. A large for date baby, an infant of a diabetic mother, and a baby with galactosemia can all potentially benefit from glucagon injections because these conditions can lead to hypoglycemia. However, nesidioblastosis is a condition where the pancreas produces too much insulin, leading to persistent hypoglycemia. In this case, glucagon would not be effective because the problem is not a lack of glucose, but an overproduction of insulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Nesidioblastosis\" }"
