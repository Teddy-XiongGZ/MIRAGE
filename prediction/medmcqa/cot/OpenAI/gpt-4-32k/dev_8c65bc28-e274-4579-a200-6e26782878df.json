    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An open bite is a type of malocclusion where the upper and lower teeth do not touch when the mouth is closed. It is not typically caused by fractures. A horizontal fracture of the maxilla (A) or a fracture of the mandibular symphysis (D) could potentially cause an open bite, but these are not the typical causes. A unilateral fracture of the mandibular angle (B) or a fracture of the coronoid process of the left side of the mandible (C) would not typically cause an open bite, as these fractures would more likely affect the alignment of the jaw rather than the occlusion of the teeth. Therefore, none of the options provided are the typical causes of a true open bite, which is usually caused by habits such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, or prolonged use of a pacifier or bottle, or by skeletal problems.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
