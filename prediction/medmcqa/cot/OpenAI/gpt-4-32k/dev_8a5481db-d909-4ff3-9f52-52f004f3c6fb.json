    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Babies born to diabetic mothers are at risk for several complications. Hyperbilirubinemia, or high levels of bilirubin in the blood, can occur due to increased red blood cell turnover. Hypocalcemia, or low calcium levels, and hypomagnesemia, or low magnesium levels, can occur due to changes in the mother's metabolism. However, hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, is not typically a complication in newborns of diabetic mothers. Instead, these babies are at risk for hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, because their bodies produce extra insulin in response to the mother's high blood sugar levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
