    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The researcher is concerned about the potential influence of factors other than smoking on the blood lipid levels. These factors, such as diet and exercise, are known as confounding variables because they could potentially confuse the results and make it unclear whether the differences in lipid levels are due to smoking or these other factors. This concern is not about recall bias, which is when participants do not remember past events accurately. It's also not about information bias, which is a systematic error in the collection of data. It's not about interviewer bias either, which is when the interviewer influences the responses of the participant. The concern is about selection bias, which is a distortion of a statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting samples. In this case, the researcher is worried that the smokers and non-smokers might be inherently different (in terms of diet, exercise, etc.), which could lead to a biased result.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Selection bias\"}"
