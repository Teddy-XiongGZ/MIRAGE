    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The palate is innervated by several nerves. The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve provides sensory innervation to the hard palate. The facial nerve provides taste sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but it does not innervate the palate. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the soft palate. The hypoglossal nerve, however, is a motor nerve that controls the muscles of the tongue and does not provide any sensory innervation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hypoglossal nerve\"}"
