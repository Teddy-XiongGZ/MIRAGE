    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The transport of carbon monoxide (CO) in the body is primarily through its binding with hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood, forming carboxyhemoglobin. This process is not diffusion limited. The diffusion limitation refers to the rate at which a gas moves from the alveoli in the lungs into the blood. This is not primarily affected by the binding of CO to Hb, the partial pressure of CO, or the solubility of CO in water. However, the permeability of the alveolar membrane can affect the rate of diffusion of gases, including CO. If the alveolar membrane is less permeable, it can limit the diffusion of CO.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
