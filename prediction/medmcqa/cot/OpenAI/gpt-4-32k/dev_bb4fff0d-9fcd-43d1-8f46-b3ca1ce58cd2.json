    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epithelial lining is a layer of cells that covers the body's surface and lines the internal organs and structures. Sinuses are lined with epithelial cells, so option A is incorrect. Fistulae, abnormal connections between two body parts, are also lined with epithelial cells, so option B is incorrect. Keratocytes are a type of cell found in the cornea, not a location where epithelial lining would be found, so option D could be a potential answer. An aneurismal bone cyst is a type of benign bone tumor that does not typically have an epithelial lining, so option C could also be a potential answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Aneurismal bone cysts\"}"
