    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pituitary gland produces several hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The pituitary gland also produces follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which stimulate the ovaries to produce estradiol. If the pituitary gland is removed, replacement of these hormones would be necessary. However, mineralocorticoids are primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, not by the pituitary gland. Therefore, replacement of mineralocorticoids would not be necessary after removal of the pituitary gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Mineralocoicoids\"}"
