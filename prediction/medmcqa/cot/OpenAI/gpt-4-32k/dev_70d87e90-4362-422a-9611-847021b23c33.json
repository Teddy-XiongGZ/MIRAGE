    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, is a medical emergency where the blood supply to the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. This can cause damage to the heart muscle and lead to a variety of complications. When the heart muscle is damaged, it releases certain enzymes into the blood. The first enzyme to rise in the blood after a myocardial infarction is typically Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), which is also known as Creatine kinase (CK). This enzyme is found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. When these tissues are damaged, CPK is released into the blood. Therefore, high levels of CPK in the blood can indicate that there has been damage to these tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
