    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has lower natural teeth and 7 maxillary implants placed with a space of 15 mm for the restoration. This indicates that the patient has a significant amount of space for a prosthetic device. Single crowns and bridges, whether screw or cement retained, are typically used when there are only one or two missing teeth. An overdenture is a type of removable denture that is supported by and attached to implants, but it might not provide the stability needed for a large space.

It is designed to replace all the teeth in an arch, making it a suitable option for this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hybrid denture\"}"
