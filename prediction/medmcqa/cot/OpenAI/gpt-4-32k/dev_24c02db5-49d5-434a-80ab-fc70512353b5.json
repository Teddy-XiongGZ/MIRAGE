    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intrafusal fibers are a component of muscle spindles, which are sensory organs that detect changes in muscle length. These fibers have a unique structure where the central region is non-contractile and encapsulates sensory nerve endings, while the ends of the fibers are contractile. This allows the muscle spindle to adjust its length and sensitivity during muscle contraction and relaxation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ends\"}"
