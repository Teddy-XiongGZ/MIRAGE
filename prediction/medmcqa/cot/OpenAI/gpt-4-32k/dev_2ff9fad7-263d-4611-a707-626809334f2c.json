    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) is a common complication of blood transfusion. It is caused by the reaction of the recipient's antibodies to the donor's leukocytes. Therefore, the processing that should be done to reduce the chances of FNHTR is to remove these leukocytes. Irradiation is used to prevent graft versus host disease, not FNHTR. Washing is used to remove plasma from the blood components, not specifically leukocytes. Glycolisation is not a process used in blood transfusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Leucocyte reduction\"}"
