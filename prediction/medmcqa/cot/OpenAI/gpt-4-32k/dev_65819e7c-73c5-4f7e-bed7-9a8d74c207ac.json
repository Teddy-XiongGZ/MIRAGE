    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Foley's catheter is a type of urinary catheter that is held in place by a balloon filled with water. If it cannot be removed, it is likely that the balloon is not deflating. The first step would be to try to deflate the balloon. CT-guided rupture of the bulb of Foley's (option A) is not a common or safe procedure. Injecting ether to dissolve the balloon (option B) is also not a safe or recommended procedure. Overdistending the balloon with water (option C) could cause damage to the patient's urethra. Using ultrasound guidance to locate and prick the balloon (option D) is the safest and most common procedure in this situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
