    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Flow cytometry is a technique used to detect and measure physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells or particles. It is commonly used in the diagnosis of health disorders, especially blood cancers, but can be used in many other applications. Bruton disease, also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia, is a condition that affects the immune system and is characterized by repeated infections. It can be diagnosed by flow cytometry by looking at the absence or very low numbers of B cells. Bare lymphocyte syndrome, Hyper IgM syndrome, and Severe combined immunodeficiency disease are also immune disorders, but they are not typically diagnosed using flow cytometry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
