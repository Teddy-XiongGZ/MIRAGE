    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel, the outermost layer of teeth, is a calcified tissue. It can form a chemical bond with certain dental materials. Composites (A) and direct filling resins (B) can bond with enamel, but this is usually achieved through the use of an intermediate bonding agent, not a direct chemical bond. Polycarboxylate cements (C) can chemically bond with enamel, as they contain polyacrylic acid, which can react with the calcium in enamel. BIS-GMA resins in pit and fissure sealants (D) also form a chemical bond with enamel, as they contain bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate, which can react with the hydroxyapatite in enamel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Polycarboxylate cements\"}"
