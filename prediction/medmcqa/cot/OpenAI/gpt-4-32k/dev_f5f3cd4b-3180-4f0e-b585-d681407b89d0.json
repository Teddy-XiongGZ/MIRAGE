    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the range in which 95% of the population would lie. This is a reference to the 95% confidence interval in statistics, which is calculated using the mean and standard deviation. The 95% confidence interval is typically calculated as the mean plus or minus 1.96 times the standard deviation. In this case, the mean is 25 mm Hg and the standard deviation is 10 mm Hg. So, the calculation would be 25 \u00b1 (1.96*10), which gives a range of 5 to 45 mm Hg. However, none of the answer choices match this range. This suggests that the question may be asking for the range of the middle 95%, which would exclude the top 2.5% and bottom 2.5%. In a normal distribution, this range is typically within \u00b12 standard deviations of the mean. So, the calculation would be 25 \u00b1 (2*10), which gives a range of 5 to 45 mm Hg. Again, none of the answer choices match this range. Therefore, the question may be incorrectly worded or the answer choices may be incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\" }"
