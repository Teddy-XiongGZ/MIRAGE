    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tetanizing frequency is the frequency at which individual twitches overlap and summate, resulting in a sustained muscle contraction. This occurs when the frequency is high enough that a new twitch begins before the previous one has finished. The total time for one twitch cycle is the sum of the latent period, contraction time, and relaxation time. In this case, it's 10 ms + 40 ms + 50 ms = 100 ms. The frequency is the reciprocal of the time period, so the tetanizing frequency would be 1 / 0.1 s = 10 Hz. However, none of the options match this calculation. There might be a mistake in the question or the provided options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
