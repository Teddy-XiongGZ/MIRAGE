    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radicular access is the process of gaining access to the root canals of a tooth. This is typically done after entry into the tooth has been made. The Gates Glidden drill is used for widening the coronal part of the canal. The K-File and K-Reamer are both used for cleaning and shaping the root canal, but they are not specifically used for making radicular access. The round bur is used for initial entry into the tooth, not for radicular access. Therefore, the Gates Glidden drill is the most appropriate tool for making radicular access after entry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
