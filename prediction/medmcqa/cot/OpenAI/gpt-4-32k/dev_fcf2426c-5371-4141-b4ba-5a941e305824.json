    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Relative bradycardia is a condition where the heart rate is less than expected for a given body temperature. It is commonly seen in diseases like Brucellosis and Typhoid where the heart rate does not increase as expected with the rise in body temperature. Malaria is also known to cause relative bradycardia. However, Factitious fever, which is a fever that is faked or self-induced, typically does not have relative bradycardia because the body's physiological responses are not truly engaged as they would be in a real infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
