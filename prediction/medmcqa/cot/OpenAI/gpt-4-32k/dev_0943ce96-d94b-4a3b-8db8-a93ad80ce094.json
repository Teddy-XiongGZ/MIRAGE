    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The American Dental Association recommends that children under the age of 6 who live in areas where the fluoride concentration in the water is less than 0.3 ppm should receive a fluoride supplement. In this case, the child's drinking water contains 0.2 ppm fluoride, which is less than the recommended amount. Therefore, the child should receive a fluoride supplement. However, the form of the supplement should be appropriate for the child's age. A 1 mg tablet per day might be too much for a 4-year-old child. Rinses are generally not recommended for children under the age of 6 because they may swallow it. Topical application of fluoride is usually done in a dental office and not a daily routine. Fluoride-containing dentifrices, such as toothpaste, can be used daily and are safe for children if used in the correct amount.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Fluoride containing dentifrices\"}"
