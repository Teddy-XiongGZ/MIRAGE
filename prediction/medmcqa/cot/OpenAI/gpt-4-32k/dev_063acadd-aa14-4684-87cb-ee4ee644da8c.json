    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent loss of the testicle.

Therefore, immediate exploration and detorsion is necessary. Operating on the opposite side is not necessary unless it is also symptomatic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
