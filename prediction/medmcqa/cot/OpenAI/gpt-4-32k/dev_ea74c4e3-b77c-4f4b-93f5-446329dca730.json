    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzyme activity can be influenced by several factors. A. Increase in temperature can increase enzyme activity to a certain point, but if the temperature gets too high, it can denature the enzyme and decrease its activity. B. Decrease in activation energy can increase enzyme activity because it makes it easier for the reaction to occur. C. Extremes of pH value can denature the enzyme and decrease its activity. D. Low substrate concentration can decrease enzyme activity because there are fewer substrates for the enzyme to act on.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
