    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Left ventricular hypertrophy in a child is usually due to a condition that causes increased pressure in the left ventricle. Central cyanosis is a sign of low oxygen levels in the blood. Tricuspid atresia, Eisenmenger syndrome, and Tetrology of Fallot are all conditions that can cause cyanosis, but they are typically associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, not left. Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage is a condition where the pulmonary veins do not connect properly to the left atrium, causing blood to bypass the lungs and leading to cyanosis. This condition can also cause left ventricular hypertrophy due to the increased pressure on the left side of the heart.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage\"}"
