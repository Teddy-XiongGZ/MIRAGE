    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Grids are used in radiography to improve the quality of the images by reducing the scatter radiation, which can degrade the image quality. However, they do have some disadvantages. They do not increase skin exposure of the patient, so option A is incorrect. They do increase the exposure time because more radiation is needed to get the same image quality, so option B is correct. They do improve the image by reducing scatter radiation, so option C is incorrect. They do not increase the overall density of the radiograph, they just change the distribution of the radiation, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
