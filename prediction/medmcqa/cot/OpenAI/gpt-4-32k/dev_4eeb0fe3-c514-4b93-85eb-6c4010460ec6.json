    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In centric occlusion, the upper and lower teeth should fit together comfortably without any edge to edge contact. This is because such contact can lead to instability and discomfort. The best way to correct this is to adjust the cusps of the teeth. The incline of the upper cusp should slide buccally (towards the cheek) and the lower cusp should slide lingually (towards the tongue). This will ensure a proper fit and comfortable occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
