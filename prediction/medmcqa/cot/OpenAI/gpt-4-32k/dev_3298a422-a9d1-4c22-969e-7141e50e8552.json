    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The distolingual extension of the mandibular impression for a complete denture is limited by the muscle that is located in the area and involved in the movement of the mandible. The stylohyoid muscle is not directly involved in mandibular movements. The medial and lateral pterygoid muscles are involved in the movements of the mandible, but they are not located in the distolingual area. The superior constrictor muscle is a muscle of the pharynx and not directly involved in mandibular movements. Therefore, none of these muscles limit the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression for a complete denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
