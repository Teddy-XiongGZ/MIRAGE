    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Creep is the slow change in shape caused by compression. In dental amalgam, creep is affected by factors such as trituration and condensation pressure. Over trituration or under trituration of amalgam can lead to an increase in creep, not a decrease. Similarly, an increase in condensation pressure can lead to a decrease in creep, not an increase. Therefore, the decrease in creep occurs with an increase in condensation pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increases with condensation pressure\"}"
