    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Indirect retention is a concept in prosthodontics, specifically in the design of removable partial dentures (RPDs). It is used to counteract the dislodging forces acting on the distal extension denture bases. These forces tend to lift the denture base away from the tissues in an occlusal direction. Therefore, indirect retention is not primarily about stabilizing tooth borne RPD (option A) or engaging an undercut area of the abutment tooth (option B). It is about resisting movements of the denture base. Between options C and D, indirect retention is specifically designed to resist dislodgement in the occlusal direction, not just any tissue ward movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
