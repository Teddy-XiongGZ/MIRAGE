    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The superior orbital fissure is a gap or opening in the skull, located between the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid bone. It transmits several important structures, including the oculomotor nerve (III), the trochlear nerve (IV), the abducens nerve (VI), and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). Therefore, a metal rod inserted in the superior orbital fissure could potentially damage any of these nerves. However, the vagus nerve does not pass through the superior orbital fissure, so it would not be affected by this injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Occulomotor and ophthalmic nerve\"}"
