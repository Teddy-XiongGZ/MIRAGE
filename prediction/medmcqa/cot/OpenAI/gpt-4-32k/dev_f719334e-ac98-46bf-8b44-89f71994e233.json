    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity, also known as Young's modulus, is a measure of the stiffness of a material. It defines the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (proportional deformation) in a material. It does not refer to the ability to be stretched with permanent deformation, which is plasticity, nor does it refer to ductility or malleability, which are other properties of materials.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
