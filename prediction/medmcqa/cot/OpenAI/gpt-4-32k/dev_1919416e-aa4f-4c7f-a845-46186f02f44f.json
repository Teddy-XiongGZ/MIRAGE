    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glanzmann's disease, also known as Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. It is not related to red blood cells (RBCs) or neutrophils, but rather to platelets. Platelets are the cells that help the blood clot. In Glanzmann's disease, the platelets are present in normal numbers, but they're either missing or have a lower than normal amount of certain proteins that are needed for blood clotting. Therefore, it is a congenital defect of platelets, not a clotting factor deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
