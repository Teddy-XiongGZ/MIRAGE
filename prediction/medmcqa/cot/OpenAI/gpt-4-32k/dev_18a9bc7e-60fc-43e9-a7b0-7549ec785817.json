    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The digastric muscle is a small muscle located in the neck, under the jaw. It has two parts, or 'bellies', which are connected by a central tendon. The digastric muscle is involved in several actions related to the mouth and throat. It helps to open the mouth wide when the masseter and the temporalis are relaxed. Therefore, it depresses the mandible. It also helps in swallowing by elevating the hyoid bone and steady the lower jaw and the mouth opened. It does not contribute to the protrusion or side-to-side movement of the mandible, nor does it depress the floor of the mouth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
