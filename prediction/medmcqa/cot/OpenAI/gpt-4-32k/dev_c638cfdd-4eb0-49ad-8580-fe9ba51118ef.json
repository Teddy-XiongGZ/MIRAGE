    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Choriocarcinoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the placenta, typically during or after pregnancy. The staging of cancer generally refers to the extent of the spread of the disease. Stage 1 usually means the cancer is localized and has not spread to other parts of the body. Stage 2 and 3 indicate a larger tumor size or spread to nearby tissues. Stage 4, however, is the most advanced stage of cancer, indicating that the cancer has spread to other organs or parts of the body. Therefore, lung metastasis in choriocarcinoma would most likely occur in Stage 4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
