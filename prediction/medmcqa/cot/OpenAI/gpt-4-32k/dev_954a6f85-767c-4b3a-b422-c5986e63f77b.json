    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Excessive occlusal forces refer to the extra pressure exerted on the teeth during biting or chewing. This can lead to various dental problems, especially in cases where the periodontium (the tissues surrounding and supporting the teeth) is not healthy or the bone height is reduced. In a normal periodontium with normal height of bone, the teeth and surrounding tissues are healthy and can withstand normal occlusal forces. Therefore, excessive occlusal forces would not be superimposed in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
