    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cumulative index is a term used to describe a type of index that accumulates or adds up over time. In the context of periodontal health, this would refer to an index that measures the cumulative effect of periodontal disease over time. Russet's and Ramjford's periodontal indexes are specific types of periodontal indexes, but they are not necessarily cumulative. The PMA (Massler and Schlour) is a plaque index, which could be considered cumulative as it measures the accumulation of plaque over time. The Gingival index (Loe and Silness) is a measure of gingival inflammation, which could also be considered cumulative as it measures the progression of gingival inflammation over time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. PMA (Massler and Schlour)\"}"
