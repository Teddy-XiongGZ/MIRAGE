    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Central cyanosis in a neonate is a sign of a congenital heart defect that causes a right-to-left shunt, meaning that deoxygenated blood is being pumped into the systemic circulation. Tetralogy of Fallot's and Transposition of great vessels both can cause central cyanosis. However, the presence of a short systolic murmur is more indicative of Tetralogy of Fallot's, as Transposition of great vessels often presents with no murmur. Atrial septal defect and Ventricular Septal defect typically do not cause cyanosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Tetralogy of Fallot's\"}"
