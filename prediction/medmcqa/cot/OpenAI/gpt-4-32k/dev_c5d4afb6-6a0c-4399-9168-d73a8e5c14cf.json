    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child's symptoms suggest a Class II malocclusion, characterized by a small chin, distal step 2nd molar relation, and narrow maxilla. The normal SNA angle indicates a normal maxillary position, while the decreased SNB angle suggests a retrusive mandible. The low FMA angle indicates a low mandibular plane angle, which is common in Class II malocclusions. The child is too young for most orthodontic treatments, which are usually started after the eruption of permanent teeth. However, functional appliances like the FR II appliance can be used in growing children to modify skeletal growth and improve mandibular position. The Kloehn headgear is used to treat maxillary protrusion, which is not the case here. The Twin block appliance is also used for Class II malocclusions, but it is more suitable for older children. Waiting for 6 years without any intervention is not advisable as it may lead to worsening of the condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. FR II appliance\"}"
