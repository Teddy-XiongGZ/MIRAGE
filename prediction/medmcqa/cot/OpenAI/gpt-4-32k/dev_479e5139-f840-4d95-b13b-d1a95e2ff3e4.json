    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiosensitivity refers to the susceptibility of cells, tissues, or organs to damage from radiation. The radiosensitivity of an organ is determined by the rate of cell turnover. Organs with a high rate of cell turnover, such as the ovaries, are more radiosensitive. However, in the context of pelvic irradiation, the ovaries are often not the most affected due to their position, which is usually shielded. The bladder, vagina, and rectum are more directly exposed to the radiation. Among these, the rectum and bladder have a higher cell turnover rate than the vagina, making them more radiosensitive. However, the rectum is slightly more radiosensitive than the bladder due to its higher cell turnover and direct exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Rectum\"}"
