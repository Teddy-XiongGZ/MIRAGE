    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-linking in resins refers to the process of chemically bonding the polymer chains together. This process results in a three-dimensional network of connected molecules. This network increases the strength of the material because it is harder to break the bonds between the molecules. It also increases the hardness of the material because the cross-linked molecules are more resistant to deformation. Finally, it increases crazing resistance because the cross-linked molecules are less likely to form micro-cracks under stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above\"}"
