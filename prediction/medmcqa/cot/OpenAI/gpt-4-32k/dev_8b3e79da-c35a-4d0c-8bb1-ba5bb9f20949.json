    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protein precipitation is a method used to concentrate proteins and reduce the volume of the samples. Trichloroacetic acid (A) is a commonly used reagent for protein precipitation. Heat precipitation (B) is a method where heat is used to denature the proteins and cause them to precipitate. Isoelectric point method (C) is a technique where the pH of the solution is adjusted to the isoelectric point of the protein, causing it to precipitate. However, titration with reducing sugar (D) is not a method used for protein precipitation. It is a method used to determine the concentration of reducing sugars in a solution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
