    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The intrinsic pathway of the clotting mechanism involves several clotting factors, including factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a test that measures the efficiency of these factors and thus, the integrity of the intrinsic pathway. Bleeding time is a measure of platelet function, not the intrinsic pathway. Prothrombin time measures the extrinsic pathway and common pathway. Clotting time is a nonspecific test and does not specifically measure the intrinsic pathway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. aPTT\"}"
