    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mosaic pattern of bone is a radiographic feature where the bone appears to have a patchwork of mixed sclerotic and lucent areas. This is not a feature of fibrous dysplasia, which typically presents with a 'ground glass' appearance. Osteopetrosis, also known as 'marble bone disease', is characterized by diffusely sclerotic bones due to defective osteoclasts, and does not present with a mosaic pattern. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones that fracture easily, and it also does not present with a mosaic pattern. Paget's disease, on the other hand, is a chronic disorder that can result in enlarged and misshapen bones. The mosaic pattern is a characteristic feature of Paget's disease due to irregular bone remodeling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Paget's disease\"}"
