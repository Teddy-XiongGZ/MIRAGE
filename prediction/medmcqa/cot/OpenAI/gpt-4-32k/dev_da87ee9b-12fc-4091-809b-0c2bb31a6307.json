    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mechanical trituration of amalgam is the process of mixing mercury with an alloy powder to form a dental filling. This process does not affect the hardness of the filling, as this is determined by the alloy composition. It also does not affect the tarnish resistance, which is also determined by the alloy used. The final gloss of the filling is not affected by the trituration process, but rather by the polishing process after the filling has hardened. However, the working time, or the time available to place and shape the filling before it hardens, can be affected by the trituration process. Over-trituration can cause the amalgam to harden too quickly, reducing the working time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
