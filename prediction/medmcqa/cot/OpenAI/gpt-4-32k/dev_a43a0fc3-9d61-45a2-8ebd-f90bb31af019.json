    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Kiesselbach's plexus, also known as Little's area, is an anastomotic network of blood vessels in the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum. It receives blood supply from four arteries: the sphenopalatine artery, the greater palatine artery, the anterior ethmoidal artery, and the septal branch of the superior labial artery. Therefore, all of the options except the anterior ethmoidal artery are branches of the external carotid artery that contribute to Kiesselbach's plexus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
