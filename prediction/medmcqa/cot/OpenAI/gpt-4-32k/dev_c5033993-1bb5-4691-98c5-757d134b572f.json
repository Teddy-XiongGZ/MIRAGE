    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to dry mouth and dry eyes. The disease is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of these glands, leading to decreased glandular function. This would result in a decreased output of salivary glands. The composition of saliva in Sjogren's syndrome is also altered. There is an increase in sodium and phosphate concentration due to decreased water content. However, the concentration of IgA, an immunoglobulin that plays a crucial role in the immune function of mucous membranes, is typically decreased in Sjogren's syndrome, not increased.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
