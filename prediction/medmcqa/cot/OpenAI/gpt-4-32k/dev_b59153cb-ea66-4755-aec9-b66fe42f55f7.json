    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Developing a dental radiograph involves a chemical process that precipitates metallic silver, so option A is true. If the development process is too long, it can result in an over dark radiograph, so option B is also true. High temperatures during the development process can cause a fogged, over dark radiograph, so option C is true. However, sodium thiosulphate is typically used in the fixer, not the developer, during the radiograph development process. Therefore, option D is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
