    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maculopapular rash is a type of rash characterized by a flat, red area on the skin that is covered with small confluent bumps. It is often seen in viral infections. Dengue, Rubella, and Measles are all viral infections that can present with a maculopapular rash. Zoster, on the other hand, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. It presents with a painful, blistering rash, not a maculopapular rash.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Zoster\"}"
