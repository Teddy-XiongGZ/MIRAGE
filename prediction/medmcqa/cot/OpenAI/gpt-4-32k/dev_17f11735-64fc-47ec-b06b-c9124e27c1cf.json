    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the best radiographic view for diagnosing horizontally favorable and unfavorable fractures. These are typically fractures of the mandible. The OPG (Orthopantomogram) is a panoramic scanning dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two-dimensional view. The Occlusal view is used to visualize the occlusal plane of either the maxilla or mandible. The Lateral Oblique view is used to visualize the body and ramus of the mandible. The Transpharyngeal view is used to visualize the condylar process of the mandible. Considering these, the Lateral Oblique view is the best choice for diagnosing horizontally favorable and unfavorable fractures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
