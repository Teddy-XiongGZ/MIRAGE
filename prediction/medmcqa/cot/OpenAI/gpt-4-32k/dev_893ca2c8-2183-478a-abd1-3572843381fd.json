    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lathe cut silver alloy is a type of dental amalgam. It does not require the least amount of mercury, so option A is incorrect. It does not achieve the lowest compressive strength at 1 hour, so option B is also incorrect. The tensile strength of lathe cut silver alloy is not comparable to high copper unicompositional alloy, so option C is incorrect. However, lathe cut silver alloy is known for its low creep, which means it has a low tendency to gradually deform under the influence of stress, so option D is correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
