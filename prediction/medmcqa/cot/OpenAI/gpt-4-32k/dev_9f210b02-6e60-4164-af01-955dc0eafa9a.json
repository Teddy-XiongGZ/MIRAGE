    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentinal tubules are microscopic canals that run from the outside of the tooth to the nerve in the center. The inner pulpal layer does contain more dentinal tubules than the outer dentin layer, so option A is true. The diameter of dentinal tubules is indeed more at the pulpal layer than the outer layer, so option C is also true. Bonding is more difficult on the inner layer of dentin compared to the outer surface, so option D is true. However, the diameter of dentin tubules is not as large as 5 to 7\u03bcm. It is typically around 1 to 2.5 \u03bcm. Therefore, option B is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
