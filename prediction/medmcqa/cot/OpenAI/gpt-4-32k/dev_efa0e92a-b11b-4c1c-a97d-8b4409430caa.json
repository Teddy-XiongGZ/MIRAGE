    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"IOPA stands for Intraoral Periapical Radiography. The resolution of IOPA is measured in line pairs per millimeter (Lp/mm). The resolution of IOPA is not as high as 30 Lp/mm or 28 Lp/mm. It's also not as low as 10 Lp/mm. Therefore, the resolution of IOPA is most likely 16 Lp/mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
