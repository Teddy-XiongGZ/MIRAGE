    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lead poisoning inhibits several enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, including delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase. This results in the accumulation of the substrates of these enzymes. Delta-aminolevulinic acid is a substrate for delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, so its levels would increase in the blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Delta amino levulinic acid\"}"
