    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A chemically cured composite is often used for core build up on a molar tooth because of its specific properties. A. Light cure resin does not necessarily lack sufficient strength for a core. B. The opacity and esthetics of the core are not the primary concern, especially for a molar tooth which is not easily visible. C. Light cure resin is not necessarily too brittle and would fracture easily. D. The lower viscosity of chemically cured composite allows free flow of resin around pins and post, ensuring a more secure and stable core build up.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
