    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Elastin is a protein in connective tissue that allows many tissues in the body to resume their shape after stretching or contracting. It helps skin to return to its original position when it is poked or pinched. Elastin also helps lungs to recoil back to their original shape after being stretched during breathing. Abnormalities in elastin protein can lead to joint laxity, aortic aneurysm, and subluxation of lens as these conditions involve tissues that require elasticity. However, fractures are typically related to abnormalities in bone density and strength, not elasticity, so they are not typically associated with abnormalities in elastin protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
