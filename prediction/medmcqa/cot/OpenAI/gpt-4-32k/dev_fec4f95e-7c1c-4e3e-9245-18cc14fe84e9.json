    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is released from the presynaptic membrane into the synaptic cleft. The release of acetylcholine is triggered by the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) into the presynaptic neuron. This occurs when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, causing voltage-gated calcium channels to open. Therefore, blocking these channels would actually decrease the release of acetylcholine. Blocking sodium, potassium, or chloride channels would not directly affect the release of acetylcholine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
