    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Firstly, it's important to note that newborns should start urinating within the first 24 hours after birth. If a newborn has not passed urine for 36 hours, it could indicate a problem with the urinary system. The first step would be to use a non-invasive method to check the kidneys and bladder. An ultrasound is a safe and effective way to visualize these organs in a newborn. A CT scan, while effective, exposes the child to radiation, which is not ideal. Cystoscopy is an invasive procedure and would not be the first choice. An X-ray of the pelvis would not provide as much detailed information about the kidneys and bladder as an ultrasound would.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
