    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor organ that senses changes in muscle tension. It lies at the origins and insertion of skeletal muscle fibers into the tendons of skeletal muscle. It does not detect length change, that's the function of muscle spindles. It does not have a dynamic response only, it responds to both static and dynamic changes. It does not have a high threshold, it's quite sensitive to changes in tension. The Golgi tendon organ is connected to between 3-25 muscle fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
