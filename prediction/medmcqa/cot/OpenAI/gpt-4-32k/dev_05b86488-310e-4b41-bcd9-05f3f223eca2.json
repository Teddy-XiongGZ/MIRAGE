    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main concern during prosthodontics surgery and for a better prosthetic prognosis is not continuity defects, as these are more related to bone or tissue loss. Cost is also not the main concern, as it is more of a patient's personal concern rather than a medical one.

Proper occlusion is crucial for the proper functioning and longevity of the prosthetic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Occlusion\"}"
