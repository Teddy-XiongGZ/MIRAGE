    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phenytoin, Phenobarbitone, Carbamazepine, and Valproate are all anti-epileptic drugs. However, all of these drugs have been associated with congenital malformations when used in pregnant women. Phenytoin is associated with fetal hydantoin syndrome, which can cause growth deficiencies, mental retardation, and craniofacial abnormalities. Phenobarbitone is associated with neonatal withdrawal syndrome and possible cognitive impairment. Carbamazepine is associated with neural tube defects. Valproate is associated with neural tube defects, craniofacial defects, and cognitive impairment. Therefore, none of these drugs are safe to use in pregnancy without risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
