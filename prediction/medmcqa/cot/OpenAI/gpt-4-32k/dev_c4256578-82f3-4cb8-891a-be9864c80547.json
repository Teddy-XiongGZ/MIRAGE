    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heparin is an anticoagulant medication that is commonly used to prevent blood clots in patients after surgery. The most common route of administration for heparin is either subcutaneous or intravenous. However, for post-operative thromboprophylaxis, the subcutaneous route is preferred because it provides a more stable and sustained anticoagulant effect, which is ideal for preventing blood clots over a longer period. Intravenous administration is typically reserved for situations that require immediate anticoagulation. Inhalational and intramuscular routes are not commonly used for heparin administration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Subcutaneous\"}"
