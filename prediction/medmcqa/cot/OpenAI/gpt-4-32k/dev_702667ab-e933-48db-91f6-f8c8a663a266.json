    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The balance of a hand instrument is important for precision and control during use. The balance is determined by the alignment of the blade edge with the axis of the instrument. The axis of the instrument is not the handle, but the shank, which is the part of the instrument that connects the handle to the blade. Therefore, the blade edge should be within a certain distance of the axis of the shank, not the handle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Blade edge should be within 2 mm of the axis of shank\"}"
