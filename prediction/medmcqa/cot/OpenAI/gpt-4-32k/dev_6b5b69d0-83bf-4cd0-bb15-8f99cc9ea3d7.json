    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Parathyroid hormone is involved in calcium homeostasis, not in the regulation of heart sensitivity to epinephrine. Insulin is involved in glucose metabolism and does not directly affect the heart's sensitivity to epinephrine. Glucagon is involved in raising the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream, and it does not increase the sensitivity of the heart to epinephrine. Thyroid hormones, on the other hand, increase the overall metabolic rate and can increase the sensitivity of the heart to epinephrine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Thyroid\"}"
