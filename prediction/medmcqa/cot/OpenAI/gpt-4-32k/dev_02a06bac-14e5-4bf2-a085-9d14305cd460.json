    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Impression compound is a material used in dentistry for taking impressions of teeth and oral tissues. It has a high thermal conductivity because it needs to be heated before use to make it malleable. It does not have a high flow property, as it is a rigid material once cooled. It does not degrade in the presence of moisture, as it is designed to be used in the oral environment which is naturally moist. It does not remain distortion free for up to 72 hours, as it is recommended to pour the impression as soon as possible to avoid distortion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
