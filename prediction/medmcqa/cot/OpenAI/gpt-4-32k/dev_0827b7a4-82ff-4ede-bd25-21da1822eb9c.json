    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Skeletal muscles contract through a process known as the sliding filament theory. This involves the interaction of actin and myosin filaments, but these filaments do not shorten during contraction, they slide past each other. Therefore, option B is incorrect. The contraction of skeletal muscles is initiated when calcium ions bind to troponin, a protein that is part of the thin filament. When calcium binds to troponin, it causes a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin molecules, allowing myosin to bind to actin and initiate muscle contraction. Therefore, option C is correct. Calcium does not bind to tropomyosin to initiate contraction, so option D is incorrect. Finally, the uptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum actually causes muscle relaxation, not contraction, so option A is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
