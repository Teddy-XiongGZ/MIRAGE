    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardiac tamponade is a serious medical condition in which blood or fluids fill the space between the sac that encases the heart and the heart muscle. This places extreme pressure on your heart. The pressure prevents the heart's ventricles from expanding fully and keeps your heart from functioning properly. Your heart may also not be able to pump enough blood to your body, which can lead to organ failure, shock, and death. Therefore, it is important to keep the patient calm and relaxed during the blood pressure measurement. Holding breath or long and deep breathing can alter the blood pressure readings. Short and shallow breaths can cause hyperventilation which is not good for a cardiac patient. Therefore, the patient should be advised to breathe normally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Breathe normally\"}"
