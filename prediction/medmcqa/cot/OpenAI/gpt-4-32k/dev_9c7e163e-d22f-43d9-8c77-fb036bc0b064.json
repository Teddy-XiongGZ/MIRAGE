    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient had a myocardial infarction 2 weeks ago, so the primary goal is to lower LDL cholesterol to prevent further cardiovascular events. Statins are the first-line therapy for this. The patient's LDL is 126 mg/dL, which is above the recommended level for someone with a history of heart disease. Therefore, a high-intensity statin is needed. Atorvastatin 80 mg is a high-intensity statin that can lower LDL by more than 50%. The patient's triglycerides are also high, but statins can also help lower triglycerides. Therefore, the combination of Rosuvastatin and Fenofibrate is not necessary in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Atorvastatin 80 mg\"}"
