    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CSF Rhinorrhoea is a condition where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks through the nose. This can occur due to a head injury, surgery, or a spontaneous leak. Immediate treatment usually involves conservative management to allow the body to heal the leak on its own. This often includes bed rest, avoiding activities that may increase intracranial pressure such as bending, lifting, or straining, and sometimes antibiotics to prevent infection. Blowing the nose can increase the leak and is not recommended. Plugging with paraffin gauge or craniotomy are not immediate treatments and are usually considered if conservative management fails.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Antibiotics and observation\"}"
