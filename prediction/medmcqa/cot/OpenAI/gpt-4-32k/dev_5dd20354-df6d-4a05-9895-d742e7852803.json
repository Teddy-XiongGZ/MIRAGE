    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reversible contraceptives are methods that prevent pregnancy and can be stopped at any time without lasting effects on fertility. Copper T, LNG-IUS, and Implanon are all types of reversible contraceptives. Copper T is an intrauterine device (IUD) that can be removed at any time. LNG-IUS is also an IUD, and Implanon is a hormonal implant that can also be removed. On the other hand, laparoscopic tubal ligation is a surgical procedure that involves blocking or sealing the fallopian tubes. This procedure is generally considered permanent and not easily reversible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
