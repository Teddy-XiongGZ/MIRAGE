    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a post-disaster scenario, the risk of disease outbreaks increases due to factors such as overcrowding, poor sanitation, and lack of access to clean water. Cholera and typhoid are both waterborne diseases, so they could potentially be a concern. However, these diseases are not typically the focus of mass vaccination campaigns because they can be prevented through improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene. Measles, on the other hand, is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in crowded conditions, making it a major concern in post-disaster situations. Vaccination against measles is therefore often prioritized in these settings. Scrub typhus is a disease that is spread by mites, and it is not typically a concern in post-disaster situations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Measles\"}"
