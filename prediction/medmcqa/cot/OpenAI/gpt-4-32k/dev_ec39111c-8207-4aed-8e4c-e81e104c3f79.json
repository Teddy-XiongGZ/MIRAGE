    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dental lamina is a band of oral epithelium from which the tooth buds grow. It is not initiated by the forebrain or Rathke's pouch, which are related to the development of the brain and pituitary gland respectively. Odontoblasts are involved in the formation of dentin in the tooth, but they are not responsible for initiating the formation of the dental lamina. Neural crest cells, on the other hand, migrate to the oral cavity and interact with the oral epithelium to initiate the formation of the dental lamina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Neural crest cells\"}"
