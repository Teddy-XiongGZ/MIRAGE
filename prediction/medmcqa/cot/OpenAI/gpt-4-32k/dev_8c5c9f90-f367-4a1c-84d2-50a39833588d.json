    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lesion described is a pedunculated lesion, meaning it is attached to the soft palate by a stalk or stem. It has a rough, 'warty' surface but is the same color as the adjacent mucosa, which suggests it might not be malignant. However, the only way to confirm this is through a biopsy. An incisional biopsy would only remove a part of the lesion, which might not be representative of the whole lesion. An excisional biopsy, on the other hand, would remove the entire lesion and would therefore provide a more accurate diagnosis. Exfoliative cytology, which involves scraping cells from the surface of the lesion, might not provide a definitive diagnosis because it might not capture cells from deeper within the lesion. Observing the lesion for two weeks without taking any action is not advisable because if the lesion is malignant, it could grow and spread during this time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Perform excisional biopsy\"}"
