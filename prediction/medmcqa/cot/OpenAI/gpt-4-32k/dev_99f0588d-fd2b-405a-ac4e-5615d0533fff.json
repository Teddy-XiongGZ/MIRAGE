    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a patient who underwent surgery at the lateral part of the skull and postoperatively had aspirations without voice change. This suggests that the nerve affected is involved in swallowing but not in voice modulation. The Vagus nerve (A) is involved in both swallowing and voice modulation, so it's not the best choice. The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (RLN) (B) is primarily involved in voice modulation, so it's also not the best choice. The Glossopharyngeal nerve (C) is involved in swallowing but not voice modulation, making it the most likely choice. The Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN) (D) is involved in voice modulation, so it's not the best choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
