    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder that affects the teeth. It is characterized by translucent or discolored teeth (most often blue-gray or yellow-brown), and is associated with weak, brittle teeth that wear away quickly. There are three types of dentinogenesis imperfecta: Type I, Type II, and Type III. All three types can lead to complete obliteration of the pulp. Dentin dysplasia, on the other hand, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the formation of teeth. It is characterized by abnormal dentin formation, leading to discolored, loose, or missing teeth. However, it does not typically lead to complete obliteration of the pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Dentin dysplasia\"}"
