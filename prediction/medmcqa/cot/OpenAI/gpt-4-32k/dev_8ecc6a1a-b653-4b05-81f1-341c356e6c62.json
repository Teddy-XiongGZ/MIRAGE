    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin is a hormone that is composed of two chains, A and B, which are linked together by disulfide bonds. The A chain has 21 amino acids and the B chain has 30. The function of insulin is highly dependent on its structure, and any changes in the structure can potentially alter its function. Interchanging the positions of amino acids in the insulin molecule could potentially disrupt the structure and function of insulin. However, the least disruptive change would likely be the one that involves the interchange of amino acids that are closest to each other in the sequence. In this case, that would be the interchange of A5 and A6.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
