    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The base deficit is a measure of the amount of base (usually bicarbonate) that is below the normal range in the body. The normal range for bicarbonate (HCO3-) is 22-28 mEq/L. In this case, the patient's bicarbonate level is 6 mEq/L. Therefore, the base deficit can be calculated as the difference between the lower limit of the normal range (22 mEq/L) and the patient's bicarbonate level. This gives a base deficit per liter of blood. To find the total base deficit in the body, we need to multiply this by the estimated blood volume of the patient. The estimated blood volume in an average adult is approximately 70 ml/kg, so for a 75 kg patient, the estimated blood volume is 5250 ml or 5.25 L. Therefore, the total base deficit in the body is the base deficit per liter multiplied by the total blood volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 400 mEq\"}"
