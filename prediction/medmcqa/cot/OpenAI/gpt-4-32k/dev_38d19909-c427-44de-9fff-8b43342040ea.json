    "The net filtration pressure (NFP) in the kidneys is calculated using the formula: NFP = (PGC - PBC) - pGC, where PGC is the glomerular capillary blood pressure, PBC is the bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure, and pGC is the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure. Given the values: PGC = 42 mm Hg, pGC = 12 mm Hg, PBC = 16 mm Hg, we can substitute these into the formula: NFP = (42 - 16) - 12 = 14 mm Hg Therefore, the net filtration pressure is 14 mm Hg. So, the answer is C. 14 mm Hg. The output in json format would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I used the formula for net filtration pressure, which is NFP = (PGC - PBC) - pGC. Then, I substituted the given values into the formula: NFP = (42 - 16) - 12 = 14 mm Hg. Therefore, the net filtration pressure is 14 mm Hg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
