    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apical migration of the epithelial attachment refers to the downward movement of the point at which the gingival tissue attaches to the tooth. This is often accompanied by the recession of the marginal gingiva, which is the edge of the gum tissue that surrounds the teeth. This process results in the formation of a periodontal pocket, which is a gap that forms between the tooth and gum tissue. This pocket can harbor bacteria and lead to further periodontal disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Periodontal pocket formation\"}"
