    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Supplementary retention on the abutment tooth refers to additional measures taken to ensure the stability and retention of a dental prosthesis on the abutment tooth. Greater bulk of metal would not necessarily provide supplementary retention, it might even cause discomfort or other issues. Proper cementation technique is important for the overall retention and stability of the prosthesis, but it's not a supplementary retention method. Shoulder preparation is a method used to shape the abutment tooth for the prosthesis, but it doesn't provide supplementary retention. The proper use of pins and grooves, however, can provide additional retention by creating mechanical interlocks between the prosthesis and the abutment tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
