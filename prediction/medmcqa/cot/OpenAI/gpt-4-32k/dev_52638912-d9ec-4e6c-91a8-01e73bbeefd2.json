    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Uniparental disomy (UPD) is a situation in which both copies of a chromosome or part of a chromosome come from the same parent, instead of one copy coming from the mother and one from the father. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are both associated with UPD, specifically of chromosome 15. Russell-Silver syndrome is also associated with UPD, specifically of chromosome 7 or 11. However, Bloom syndrome is not associated with UPD. Instead, it is caused by mutations in the BLM gene, which is involved in DNA repair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bloom syndrome\"}"
