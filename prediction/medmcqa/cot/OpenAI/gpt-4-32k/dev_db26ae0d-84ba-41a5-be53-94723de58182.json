    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Burch operation is a surgical procedure typically performed to treat stress urinary incontinence. In this scenario, there is significant bleeding and pooling of blood in the space of Retzius, which is an anatomical space in the pelvic region. The source of bleeding cannot be visualized. The next step in management should be to control the bleeding. Calling a vascular surgeon (option A) might be necessary in some cases, but it's not the immediate next step. Giving a generalized suture in the bleeding area (option B) is not advisable because the source of bleeding is not visualized. Placing a surgical drain (option D) is not the immediate step to control active bleeding. Lifting the endopelvic fascia by putting fingers in the vagina (option C) can help to tamponade the bleeding and allow for better visualization of the surgical field.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
