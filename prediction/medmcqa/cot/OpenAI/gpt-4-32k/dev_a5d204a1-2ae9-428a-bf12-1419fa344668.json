    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand that bone cancer is a malignant tumor that originates in any bone in the body. There are several types of bone cancer, but the most common ones are osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and multiple myeloma. However, metastatic bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bone from other parts of the body, is more common than primary bone cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer, not bone cancer. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies. It often affects multiple bones in the body, but it's not the most common. Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer, but it's not as common as metastatic bone cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metastatic bone cancer\"}"
