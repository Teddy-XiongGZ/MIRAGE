    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Occlusal equilibration is the process of adjusting the biting surfaces of teeth to create a harmonious relationship between the upper and lower teeth. This is done by selectively grinding high spots or interferences that prevent the teeth from fitting together properly. The choice of which area to reduce depends on where the interferences are located. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine whether the interferences are on the upper or lower teeth, or whether they are on the buccal (cheek side) or lingual (tongue side) surfaces of the teeth. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to definitively answer this question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not enough information\"}"
