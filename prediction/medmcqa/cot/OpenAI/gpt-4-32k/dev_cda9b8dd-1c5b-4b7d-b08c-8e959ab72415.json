    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GnRH agonists are used in a variety of conditions where suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is beneficial. This includes endometriosis (A), where the goal is to reduce estrogen production and thus reduce endometrial tissue growth. In infertility (B), GnRH agonists are used in assisted reproductive technologies to control the timing of ovulation. In precocious puberty (C), they are used to delay the onset of puberty. However, in prostate cancer (D), continuous administration of GnRH agonists can initially cause a surge in testosterone levels, which can exacerbate the disease. Therefore, they are typically used in a pulsatile manner in this condition to avoid this initial surge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
