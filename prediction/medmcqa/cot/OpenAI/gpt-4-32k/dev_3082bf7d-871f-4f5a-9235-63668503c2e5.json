    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The stapedial reflex is a response of the muscles attached to the stapes bone in the ear to loud sounds, which helps to protect the inner ear from damage. The nerve root that controls this reflex is not a specific nerve root, but rather a complex of neurons in the brainstem. The superior olivary complex is part of the auditory pathway in the brainstem and is involved in the processing of sound. It is responsible for the stapedial reflex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
