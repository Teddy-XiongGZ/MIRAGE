    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Perfusion of a free flap is crucial to monitor to ensure the flap is receiving adequate blood flow. A pulse oximeter (A) measures oxygen saturation, but it does not directly measure blood flow. A prick test (C) is a crude method of assessing perfusion and is not the best choice. Flourescin & dermo flourometer (D) can be used to assess perfusion, but it is not as accurate and immediate as other methods. Laser Doppler velocimetry (B) is a non-invasive method that measures the speed and direction of blood flow in real-time, making it the best choice for monitoring perfusion of a free flap.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
