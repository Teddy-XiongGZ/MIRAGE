    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resorption of roots of the primary teeth is a natural process that allows for the exfoliation of primary teeth and the eruption of permanent teeth. The dental pulp does not initiate this process; it is initiated by odontoclasts, which are cells that resorb the hard tissues of the tooth. The dental pulp does not become a fibrotic non-vital mass during this process. It also does not aid in the formation of secondary dentin to slow down resorption. Therefore, the dental pulp plays a passive role in the resorption of roots of the primary teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
