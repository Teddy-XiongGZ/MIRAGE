    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a neurological scale that aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person. The scale ranges from 3 to 15, with 3 being the worst possible score (deep coma or death) and 15 being the best (fully awake person). Endotracheal intubation is typically performed on patients who are unconscious or semi-conscious, which means their GCS score would be on the lower end of the scale. A GCS score of 8 or less is generally considered severe, indicating coma or decreased consciousness. Therefore, if a patient has been intubated, it's likely that their GCS score is 8 or less.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
