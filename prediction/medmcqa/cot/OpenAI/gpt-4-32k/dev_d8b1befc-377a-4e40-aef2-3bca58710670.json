    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rinne's test is used to compare air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) of sound. Normally, air conduction is greater than bone conduction, which is what we see in this patient. However, the Weber test, which is used to detect unilateral conductive hearing loss and unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, is lateralizing to the right ear. This suggests that there might be some issue with the right ear. The next logical step would not be to consider this a normal test, because the Weber test is abnormal. Wax removal is not the next step unless there is a specific reason to suspect wax buildup. Repeating the Rinne's test on the right side might not provide new information, as it was already performed on both sides. The Schwabach's test is another test that compares a patient's hearing by bone conduction to that of an examiner with normal hearing. It could provide additional information about the patient's bone conduction hearing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Schwabach's test\"}"
