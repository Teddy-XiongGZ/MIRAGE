    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Traumatic occlusal forces refer to excessive or misdirected forces that are applied to the teeth, which can lead to changes in the alveolar bone. The alveolar bone responds to these forces through a process called bone remodeling. This process involves the activity of osteoblasts, which are cells that form new bone, and osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone. In areas of tension, where the bone is being pulled, osteoblasts are active to form new bone. In areas of pressure, where the bone is being compressed, osteoclasts are active to break down bone. Therefore, the correct answer is that alveolar bone has osteoblasts in areas of tension and osteoclasts in areas of pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
