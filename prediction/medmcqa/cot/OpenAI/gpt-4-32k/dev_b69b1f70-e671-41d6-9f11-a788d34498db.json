    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-translational modification is a process in which proteins undergo further modification after translation. This can include the addition of functional groups, such as phosphate, acetate, or carboxyl groups, among others. Selenocysteine, hydroxy-proline, and hydroxy-lysine are all examples of amino acids that undergo post-translational modification. Selenocysteine is incorporated into proteins during translation, replacing a specific serine or cysteine codon. Hydroxy-proline and hydroxy-lysine are both formed by the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, respectively. On the other hand, Triiodothyronine is not an amino acid, but a thyroid hormone that is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Triiodothyronine\"}"
