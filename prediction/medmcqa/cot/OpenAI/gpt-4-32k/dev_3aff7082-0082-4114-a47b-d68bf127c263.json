    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the eye's optic nerve and gets worse over time. It's often linked to a buildup of pressure inside the eye. The optic nerve carries visual information from the eye to the brain. The cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy are the ganglion cells, which are the final output neurons of the vertebrate retina. They collect visual information in their dendrites from bipolar cells and amacrine cells and transmit it to the brain through their axon to the brain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Ganglion cells\"}"
