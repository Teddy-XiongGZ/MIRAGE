    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tubercular meningitis is a severe form of tuberculosis that affects the meninges, the protective layers of the brain and spinal cord. If a patient's condition deteriorates after a month of treatment, it's important to investigate the cause. An MRI can provide detailed images of the brain and help identify any changes or complications. A NCCT (Non-Contrast Computed Tomography) can also provide images of the brain and is particularly useful in detecting bleeding. A CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) examination can help identify any infection or inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. Liver function tests, while important in monitoring the side effects of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), are not typically part of an emergency evaluation for a deteriorating neurological condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
