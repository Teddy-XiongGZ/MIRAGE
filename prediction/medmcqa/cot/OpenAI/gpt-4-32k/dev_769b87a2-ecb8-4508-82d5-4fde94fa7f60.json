    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluoride in drinking water affects the development and mineralization of teeth. Primary teeth start to develop in utero and finish developing by the age of 3 years. Permanent teeth, except third molars, start developing in utero and finish by the age of 8 years. Third molars, also known as wisdom teeth, start developing around the age of 8-10 years.
