    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A transverse symphyseal fracture of the mandible is a type of fracture that occurs in the lower jaw. The management of this type of fracture often involves the use of various types of plates and screws to stabilize the fracture and promote healing. Lag screws, 2 mm compression plates, and 1.5 mm single miniplates are all commonly used in the management of these fractures. However, a 2.5 mm monocortical plate is not typically used in the management of a transverse symphyseal fracture of the mandible. This is because monocortical plates are not as strong as bicortical plates and may not provide adequate stability for this type of fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
