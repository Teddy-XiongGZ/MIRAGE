    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of imbalance when walking with eyes closed and having to lift up the foot and stomp on the ground to walk are indicative of a problem with proprioception, or the body's ability to sense its own position in space. This is typically associated with the dorsal column tract, which carries information about touch and proprioception from the body to the brain. The spinocerebellar tract is involved in coordinating movement, but it does not directly affect proprioception. The lateral spinothalamic tract is involved in pain and temperature sensation, not proprioception. The vestibulospinal tract is involved in maintaining balance, but it does not directly affect proprioception.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dorsal column tract\"}"
