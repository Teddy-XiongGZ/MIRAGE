    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The interphalangeal joint of the thumb is primarily innervated by the median nerve. The median nerve is responsible for the flexion of the thumb, and it is the nerve that passes through the supracondylar region of the humerus. Therefore, a supracondylar humerus fracture could potentially damage the median nerve, leading to an inability to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Median nerve\"}"
