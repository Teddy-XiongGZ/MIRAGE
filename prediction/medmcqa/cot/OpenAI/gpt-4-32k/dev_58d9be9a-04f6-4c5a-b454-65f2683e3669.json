    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of digestion involves breaking down food into nutrients that the body can use. This process begins in the mouth and continues in the stomach, but the majority of nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine.

The stomach does some absorption, but it's primarily involved in breaking down food.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
