    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluoride is a poison that can cause serious harm if ingested in large amounts. The best immediate action is to try to neutralize the fluoride. Water will not neutralize the fluoride, it will only dilute it. Sodium bicarbonate solution could potentially neutralize the fluoride, but it's not safe to have a child drink a 100% sodium bicarbonate solution. Milk or other calcium containing liquids can bind to the fluoride and prevent it from being absorbed into the body. Sending the child to the family physician is important, but it's not the most immediate action that should be taken.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
