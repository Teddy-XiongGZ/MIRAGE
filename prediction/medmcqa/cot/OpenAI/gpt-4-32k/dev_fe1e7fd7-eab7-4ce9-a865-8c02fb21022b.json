    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulpectomy and pulp capping are procedures related to the pulp of the tooth. The pulp is the part of the tooth that contains blood vessels and nerves. The success of these procedures in primary teeth is not related to the volume of pulp in primary teeth, as the pulp chamber is actually larger in permanent teeth. The amount of collagen fibers in the young is also not a significant factor in the success of these procedures. However, the increased blood supply through the wide apex in primary teeth can contribute to better healing and success of these procedures. The increased odontoblastic activity in the young can also contribute to the success of these procedures, as odontoblasts are responsible for the formation of dentin, which is crucial for the success of pulp capping and pulpectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Increased blood supply through the wide apex\"}"
