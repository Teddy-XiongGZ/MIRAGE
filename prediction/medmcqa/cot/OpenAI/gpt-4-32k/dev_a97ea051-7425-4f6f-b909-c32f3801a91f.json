    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of receptors that respond to a variety of stimuli and can activate several different signaling pathways. The muscarinic M2 receptor, dopamine D2 receptor, and serotonin 5 HT 1 receptor are all GPCRs that are known to act through the opening of potassium channels. The angiotensin 1 receptor, on the other hand, is a GPCR that primarily acts through the activation of phospholipase C, which leads to the production of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, not the opening of potassium channels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Angiotensin 1 receptor\"}"
