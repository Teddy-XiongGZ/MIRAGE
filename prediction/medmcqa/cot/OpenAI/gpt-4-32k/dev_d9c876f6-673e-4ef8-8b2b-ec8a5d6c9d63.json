    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a stable, non-pulsatile retroperitoneal hematoma, which suggests that there is no active bleeding. The IVU shows a barely discernible nephrogram on the right side, which suggests that there may be an issue with the kidney on that side. However, the patient is stable and there is no active bleeding, so there is no immediate need for a nephrectomy. Opening the Gerota's fascia and exploring the kidney could potentially cause more harm than good, especially if the hematoma is stable. On table angiography would be more invasive and may not provide additional useful information. Therefore, the best next step would be to perform on table retrograde pyelography, which would allow for visualization of the urinary tract and potentially identify any issues with the kidney.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Perform on table retrograde pyelography\"}"
