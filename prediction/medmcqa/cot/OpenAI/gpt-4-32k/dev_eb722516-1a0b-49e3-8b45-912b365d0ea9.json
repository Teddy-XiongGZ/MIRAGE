    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PPS stands for Pterygopalatine fossa. It is an anatomical structure in the skull. It is not related to the pterygomaxillary notches, fovea palatine, or PN5. It also does not refer to the maxillary tuberosity or the pterygornaxillary raphae. The posterior limit of the palatine bone is also not the correct answer because the PPS is a specific area in the skull that is not defined by the posterior limit of the palatine bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
