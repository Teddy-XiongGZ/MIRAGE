    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been on haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, for several days. The symptoms described, inner restlessness and urges to move, are indicative of a condition known as akathisia. This is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications. Tardive dyskinesia typically presents with involuntary, repetitive body movements and would not be described as an urge to move. Rabbit syndrome is a rare form of extrapyramidal side effect associated with antipsychotic medication, characterized by rapid movements of the lips mimicking the chewing movements of a rabbit, which is not the case here. Acute dystonia is a condition of sudden, involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle group, which also doesn't match the symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
