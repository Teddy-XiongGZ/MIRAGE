    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The larval phase of helminths like Ancylostoma, Strongyloides, and Ascaris involves migration through the body, often through the lungs. This can cause inflammation and symptoms similar to pneumonia, known as pneumonitis. Asymptomatic means there are no symptoms, which is not the most common. Liver failure is not typically associated with these parasites. Larva migrans is a condition caused by the migration of the larvae, not a symptom.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pneumonitis\"}"
