They are typically applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth where decay occurs most often. Initial caries refers to the first stage of a cavity, before it has progressed to the dentin.

Secondary, recurrent, and rampant caries refer to more advanced stages of decay, which sealants cannot treat.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Initial caries\"}"
