    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rh isoimmunisation is a condition that occurs when a woman with Rh-negative blood type is exposed to Rh-positive blood, leading to the development of antibodies against the Rh antigen. The Rh antigen is also known as the D antigen, so anti-D would be affected by Rh isoimmunisation. Anti-C and Anti-E are also part of the Rh blood group system, so they would be affected as well. Anti-Lewis, on the other hand, is not part of the Rh blood group system, so it would not be affected by Rh isoimmunisation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Anti lewis\"}"
