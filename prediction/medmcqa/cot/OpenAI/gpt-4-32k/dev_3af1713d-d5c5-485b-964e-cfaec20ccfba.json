    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand the question. It's asking for a term that describes a radio opaque area found at the root apex of young permanent teeth involved with chronic pulpitis. Chronic pulpitis is a long-standing inflammation of the dental pulp. This inflammation can lead to changes in the surrounding bone. Apical refers to the apex or tip of the root of a tooth. Radio opaque areas in radiographs indicate denser structures, often related to some form of pathology. Now, let's go through the options. Apical cyst is a type of radicular cyst that occurs at the apex of a tooth root, usually resulting from necrosis of the pulp. Apical condensing osteitis is a reaction of the bone surrounding the apex of a tooth, often seen in response to low-grade inflammation such as chronic pulpitis. It appears as a radio-opaque area on radiographs. Chronic apical periodontitis is an inflammatory disorder caused by bacteria residing in the dental pulp, but it doesn't necessarily cause a radio-opaque area. Stage one apical osteofibroses is not a recognized term in dental pathology. Therefore, the most fitting answer is apical condensing osteitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
