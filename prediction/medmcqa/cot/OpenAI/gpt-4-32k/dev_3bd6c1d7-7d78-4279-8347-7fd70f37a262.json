    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of muscle contraction involves several steps. The myosin head attaches to the actin filament to form a cross-bridge, then it pulls the actin filament towards the center of the sarcomere, causing muscle contraction. This is powered by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. However, the detachment of the myosin head from actin is triggered by the binding of a new ATP molecule to the myosin head. This causes a change in the conformation of the myosin head, allowing it to release from the actin filament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Binding of ATP to head\"}"
