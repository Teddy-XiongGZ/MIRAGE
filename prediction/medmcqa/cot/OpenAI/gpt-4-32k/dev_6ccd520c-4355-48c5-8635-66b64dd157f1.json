    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anteroposterior relationship of the jaws is a measure of how the upper and lower jaws relate to each other in a front to back direction. This is typically measured using cephalometric analysis in orthodontics. The ANB angle is a cephalometric measurement that represents the anteroposterior relationship of the maxilla and the mandible. The other options, such as the angle between SN & FH Plane, the angle between SN & mandibular plane, and the facial angle, are also cephalometric measurements, but they do not specifically measure the anteroposterior relationship of the jaws.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. ANB angle\"}"
