    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"AS stands for Aortic Stenosis. In severe cases of Aortic Stenosis, the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed aortic valve, which can cause the left ventricle to enlarge and thicken. This can lead to a heaving, or forceful, heartbeat that can be felt at the apex of the heart, which may also be shifted due to the enlargement of the heart. Pulsus bisferiens is typically associated with aortic regurgitation, not stenosis. A late ejection systolic click is more commonly associated with mitral valve prolapse. A loud S2 is not typically associated with aortic stenosis, as S2 represents the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves and would not be affected by stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
