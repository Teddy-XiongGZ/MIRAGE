    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 'a' wave of the jugular venous pulse (JVP) corresponds to atrial contraction, which occurs just before the first heart sound and the rapid ejection phase. The first heart sound and rapid ejection phase are followed by the R wave of the ECG, which represents ventricular depolarization. The T wave of the ECG, which represents ventricular repolarization, comes after the R wave.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C, A, B\"}"
