    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcification is a process that involves the deposition of calcium salts, which often occurs in bone formation. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is known to play a crucial role in this process. It helps in the hydrolysis of phosphate esters, releasing phosphate ions that can combine with calcium to form calcium phosphate, a major component of bone. Pyrophosphatase is another enzyme that plays a role in calcification. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate, a process that also results in the release of phosphate ions. Therefore, the enzymes that play an important role in calcification are Alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase\"}"
