    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Golgi bodies, also known as the Golgi apparatus, are involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins for secretion. They are not directly involved in protein synthesis, which is the role of ribosomes. They also do not synthesize lipids, which is primarily the role of the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, the function of Golgi bodies is most accurately described as the sorting of glycoproteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
