    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Beta-1,3-D Glucan testing is a blood test that can detect a variety of fungal infections. It works by detecting a component of the cell wall of certain fungi. Aspergillosis, Candidiasis, and Pneumocystis are all caused by fungi that contain Beta-1,3-D Glucan in their cell walls, so the test can be used for these infections. However, Mucormycosis is caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes, which do not contain Beta-1,3-D Glucan in their cell walls. Therefore, the test would not be effective for detecting this infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mucormycosis\"}"
