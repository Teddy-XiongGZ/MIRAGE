    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Corticosteroids are used in the treatment of asthma because they have anti-inflammatory properties. They do not directly cause bronchodilation, increase bronchial responsiveness to salbutamol, or increase the action of aminophylline on adenosine receptors. However, they can indirectly improve bronchodilation by reducing inflammation and swelling in the airways, which can make it easier for other medications like salbutamol to work. They also do not increase mucociliary clearance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
