    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the temperature of the soldering torch increases during cobalt chromium crown reconstruction, it will affect the properties of the metal. The yield strength of a metal is the amount of stress that can be applied to it before it begins to deform permanently. This would decrease with increased temperature as the metal becomes more malleable. The percent elongation, which is a measure of how much a material can be stretched before it breaks, would increase as the metal becomes more ductile with increased temperature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
