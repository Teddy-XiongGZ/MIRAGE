    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that primarily affects the bone marrow. It often leads to bone lesions and can cause 'punched-out' lesions visible on radiographs. To confirm the diagnosis, a radiograph that provides a comprehensive view of the skull is needed, as the skull is a common site for these lesions. A lateral skull radiograph (A) would provide a side view, but it might not capture all potential lesions. A lateral oblique view (C) is typically used for mandibular imaging and might not cover the entire skull. A posterior anterior view (D) would provide a back-to-front view, but it might also miss some lesions. An anterior posterior view (B), however, would provide a front-to-back view of the skull, potentially capturing any lesions present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
