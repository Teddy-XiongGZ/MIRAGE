    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandible is the lower jawbone in humans. It is a unique bone because it is the only movable bone of the skull. The mandible is initially formed from cartilage, which is later replaced by bone in a process called ossification. The condylar process of the mandible is the part that articulates with the skull to form the temporomandibular joint, and it is known to ossify in cartilage. The coronoid process and the upper half of the ramus above the level of the mandibular foramen, on the other hand, do not ossify in cartilage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Condylar process\"}"
