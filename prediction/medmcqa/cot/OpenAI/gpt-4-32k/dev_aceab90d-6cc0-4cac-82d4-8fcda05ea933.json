    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child had a fractured maxillary central incisor 10 months ago and the pulp shows no response, which indicates pulp necrosis. However, there is no periapical lesion in the radiograph, which means there is no infection or abscess at the root of the tooth. Pulp capping and pulpotomy are treatments for vital pulp, not necrotic pulp. Apexification is a method to induce a calcified barrier in a root with an open apex or the continued apical development of an incomplete root in teeth with necrotic pulp. However, in this case, the tooth is a maxillary central incisor, which usually completes root development at around 3 years of age, so it's unlikely that the tooth has an open apex. Therefore, the best treatment option would be a conventional root canal treatment, which is used to treat teeth with necrotic pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
