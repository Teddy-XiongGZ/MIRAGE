    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true positives (those with the disease who test positive) divided by the total number of individuals who test positive (both true positives and false positives). Therefore, the denominator for the calculation of PPV is the sum of true positives and false positives.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. True+ves + False+ves\"}"
