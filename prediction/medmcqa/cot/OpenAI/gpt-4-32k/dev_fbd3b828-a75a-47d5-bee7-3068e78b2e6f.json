    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insulin is typically injected into areas of the body that have a layer of fat beneath the skin, such as the abdomen, the upper arm, the thigh, and the buttocks. Among these, the abdomen is the most common site for insulin injection due to its convenience and the fast absorption of insulin. The thigh is also a common site, but insulin absorption can be slower from this site, especially if the person is exercising. The arm is less commonly used because it can be difficult for people to inject themselves in this area. However, the dorsum of the arm, which is the back part of the arm, is even less commonly used due to the lack of subcutaneous fat and the potential for discomfort.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Dorsum of arm\"}"
