    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cell-mediated immune reactions, also known as delayed hypersensitivity, are primarily driven by T cells, a type of white blood cell. These reactions occur when the immune system recognizes and responds to antigens, which are substances that the body identifies as foreign. In the context of periodontitis, these antigens would likely come from the bacterial plaque that contributes to the disease. Therefore, the presence of T lymphocytes sensitized to bacterial plaque antigens would suggest that cell-mediated immune reactions are occurring.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
