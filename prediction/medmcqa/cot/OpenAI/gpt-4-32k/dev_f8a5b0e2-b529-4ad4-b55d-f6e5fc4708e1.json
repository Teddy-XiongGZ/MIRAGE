    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to understand the definitions of the terms. Prevalence is the proportion of a population who have a specific characteristic (in this case, a disease). Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease. Specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. Now, let's calculate. Out of 10,000 people, 20% have the disease, so 2000 people have the disease and 8000 do not. The test will correctly identify 95% of the 2000 people with the disease, so it will correctly identify 1900 people with the disease. It will incorrectly identify 20% of the 8000 people without the disease as having the disease, so it will incorrectly identify 1600 people as having the disease. So, out of the 3500 people the test identifies as having the disease (1900 true positives + 1600 false positives), 1900 truly have the disease. So, the PPV is 1900/3500 = 54.3%\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
