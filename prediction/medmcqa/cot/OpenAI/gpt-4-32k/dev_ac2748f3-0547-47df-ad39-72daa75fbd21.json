    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An autoclave uses pressurized steam to sterilize equipment, while a dry heat oven uses high temperatures without pressure. The main disadvantage of a dry heat oven compared to an autoclave is that it takes a longer time to achieve sterilization due to the slower rate of heat penetration and microbial killing in a dry environment. It is not less effective if used correctly, and it does not cause instruments to rust or become dull as it does not involve moisture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Time-consuming\"}"
