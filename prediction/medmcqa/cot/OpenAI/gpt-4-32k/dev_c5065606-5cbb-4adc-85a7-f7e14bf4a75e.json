    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cell membrane is a dynamic structure that can repair itself when damaged. This repair process is not simply due to the lateral movement of proteins or hydrophobic interactions, although these processes are involved in maintaining the fluidity and integrity of the membrane. Enzymes may be involved in the repair process, but they are not the primary mechanism. The repair of the cell membrane is an active process that requires energy, which is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP. Therefore, the repair of a damaged cell membrane is an active process involving the hydrolysis of ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
