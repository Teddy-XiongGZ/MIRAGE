    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental amalgams are a mixture of metals, consisting of liquid mercury and a powdered alloy composed of silver, tin, and copper. High copper dental amalgams are considered superior due to their improved physical properties. They are not known for being workable at lower mercury-alloy ratios, nor do they have a higher ratio of tensile to compressive strength. They also do not have less resistance to tarnish and corrosion. However, they are known for having less marginal breakdown, which means they are less likely to fracture or wear away at the edges, making them more durable and long-lasting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
