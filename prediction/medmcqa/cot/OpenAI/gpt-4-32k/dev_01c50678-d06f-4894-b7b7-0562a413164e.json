    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Composite restorations are made up of a matrix and filler particles. The matrix is typically a softer material, while the filler particles are harder. When polishing a composite, the softer matrix can be worn away more quickly than the harder filler particles, leading to an uneven surface. Therefore, the problem with polishing composites comes from the difference in hardness between the matrix and the filler particles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
