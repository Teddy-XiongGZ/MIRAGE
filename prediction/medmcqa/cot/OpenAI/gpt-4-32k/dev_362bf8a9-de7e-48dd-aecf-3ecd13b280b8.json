    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Orthodontic forces can be classified based on their duration and pattern of application. A continuous force is one that is applied constantly without any breaks. An interrupted force is one that is stopped and then reapplied. An intermittent force is one that is applied and then removed, with periods of no force in between. A differential force is not related to the duration of force application. In this case, the force declines to zero between activations, which means there are periods of no force. This is characteristic of an intermittent force.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Intermittent force\"}"
