    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxilla is a bone of the face, specifically the upper jaw bone. Its growth in the vertical direction can be attributed to several factors. However, the growth of the alveolus, which is the socket for the teeth, contributes significantly to the vertical growth of the maxilla.

The cranial base and synchondrosis are not directly related to the vertical growth of the maxilla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Growth of the alveolus\"}"
