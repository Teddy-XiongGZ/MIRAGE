    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CG islands, also known as CpG islands, are regions in the DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide. These regions are important for gene regulation, as they are often located near the transcription start sites of genes. Methylation of these CpG sites is a common epigenetic signaling tool that cells use to lock genes in the 'off' position. On the other hand, acetylation is associated with histones, not directly with DNA. t-RNA synthesis and DNA replication are not specifically related to CG islands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
