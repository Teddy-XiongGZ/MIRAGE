    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inferior thyroid artery is one of the main arteries that supply blood to the thyroid gland. It does not branch from the internal thoracic artery, which primarily supplies the anterior chest wall and the breasts. The dorsal scapular artery, on the other hand, supplies the levator scapulae, rhomboids, and trapezius muscles, so it's not the source of the inferior thyroid artery. The costocervical trunk is the second branch of the subclavian artery, and it primarily supplies areas in the neck and upper back, not the thyroid. The thyrocervical trunk, however, is a branch of the subclavian artery that gives rise to several arteries, including the inferior thyroid artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Thyrocervical trunk\"}"
