    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Occlusion refers to the alignment of teeth and the way that the upper and lower teeth fit together (bite). The top surface of the lower teeth should fit perfectly with the bottom surface of the upper teeth. This is not an edge-to-edge contact, nor a surface-to-surface contact. Marginal contact is not a term used in dentistry to describe occlusion. The term cusp-to-cusp contact is used to describe the way the pointed parts of the molars and premolars (cusps) fit into the grooves and depressions of the opposing teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cusp-to-cusp contact\"}"
