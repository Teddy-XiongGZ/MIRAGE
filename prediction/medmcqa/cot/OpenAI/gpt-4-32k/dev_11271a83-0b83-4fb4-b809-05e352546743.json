    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Systematic random sampling and simple random sampling are methods that do not take into account any potential factors that might affect the results. Cluster sampling is a method where the researcher divides the population into separate groups, called clusters. However, it doesn't necessarily consider potential factors that will affect the results. Stratified random sampling, on the other hand, is a method where the researcher divides the population into separate groups, or strata, based on certain characteristics. This method is used when the researcher wants to ensure that the sample represents certain characteristics in the population, which are the potential factors that will affect the results.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
