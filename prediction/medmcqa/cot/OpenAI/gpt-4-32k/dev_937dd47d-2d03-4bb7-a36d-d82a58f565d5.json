    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anorexia nervosa is a psychological disorder where the patient has a fear of gaining weight and thus, avoids eating. Even though the patient is on a recommended diet plan, there is no weight gain which could be due to purging behaviors or not eating the food provided. Increasing fluid intake or caloric intake might not be helpful if the patient is not consuming the food. Increasing the dose of anxiolytics might help with anxiety but it doesn't directly address the issue of weight gain. Observing the patient for 2 hours after meal can help to ensure that the patient is not engaging in purging behaviors and is actually consuming the food.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Observe patient for 2 hours after meal\"}"
