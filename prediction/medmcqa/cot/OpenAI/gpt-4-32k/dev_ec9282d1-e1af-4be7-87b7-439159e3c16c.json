    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulpal injury progression refers to the progression of damage to the dental pulp, the part of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels. Pain during this progression is primarily due to the response of the nerve fibers within the pulp. When the pulp is injured, the nerve fibers' threshold to pain decreases, meaning they become more sensitive and thus more likely to transmit pain signals. The other options, such as increased vascular permeability, arteriolar dilatation, and decreased pressure, can contribute to the overall inflammatory response, but they are not the main cause of the pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
