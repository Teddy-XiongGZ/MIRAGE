    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Couinaud classification of liver anatomy divides the liver into eight functionally independent liver segments. Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow, and biliary drainage. In the center of each segment are branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct. Therefore, the structure that differentiates the segments anatomically is the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct. However, among the given options, only the hepatic vein and bile duct are part of this structure. The hepatic vein is more related to the outflow, while the bile duct is directly involved in the drainage system of each segment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bile duct\"}"
