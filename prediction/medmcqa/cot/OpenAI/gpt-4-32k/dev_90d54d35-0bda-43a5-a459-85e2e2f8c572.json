    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for a term that describes a specific dental condition where the root of a tooth is exposed, but still covered by periosteum and gingiva. Fenestration refers to a window-like opening in the bone covering the root of a tooth, but it doesn't necessarily mean the bone is completely denuded. Infracrestal pocket and Hemiseptum defect are not terms that describe this condition. Dehiscence, however, refers to the loss of alveolar bone from the cementoenamel junction to the alveolar crest, which leaves the root covered only by periosteum and overlying gingiva.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Dehiscence\"}"
