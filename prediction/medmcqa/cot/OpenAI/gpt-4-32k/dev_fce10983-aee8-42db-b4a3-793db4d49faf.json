    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In radiography, the target to object distance is the distance between the x-ray tube (target) and the object being imaged. To maintain parallelism and avoid distortion, the target to object distance should be increased. This is because increasing the distance allows the x-rays to be more parallel when they hit the object, reducing distortion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
