    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Caries in a 4 year old child can be assessed by several factors. Previous caries experience (A) can be a good indicator, but it's not the best as the child is only 4 years old and may not have had enough time to develop a significant caries history. Maternal caries (B) can be a risk factor for the child, but it's not a direct assessment of the child's caries. School fluoridation (C) is not relevant as the child is too young to go to school. Daily fluoride mouthwash (D) can be a preventive measure, but it's not an assessment method.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Maternal caries\"}"
