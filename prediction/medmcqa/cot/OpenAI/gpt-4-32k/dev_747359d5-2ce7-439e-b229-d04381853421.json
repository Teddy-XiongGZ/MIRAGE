    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The normal range for blood pH is 7.35 to 7.45. A pH less than 7.35 is considered acidic and indicates acidosis. The normal range for pCO2 is 35 to 45 mm Hg. A pCO2 of 35 mm Hg is within the normal range, which means the respiratory system is not likely the cause of the acidosis. Therefore, the acidosis is likely metabolic in nature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metabolic acidosis\"}"
