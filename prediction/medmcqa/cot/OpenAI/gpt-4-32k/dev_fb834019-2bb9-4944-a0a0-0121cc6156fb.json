    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance because it tells the investigator that the hypothesis under consideration may not adequately explain the observation. In most cases, a p-value of 0.05 (5%) is accepted to mean the data is valid. In the context of a statistical test, if the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (Ho), which is the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between specified populations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
