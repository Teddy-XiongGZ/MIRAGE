    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporal bone is a complex structure that houses many important anatomical features, including the middle and inner ear. An X-ray would not provide enough detail to accurately assess a lesion in this area. USG, or ultrasound, is also not typically used for bone imaging due to its inability to penetrate bone. Between CT and MRI, CT is often the preferred method for imaging the temporal bone because it provides detailed images of the bone structure, which is crucial for diagnosing and treating lesions in this area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
