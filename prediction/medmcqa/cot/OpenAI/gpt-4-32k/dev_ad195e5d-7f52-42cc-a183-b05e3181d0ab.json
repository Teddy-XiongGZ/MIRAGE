    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, history, and echocardiogram findings suggest a pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. This can be caused by deep vein thrombosis, which can be a complication of nephrotic syndrome and can be exacerbated by prolonged air travel. The primary treatment for pulmonary embolism is anticoagulation to prevent further clot formation. Thrombectomy is a surgical procedure and is not the first line of treatment. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is used for dissolving clots, but it's usually reserved for life-threatening situations. An IVC filter is used when anticoagulation is contraindicated. Therefore, the best choice is unfractionated heparin, which is an anticoagulant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Unfractionated heparin\"}"
