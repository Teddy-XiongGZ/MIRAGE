    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"T-lymphocytes, also known as T cells, are a type of white blood cell that play a central role in cell-mediated immunity. They do not produce antibodies, that's the role of B-lymphocytes, so option A is incorrect. The complement system is a part of the immune system that enhances the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, but it's not directly activated by T-lymphocytes, so option C is incorrect. Immediate hypersensitivity is an allergic reaction provoked by re-exposure to a specific type of antigen referred to as an allergen, which is typically mediated by IgE antibodies, not T-lymphocytes, so option D is incorrect. T-lymphocytes are involved in the production of lymphokines, which are a type of cytokine produced by a type of lymphocyte. They also play a role in delayed hypersensitivity, which is a type of cell-mediated immune response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
