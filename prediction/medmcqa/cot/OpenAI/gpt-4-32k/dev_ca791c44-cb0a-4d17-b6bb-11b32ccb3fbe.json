    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Compression osteosynthesis is a surgical procedure that is used to fix a bone fracture. It works by applying pressure to the fracture site to promote bone healing. It was not initially used for malunion or non-union, as these are complications that may occur after a fracture has not healed properly.
