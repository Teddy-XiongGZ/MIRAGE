    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandible, or lower jaw, can perform several movements including protrusion, retrusion, elevation, and depression. The muscles involved in these movements are the lateral pterygoid, medial pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis. The lateral pterygoid is primarily responsible for protrusion and lateral movement of the mandible. The medial pterygoid and masseter are mainly involved in elevation of the mandible. The temporalis muscle, on the other hand, is responsible for elevation and retrusion (pulling back) of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Temporalis\"}"
