    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An obligate intracellular parasite is an organism that can only reproduce by invading and taking over other cells as it lacks the necessary metabolic machinery. Tropheryma whippelii and Bartonella henselae are facultative intracellular parasites, meaning they can survive and reproduce either inside or outside cells. Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular parasite, but so is Coxiella burnetii. However, Coxiella burnetii is unique among the obligate intracellular bacteria because it can survive in a spore-like form outside of host cells, which is not typical for an obligate intracellular parasite. Therefore, the best answer is Ehrlichia chaffeensis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
