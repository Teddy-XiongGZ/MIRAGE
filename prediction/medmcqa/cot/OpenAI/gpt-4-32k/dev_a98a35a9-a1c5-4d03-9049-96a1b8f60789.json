    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The odontoblastic layer is a layer of cells in the pulp of the tooth that produces dentin. The size of these cells does not directly depend on the number of dentinal tubules, so option A is incorrect. The odontoblasts are typically described as having a columnar shape, but this is not specific to the crown of the tooth, so option B is incorrect. The odontoblasts are not squamous in the apical portion, so option C is also incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
