    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder that can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding. The bleeding results from unusually low levels of platelets \u2014 the cells that help blood clot. Statement A is true because ITP is often associated with platelet-specific auto-antibodies. Statement B is also true because the low platelet count can lead to prolonged bleeding time. Statement C is true because ITP is often controllable by immunosuppressive treatment. However, statement D is not true. Hemophilia is a rare disorder in which your blood doesn't clot normally because it lacks sufficient blood-clotting proteins (clotting factors). Hemophilia can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery which is more severe than ITP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
