    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tooth formation, also known as odontogenesis, is a complex process that occurs in several stages. These stages include the bud stage, cap stage, bell stage, and finally the apposition and maturation stage. The size and shape of the tooth are determined during the morphodifferentiation stage, which is part of the bell stage. This is when the dental organ takes on a shape that closely resembles the final tooth shape. Therefore, the size of the tooth is determined during the morphodifferentiation stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Morpho differentiation\"}"
