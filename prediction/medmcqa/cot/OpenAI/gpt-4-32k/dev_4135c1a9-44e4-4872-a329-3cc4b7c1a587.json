    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement are both types of dental cements. Zinc eugenol cement does not have polyacrylic acid as a liquid, so option A is incorrect. It also does not have a chemical bond to tooth structure, so option B is incorrect. Substitution of eugenol by EBA to increase strength of cement is specific to zinc eugenol cement, so option D is incorrect. Chelation, which is a type of bonding that occurs between a metal ion and a ligand, is common to both zinc eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
