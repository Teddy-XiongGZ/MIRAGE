    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiographs, also known as X-rays, are a valuable tool in diagnosing various dental conditions. Cementoma, subluxation teeth, and impacted canines can all be identified through radiographs. Cementoma is a type of benign tumor of the teeth, which can be seen as a radiopaque mass on radiographs. Subluxation teeth refer to teeth that have been dislocated from their normal position, which can also be identified on radiographs. Impacted canines are teeth that have not erupted properly, and their position can be determined using radiographs. However, an acute alveolar abscess, which is a localized collection of pus in the alveolar bone at the root of a tooth, may not be visible on radiographs, especially in the early stages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
