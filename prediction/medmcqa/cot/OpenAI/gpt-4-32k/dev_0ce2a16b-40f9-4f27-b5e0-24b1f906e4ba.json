    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Employees' State Insurance (ESI) Act is a self-financing social security and health insurance scheme for Indian workers. The act also provides funeral expenses, but the amount is not specified as Rs 50,000, so option A is incorrect. The contribution of the state government and the ESI corporation towards medical care is not divided into 1/8 and 7/8 respectively, so option B is incorrect. The contribution towards ESI is not a fixed amount but a percentage of the employee's wages, so option C is incorrect. The ESI Act stipulates that the employee's contribution rate is 1.75% of the wages and the employer's contribution rate is 4.75% of the wages, so option D is also incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
