    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The steady state plasma concentration (Css) of a drug can be calculated using the formula: Css = Rate of infusion / Clearance. Here, the rate of infusion is 1.6 mg/min and the clearance is 640 mL/min. Substituting these values into the formula gives: Css = 1.6 mg/min / 640 mL/min = 0.0025 mg/mL. However, this value is not among the options. It seems there might be a rounding error in the options. The closest value to 0.0025 mg/mL is 0.002 mg/mL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
