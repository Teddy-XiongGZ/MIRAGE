    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Postauricular lymphadenopathy refers to the enlargement of the lymph nodes located behind the ears. This condition in children is most commonly caused by an infection or inflammation in the head or neck area. Let's consider the options: A. Sore throat - This could potentially cause lymphadenopathy, but it would more likely affect the anterior cervical lymph nodes, not the postauricular ones. B. Pediculosis capitis - This is a head lice infestation, which could potentially cause lymphadenopathy due to the body's immune response, but it's not the most common cause. C. Pulmonary Koch's - This is a type of tuberculosis, which could cause generalized lymphadenopathy, but it's not common in children and wouldn't specifically target the postauricular lymph nodes. D. Chronic suppurative otitis media - This is a chronic ear infection, which could definitely cause postauricular lymphadenopathy due to the close proximity of the infection to these lymph nodes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
