    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intracerebral pressure can be decreased by various methods. Limiting pCO2 can cause cerebral vasoconstriction and thus decrease intracranial pressure, but it's not the best strategy. Administering sedatives can decrease metabolic demand and thus decrease intracranial pressure, but it's also not the best strategy. Oxygen supplementation by mechanical ventilation can help maintain adequate oxygenation and decrease intracranial pressure. Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to prevent cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage, not specifically for decreasing intracranial pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
