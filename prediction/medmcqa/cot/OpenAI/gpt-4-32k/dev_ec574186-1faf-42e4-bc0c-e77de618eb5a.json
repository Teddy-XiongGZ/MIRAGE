    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malocclusion refers to the misalignment of teeth, which is a condition, not an event. Therefore, we are not looking at the number of new cases over a certain period of time, which would be incidence rate. Morbidity refers to the state of being diseased, which is not specific enough for this context. Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur, which is not applicable here. Prevalence rate, on the other hand, refers to the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a specific time. Therefore, the occurrence of malocclusion in a given population is best described as the prevalence rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
