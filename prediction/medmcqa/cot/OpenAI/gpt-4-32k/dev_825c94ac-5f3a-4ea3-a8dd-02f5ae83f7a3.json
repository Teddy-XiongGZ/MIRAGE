    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cryosurgery is a type of surgery that involves the use of extreme cold to destroy abnormal tissues, such as tumors. The surgery most often involves the use of liquid nitrogen, although carbon dioxide and argon may also be used. When these substances are applied to the body, they can destroy cells by crystallizing the cytosol, which is the liquid found inside cells, and this can lead to cell death. This process typically occurs when the temperature falls below -20\u00b0C. Cells do not get evaporated, they die due to the freezing process. Also, cryosurgery does not always require general anesthesia; it depends on the location and size of the abnormal tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
