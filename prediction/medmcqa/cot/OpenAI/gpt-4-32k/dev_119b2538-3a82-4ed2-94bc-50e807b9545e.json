    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity refers to the ability of a material to resist deformation under stress. In the context of dental restorations, the cement used should ideally have a modulus of elasticity that is similar to that of the tooth structure to ensure optimal stress distribution. Zinc phosphate cement (ZnPO4) is known for its high compressive strength and modulus of elasticity, making it suitable for use under complex amalgam restorations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. ZnPO4\"}"
