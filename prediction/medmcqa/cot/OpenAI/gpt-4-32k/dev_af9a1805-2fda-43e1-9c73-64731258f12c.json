    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the blood pressure value above which 95% of the population would fall. This is essentially asking for the 5th percentile of the distribution. Given that the mean is 125 mm Hg and the standard deviation is 10 mm Hg, we can use the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule) which states that approximately 95% of values in a normal distribution fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, the 5th percentile would be 2 standard deviations below the mean. So, 125 - 2*10 = 105 mm Hg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 105 mm Hg\"}"
