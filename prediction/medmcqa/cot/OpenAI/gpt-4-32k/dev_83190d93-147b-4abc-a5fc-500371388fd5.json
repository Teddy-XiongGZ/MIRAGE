    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Respiratory insufficiency is a condition in which the respiratory system fails in one or both of its gas exchange functions: oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination. Hypoxia, which is a lack of sufficient oxygen in the body or a region of the body, is a sign of respiratory insufficiency. Stridor during inspiration, which is a high-pitched, wheezing sound caused by disrupted airflow, is also a sign of respiratory insufficiency. However, the inability to speak is not a direct sign of respiratory insufficiency. It could be caused by other conditions such as neurological disorders, throat infections, or vocal cord damage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
