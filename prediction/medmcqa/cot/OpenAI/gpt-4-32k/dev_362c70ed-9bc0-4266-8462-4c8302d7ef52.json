    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Granular dystrophy of the cornea is a type of eye disorder that is characterized by the deposition of abnormal protein material in the cornea. The protein material can be stained using specific types of stains to aid in diagnosis. Congo red stain is typically used for amyloid deposits, not granular dystrophy. Masson trichrome is used for staining connective tissue, not granular dystrophy. Colloidal iron is used for staining mucopolysaccharides, not granular dystrophy. PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) stain, on the other hand, is used to stain glycogen and other polysaccharides, which are the types of proteins that accumulate in granular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. PAS\"}"
