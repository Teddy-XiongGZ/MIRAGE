    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of proptosis (bulging of the eye) and pain in the right eye, along with the recent history of trauma, suggest a condition related to the eye or surrounding structures. A fracture of the sphenoid bone could potentially cause these symptoms, but it would likely also present with other neurological symptoms. Cavernous sinus thrombosis could also cause proptosis and pain, but it is usually associated with other symptoms such as fever, headache, and seizures. An internal carotid artery aneurysm could potentially cause these symptoms, but it is less likely in a young adult and usually presents with other symptoms such as a pulsating mass. A carotico-cavernous fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, can occur after trauma and would likely cause the presented symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Carotico-cavernous fistula\"}"
