    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endodontically treated teeth are more susceptible to fracture due to several reasons. First, the loss of moisture can make the tooth more brittle and prone to fracture. Second, the hollowing out of the canals during the endodontic treatment can weaken the tooth structure. Lastly, the loss of coronal structure, which often occurs during the treatment, can also contribute to the increased risk of fracture. Therefore, all of these factors can make endodontically treated teeth more susceptible to fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of the above.\"}"
