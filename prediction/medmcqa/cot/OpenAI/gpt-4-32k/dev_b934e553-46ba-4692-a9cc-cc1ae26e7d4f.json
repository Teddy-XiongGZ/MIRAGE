    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total amount of drug in the solution. We have 2 ampules, each containing 200 mg, so that's 400 mg in total. Then, we need to calculate the dose per minute for the patient. The dose is 10 mcg/kg/min, and the patient weighs 80 kg, so the dose is 800 mcg/min. Since 1 mg = 1000 mcg, the dose is 0.8 mg/min. Now, we need to calculate how many minutes the solution will last. We have 400 mg of drug, and we're giving 0.8 mg/min, so the solution will last 500 minutes. Since the solution is 250 mL, and 16 drops = 1 mL, the solution is 4000 drops. If the solution needs to last 500 minutes, we need to give 4000 drops / 500 minutes = 8 drops/min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
