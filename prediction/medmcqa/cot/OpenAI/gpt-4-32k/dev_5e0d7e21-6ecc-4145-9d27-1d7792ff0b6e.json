    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Partial veneer crowns are a type of dental restoration that covers only a portion of a tooth. They are typically used when the tooth is still relatively healthy and only a portion of it needs to be restored. Long teeth (A) would not be a contraindication as they provide enough surface area for the crown to adhere. Tipped teeth (C) can also be corrected with partial veneer crowns. Tapered teeth (D) can be a challenge but not necessarily a contraindication. However, short teeth (B) may not provide enough surface area for the crown to adhere properly, making it a contraindication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
