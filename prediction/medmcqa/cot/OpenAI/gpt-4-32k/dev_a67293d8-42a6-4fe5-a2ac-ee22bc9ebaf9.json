    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acid dissolution is a process that occurs when an acid comes into contact with a substance and dissolves it. In the context of a rod, this would most likely occur in the area that is most exposed to the acid.

Therefore, it would be the most likely area to experience acid dissolution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Head region\"}"
