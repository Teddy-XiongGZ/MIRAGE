    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bullet fingerprinting refers to the unique markings left on a bullet when it is fired from a gun. These markings are caused by the interaction of the bullet with the gun's barrel. This does not refer to human fingerprints on a bullet, nor does it refer to a distorted bullet. The terms 'primary marking' and 'secondary marking' are not specific enough, as they could refer to any type of marking, not necessarily those on a bullet.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
