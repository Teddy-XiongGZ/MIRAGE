    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over the one below it. It is most commonly diagnosed using imaging techniques. CT and MR are both very useful in diagnosing this condition as they provide detailed images of the spine. X-ray lumbar spine- AP view and X-ray lumbar spine- Lateral view are also used, but they provide less detailed images compared to CT and MR. However, between the two X-ray views, the AP view is less useful because it is a front-to-back view, while the lateral view is a side view which is more helpful in diagnosing Spondylolisthesis as it can show the forward slippage of the vertebra.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
