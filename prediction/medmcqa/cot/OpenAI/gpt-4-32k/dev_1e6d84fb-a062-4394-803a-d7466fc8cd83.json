    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question is asking about the percentage of phosphoric acid where dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed that cannot be rinsed off. This is a specific chemical reaction that occurs under certain conditions. The percentage of phosphoric acid where dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed that cannot be rinsed off is typically around 37%. This is because at this concentration, the phosphoric acid reacts with the calcium in the tooth to form a layer of dicalcium phosphate monohydrate that is resistant to rinsing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
