    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Type I hypersensitivity is also known as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. This is because it occurs immediately after exposure to an antigen. The reaction involves the antigen binding to antibodies (IgE) that are already attached to the surface of mast cells and basophils. This binding triggers the release of various substances, including histamine, which cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. The other types of hypersensitivity reactions (Type II, III, and IV) involve different mechanisms and do not occur immediately after antigen exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
