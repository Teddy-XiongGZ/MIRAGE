    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gait apraxia is a disorder of motor planning which is not due to motor weakness, sensory loss, or coordination problems. It is often seen in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus, Alzheimer's disease, and other conditions that affect the frontal lobes. The Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) supplies the medial part of the frontal lobes, which includes the supplementary motor area, an area involved in complex motor planning. Therefore, a thromboembolic episode involving the ACA could potentially lead to gait apraxia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. ACA\"}"
