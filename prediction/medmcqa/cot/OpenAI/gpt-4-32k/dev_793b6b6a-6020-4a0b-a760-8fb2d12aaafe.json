    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Supragingival plaque is a biofilm that forms on the teeth. Over time, the composition of the plaque changes. Initially, it is colonized by gram-positive bacteria. However, as the plaque matures, it becomes more anaerobic and the microflora shifts towards gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the plaque does not decrease in mass, nor does it become more gram positive. Spirochetes are a type of gram-negative bacteria, but they are not the predominant type in supragingival plaque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
