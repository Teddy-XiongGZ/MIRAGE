    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical gingival sulcus is the space between the tooth and the surrounding gingival tissue. The depth of the sulcus is measured from the gingival margin to the base of the sulcus. The base of the sulcus is where the junctional epithelium is located, which is the tissue that attaches the gingiva to the tooth. Therefore, the depth of the clinical gingival sulcus is the distance from the gingival margin to the apical extension of the junctional epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Apical extension of junctional epithelium\"}"
