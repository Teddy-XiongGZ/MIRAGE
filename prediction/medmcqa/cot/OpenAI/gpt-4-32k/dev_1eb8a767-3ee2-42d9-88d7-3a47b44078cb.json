    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular nerve is the third branch of the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. The mandibular nerve block is a common procedure used in dentistry for numbing the lower jaw before procedures. The facial nerve is not typically affected by a mandibular nerve block as it is a separate cranial nerve that controls muscles of facial expression. The abducens and trochlear nerves are also separate cranial nerves that control eye movement, so they would not typically be affected by a mandibular nerve block. The vagus nerve is a cranial nerve that sends information to and from the brain to regulate the functions of various body systems, including the heart, lungs, and digestive tract. It is not typically affected by a mandibular nerve block. Therefore, none of the options provided are typically damaged during a mandibular nerve block.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
