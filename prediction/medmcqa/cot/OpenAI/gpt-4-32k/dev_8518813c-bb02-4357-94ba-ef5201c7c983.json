    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's cancer is at stage T3N2M0. This means the tumor is larger (T3), it has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N2), but there is no distant metastasis (M0). Surgery is usually the first line of treatment for oral cancer. However, given the size of the tumor and the involvement of lymph nodes, additional treatment is likely necessary to ensure all cancer cells are eradicated. Radiotherapy is often used in conjunction with surgery in these cases, as it can kill any remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy alone is not typically the first choice for oral cancer, especially when the cancer is locally advanced but has not metastasized. Therefore, the combination of surgery and radiotherapy seems to be the most appropriate treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Surgery + radiotherapy\"}"
