    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polycystic ovarian disease, also known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs. In PCOS, there is a persistently elevated level of luteinizing hormone (LH) and an increased LH/FSH ratio. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is also typically elevated in PCOS, as it is an androgen. However, prolactin levels are not typically elevated in PCOS. Increased prolactin levels, or hyperprolactinemia, can cause symptoms such as irregular menstrual periods and infertility, but it is not a characteristic of PCOS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
