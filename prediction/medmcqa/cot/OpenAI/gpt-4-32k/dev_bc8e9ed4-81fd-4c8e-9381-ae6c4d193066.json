    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Choriocarcinoma is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease that can occur after a hydatidiform mole. Rising hCG levels are a sign of this conversion, as the tumor cells produce this hormone. Theca lutein cysts are also associated with this condition, as they are caused by high levels of hCG. An increase in uterus size can also indicate the presence of a tumor. However, a sub urethral nodule is not associated with choriocarcinoma. This is typically a sign of a different condition, such as a urethral diverticulum or Skene's duct cyst.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
