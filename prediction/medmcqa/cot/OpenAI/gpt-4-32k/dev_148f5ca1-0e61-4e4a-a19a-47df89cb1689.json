    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to a part of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common cause is the occlusion (blockage) of a coronary artery following the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which is an unstable collection of lipids and white blood cells in the wall of an artery. The resulting ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and ensuing oxygen shortage, if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can cause damage or death (necrosis) of heart muscle tissue (myocardium).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Myocardial necrosis caused by acute occlusion of a coronary artery.\"}"
