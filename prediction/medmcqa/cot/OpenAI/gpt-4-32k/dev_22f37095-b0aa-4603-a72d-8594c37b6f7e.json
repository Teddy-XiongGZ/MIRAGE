    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute inflammation is a response to cell injury, and it involves the movement of plasma and leukocytes from the blood into the injured tissues. Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently upon infection with intracellular pathogens. Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is associated with inflammation. Necrosis is the death of most or all of the cells in an organ or tissue due to disease, injury, or failure of the blood supply. Among these, Pyroptosis is the one that is highly associated with inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
