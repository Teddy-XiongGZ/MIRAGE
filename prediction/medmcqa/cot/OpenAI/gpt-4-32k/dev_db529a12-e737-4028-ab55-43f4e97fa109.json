    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactose intolerance is caused by the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. All the options given contain lactose, but the amount varies. Condensed milk and skimmed milk are both milk products and contain a high amount of lactose. Ice cream also contains lactose as it is made from milk. Yogurt, on the other hand, contains bacteria that break down lactose, making it easier to digest for people with lactose intolerance. Therefore, yogurt is the least likely to cause lactose intolerance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
