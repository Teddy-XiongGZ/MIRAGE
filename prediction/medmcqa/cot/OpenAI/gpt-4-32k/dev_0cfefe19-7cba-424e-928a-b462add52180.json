    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acid etching is a technique used in dentistry to prepare the tooth surface for bonding. It involves applying an acid solution to the tooth surface to roughen it up and create microscopic pores. This increases the surface area for the bonding material to adhere to, which can help to decrease micro leakage. It does not directly affect polymerization shrinkage, coefficient of thermal expansion, or porosity in restorative material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
