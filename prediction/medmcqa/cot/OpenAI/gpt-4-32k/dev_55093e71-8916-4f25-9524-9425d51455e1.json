    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also known as hyaline membrane disease, is a common cause of respiratory distress in preterm infants. It is caused by surfactant deficiency, leading to alveolar collapse. Factors that favor RDS include prematurity, maternal diabetes, and cesarean delivery without labor. Antenatal corticosteroids (choice A) are given to mothers at risk of preterm delivery to accelerate fetal lung maturity and decrease the incidence of RDS, so this would not favor RDS. The onset of distress after 6 hours of birth (choice C) and term birth (choice D) are also not typical for RDS, as it usually presents shortly after birth and is more common in preterm infants. An air bronchogram on chest x-ray (choice B), however, is a classic finding in RDS. It is caused by air-filled bronchi (which are not collapsed) being made visible by the surrounding collapsed, opaque alveoli.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
