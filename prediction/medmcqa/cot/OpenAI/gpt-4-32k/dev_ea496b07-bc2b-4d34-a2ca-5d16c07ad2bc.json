    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CSF leakage, or cerebrospinal fluid leakage, can be diagnosed through several methods. The 'Tram Line' sign is a radiological sign seen in CT scans of the sinuses, indicating a CSF leak. \u03b2 2-transferrin is a protein found almost exclusively in the CSF, and its presence in a fluid sample can indicate a CSF leak. An increase in glucose levels can also indicate a CSF leak, as CSF typically has a high glucose content. However, an increase in proteins is not a typical indicator of a CSF leak. While CSF does contain proteins, their levels do not typically increase in the event of a leak.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
