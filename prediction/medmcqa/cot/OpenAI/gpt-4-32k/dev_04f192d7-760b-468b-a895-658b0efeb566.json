    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The auditory pathway starts at the cochlear nucleus (B) after the sound has been transduced into neural signals by the cochlea. From the cochlear nucleus, the signals are sent to the superior olivary complex (not listed here), then to the inferior colliculus (A). From the inferior colliculus, the signals are sent to the medial geniculate body (D) in the thalamus. Finally, the signals are sent to the auditory cortex (C) where they are processed as sound.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B>A>D>C\"}"
