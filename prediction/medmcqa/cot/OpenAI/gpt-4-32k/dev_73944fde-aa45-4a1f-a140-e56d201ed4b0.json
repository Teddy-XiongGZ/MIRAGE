    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's go through each statement. 1. CPR can indeed be given irrespective of a rib fracture. The priority is to restore blood flow and oxygen to the brain, and while a rib fracture can complicate CPR, it should not prevent it. So, a is true. 2. The adult chest compression to breath ratio is indeed 30:2, regardless of whether a second rescuer is present. So, b is true. 3. For infants, the ratio does change from 30:2 to 15:2 when a second rescuer arrives. So, c is true. 4. The chest compression rate for both adults and infants should be between 100-120 compressions per minute. So, d is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. a, c, d are true & b is false\"}"
