    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Open reduction is a surgical procedure used to set a bone after a fracture, and it's typically used when the fracture is severe. In the context of condylar fractures, open reduction is usually indicated when there is a significant displacement or angulation that cannot be managed by closed reduction. Looking at the options, lateral displacement of the condyle (option B) and 200 angulations (option C) could potentially indicate the need for open reduction. However, the degree of angulation that necessitates open reduction can vary, and 200 degrees seems excessive and unlikely. Therefore, the most absolute indication among the given options would be when the condyle is separated from the stump (option D), as this represents a severe displacement that would likely require surgical intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
