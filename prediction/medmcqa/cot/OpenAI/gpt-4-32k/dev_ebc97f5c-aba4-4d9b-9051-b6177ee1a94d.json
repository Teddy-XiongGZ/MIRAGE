    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardiac afterload refers to the resistance that the heart must overcome to fully eject blood from the ventricles. It is primarily determined by the resistance offered by the peripheral vasculature, the compliance of the aorta, and the volume and viscosity of the blood. Mean arterial pressure and LV mean systolic pressure are not direct measures of afterload. LV end diastolic pressure is a measure of preload, not afterload. Therefore, the best index to measure cardiac afterload is total peripheral resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
