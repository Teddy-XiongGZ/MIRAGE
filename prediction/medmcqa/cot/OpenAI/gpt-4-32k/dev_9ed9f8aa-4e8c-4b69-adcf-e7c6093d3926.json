    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Health education is a process that involves imparting knowledge and skills to individuals or communities about various health-related topics. This includes appeals to reason, which involves providing logical and rational arguments to convince individuals to adopt healthy behaviors. It also includes positive instilled behavior, which involves encouraging individuals to adopt healthy habits and behaviors. Health education also encourages people to think for themselves, which involves promoting critical thinking and decision-making skills.
