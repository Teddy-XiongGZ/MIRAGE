    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, also known as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), is an enzyme that is found in various tissues, including the heart and liver. When these tissues are damaged, AST is released into the bloodstream. Renal failure primarily affects the kidneys, not the heart or liver, so it would not typically result in an increase in AST. Prostatic carcinoma is a type of cancer that affects the prostate, not the heart or liver, so it would not typically result in an increase in AST. Pulmonary edema is a condition that affects the lungs, not the heart or liver, so it would not typically result in an increase in AST. Myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, involves damage to the heart tissue, which would result in an increase in AST.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Myocardial infarction\"}"
