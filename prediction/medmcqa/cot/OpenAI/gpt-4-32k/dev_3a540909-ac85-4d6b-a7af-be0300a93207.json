    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-paralytic polio, also known as abortive poliomyelitis, presents with flu-like symptoms but does not involve the central nervous system. Therefore, it does not cause paralysis or muscle weakness. Absent deep tendon reflexes (A) and head drop (B) are signs of muscle weakness or paralysis, which are not features of non-paralytic polio. Nuchal rigidity (C) is a sign of meningitis, which can occur in non-paralytic polio. The knee heel test (D) is a neurological examination used to assess coordination, and a negative result would indicate normal function, which is consistent with non-paralytic polio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
