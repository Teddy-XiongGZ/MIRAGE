    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Centric occlusion refers to the position of the teeth when the jaws are closed and the teeth are in maximum contact. If there is prematurity in centric occlusion, it means that some teeth are contacting before others, which can lead to discomfort and other dental problems. The best way to correct this is to reduce the parts of the teeth that are making premature contact. This would not involve changing the mesiodistal position of the teeth, as this would affect the overall alignment of the teeth. The cusps of opposing teeth or the opposing fassa or marginal ridge could be the areas making premature contact, so reducing these could correct the problem.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cusps of opposing teeth\"}"
