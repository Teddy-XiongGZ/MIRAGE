    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Inheritance patterns depend on whether a disease is autosomal or sex-linked, and whether it is dominant or recessive. Autosomal dominant and recessive diseases can be passed on by both parents, so they are not the correct answer. X-linked recessive diseases can be passed on by the mother to all sons, but not to all offspring, so this is also not the correct answer. Mitochondrial inheritance is unique because mitochondria are only passed on from the mother to all offspring, so if the mother is affected, all offspring will be affected.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
