    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The size of the filler particles in a composite material can affect its properties. Larger filler particles can increase the strength of the composite because they provide more surface area for the matrix to bond to. However, they can also increase the surface roughness because the larger particles are more likely to protrude from the surface. They do not directly affect the exposure time or the viscosity of the composite.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
