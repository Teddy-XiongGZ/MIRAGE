    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Desmoid tumors are benign fibrous neoplasms originating from the musculoaponeurotic structures throughout the body. The most common presentation of abdominal desmoid tumors is an abdominal mass, as these tumors grow slowly and often do not cause symptoms until they are large enough to be felt or to press on other organs. Abdominal pain, fever, and urinary retention can occur, but these are not the most common presentations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Abdominal mass\"}"
