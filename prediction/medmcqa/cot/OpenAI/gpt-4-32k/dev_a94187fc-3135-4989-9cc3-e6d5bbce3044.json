    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the case of a mandibular fracture in a child, the primary method of assessing bone healing is through clinical examination. This includes checking for pain, mobility, and alignment of the jaw. However, imaging can also be used to confirm healing. An Orthopantomogram (OPG) is a panoramic scanning dental X-ray of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two-dimensional view of a half-circle from ear to ear. It is not necessary to perform an OPG every 2 months for a year. A Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) or a Single Contrast CT could provide more detailed images, but they expose the child to a higher level of radiation, which is not ideal. Therefore, the best option is to rely on clinical examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
