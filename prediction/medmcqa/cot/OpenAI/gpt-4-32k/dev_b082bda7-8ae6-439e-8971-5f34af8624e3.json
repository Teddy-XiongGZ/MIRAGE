    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, the body's demand for oxygen and nutrients increases, especially in the muscles that are being used. This requires an increase in blood flow to these muscles, which happens almost immediately, not after 1\u00bd minute. Therefore, option C is incorrect. The body also generates more heat during exercise due to the increased metabolic rate, which leads to an increase in body temperature. So, option B is correct. The cerebral blood flow is tightly regulated and does not significantly increase with exercise or systolic blood pressure, so option A is incorrect. Lastly, the lymphatic flow from muscles does not decrease during exercise. Instead, it may increase due to the increased demand for removal of waste products from the muscles. So, option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
