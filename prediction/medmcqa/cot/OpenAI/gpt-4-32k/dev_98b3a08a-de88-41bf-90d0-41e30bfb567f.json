    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The plane of orientation is a reference plane used in prosthodontics, particularly in the construction of dentures. It helps in establishing the occlusal plane, which is the average plane established by the incisal and occlusal surfaces of the teeth. It is not primarily used for measuring the height and length of posterior teeth, nor is it used to divide the distance between upper and lower cast equally. It can be considered an arbitrary plane when established on the articulator, but its main purpose is to guide the establishment of the occlusal plane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
