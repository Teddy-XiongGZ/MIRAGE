    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mucostatic impression materials are those that do not displace the soft tissues in the mouth when taking an impression. A thin mix of plaster of paris and zinc oxide eugenol impression paste are not mucostatic as they can displace tissues. Reversible hydrocolloids are also not mucostatic as they can exert pressure on the tissues. Free flowing wax, on the other hand, is a mucostatic material as it flows into the crevices without displacing the tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Free flowing wax\"}"
