    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sequence for CPR in infants is Airway, Breathing, and then Compressions, so statement 1 is false. The correct number of chest compressions for infants is 30, so statement 2 is true. The ratio of compressions to breaths in infant CPR is 30:2, not 15:1, so statement 3 is false. The depth of chest compressions in infants should be about 1.5 inches, so statement 4 is true. Lastly, in infants, the brachial pulse should indeed be assessed, so statement 5 is true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
