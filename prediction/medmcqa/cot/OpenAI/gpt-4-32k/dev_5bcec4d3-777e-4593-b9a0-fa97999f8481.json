Specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). If the specificity is higher, the test is less likely to give a false positive result. Therefore, if the proportion of false positive results is lower in population A, it means the specificity of the test is higher in population A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
