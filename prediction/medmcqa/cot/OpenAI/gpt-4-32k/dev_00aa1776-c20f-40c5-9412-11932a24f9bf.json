    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Strain is a term used in physics and engineering, and it refers to the deformation of a body due to an applied force. It is not the force itself, nor the external or internal forces opposing the applied load. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that refers to deformation resulting from an applied load.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
