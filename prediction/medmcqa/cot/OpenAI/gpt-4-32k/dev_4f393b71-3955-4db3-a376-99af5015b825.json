    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Azoospermia is a condition where there is no sperm in the semen. This can be due to either a problem with sperm production in the testes (testicular failure) or a blockage in the vas deferens that prevents sperm from reaching the semen (vas deferens obstruction). Serum FSH levels can help differentiate between these two causes. If the FSH level is high, this suggests testicular failure as the body is trying to stimulate the testes to produce sperm. If the FSH level is normal, this suggests a blockage in the vas deferens. Karyotyping is used to identify genetic abnormalities, testosterone levels can indicate overall testicular function but not specifically sperm production, and testicular FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) is an invasive procedure usually done when other tests are inconclusive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
