    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coefficient of thermal expansion is a measure of how much a material expands when it is heated. It is important in dentistry because materials with a similar coefficient to tooth will behave more like natural teeth when exposed to hot or cold temperatures. Gold inlay and gold foil are both made of gold, which has a high coefficient of thermal expansion. Acrylic resin also has a high coefficient. Silicate cement, on the other hand, has a coefficient of thermal expansion that is closer to that of tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Silicate cement\"}"
