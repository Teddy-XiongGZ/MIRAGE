    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ATP is the primary source of energy for cells. When exercising, muscles need a rapid source of energy, which is provided by the resynthesis of ATP. Among the options, Glycolysis, Glycogenolysis, and the TCA cycle are all involved in the production of ATP, but these processes are relatively slow and complex. On the other hand, Phosphocreatine provides a rapid and immediate source of ATP by donating a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. This process is much faster and provides immediate energy for exercising muscles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phosphocreatine\"}"
