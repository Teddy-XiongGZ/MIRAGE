    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulpal sensibility tests are used to assess the vitality of the tooth. Cold and heat tests are thermal tests that can sometimes give false results due to the insulating properties of the restoration material. Porcelain fused to metal crowns can act as an insulator, reducing the sensitivity of the tooth to thermal tests. EPT, or Electric Pulp Testing, is a method that uses an electric current to assess the vitality of the pulp. It is not affected by the type of restoration. Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive test that measures the oxygen saturation level in the pulp, but it's not commonly used in dental practices and can be affected by the opacity of the restoration. Therefore, EPT would be the best choice in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
