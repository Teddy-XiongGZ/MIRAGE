An experiment is a broad term that encompasses many types of scientific investigations, not just controlled trials. Intervention is the treatment or action being tested in the trial. However, the core of a controlled trial is randomization. Randomization is the process of randomly assigning subjects to different treatment groups. This ensures that each group is comparable and that the results are due to the intervention, not differences between the groups.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Randomization\"}"
