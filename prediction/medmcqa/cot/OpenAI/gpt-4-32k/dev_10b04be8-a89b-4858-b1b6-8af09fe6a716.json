    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes is usually through passive diffusion. This is because most drugs are small, lipophilic molecules that can easily cross the lipid bilayer of cells without the need for energy or carrier proteins. Facilitated diffusion, active transport, and endocytosis are also mechanisms of drug transport, but they are not as common as passive diffusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
