Germline retinoblastoma is a hereditary form of the disease.

This includes osteosarcoma, which is a type of bone cancer that often affects the long bones in the legs. The other options, such as thyroid carcinoma, seminoma, and renal cell carcinoma, can occur in the general population but are not specifically associated with germline retinoblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
