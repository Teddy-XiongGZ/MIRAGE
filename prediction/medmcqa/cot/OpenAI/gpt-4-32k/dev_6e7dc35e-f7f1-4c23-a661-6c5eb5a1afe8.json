    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"S/S spreaders and Ni-Ti spreaders are both used in endodontic procedures, specifically in the process of lateral condensation. Ni-Ti spreaders are known for their flexibility, which allows for better depth penetration and less stress generation during condensation. This flexibility also reduces the incidence of root fractures. Therefore, the statement that less depth penetration is achieved with Ni-Ti spreader is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
