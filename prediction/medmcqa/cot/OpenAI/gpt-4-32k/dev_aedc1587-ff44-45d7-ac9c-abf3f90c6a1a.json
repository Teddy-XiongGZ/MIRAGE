    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Superior semicircular canal dehiscence is a condition where there is a thinning or complete absence of the part of the temporal bone overlying the superior semicircular canal of the vestibular system. This leads to a 'third window' phenomenon, where sound or pressure waves can directly enter the inner ear, causing symptoms such as vertigo or hearing loss. This is represented in option A. Tullio's phenomenon, which is the induction of vertigo and nystagmus by loud noises, is also a characteristic feature of this condition, represented in option C. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential is indeed a useful investigation for this condition, as it can help to identify the abnormal responses caused by the third window phenomenon, represented in option D. However, SNHL, or sensorineural hearing loss, is not a characteristic feature of superior semicircular canal dehiscence. While some patients may experience hearing loss, it is typically conductive rather than sensorineural.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
