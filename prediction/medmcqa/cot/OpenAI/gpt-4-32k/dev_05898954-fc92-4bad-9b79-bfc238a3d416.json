    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The special visceral afferent (SVA) fibers of the facial nerve are responsible for taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. These fibers synapse in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, which is a sensory nucleus located in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The motor nucleus is responsible for motor functions, not sensory. The nucleus ambiguous is associated with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, not the facial nerve. The lacrimatory nucleus is not a recognized anatomical structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Nucleus of tractus solitarius\"}"
