    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coagulation cascade is divided into two pathways: the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway is activated by trauma within the vascular system, and is also activated by platelets, exposed endothelium, chemicals, or collagen. The extrinsic pathway is activated by external trauma that causes blood to escape from the vascular system. This pathway is quicker than the intrinsic pathway. Tissue thromboplastin is released from the damaged tissue during trauma, which is a part of the extrinsic pathway. Therefore, the addition of tissue thromboplastin in the test indicates that it is used to assess the extrinsic pathway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
