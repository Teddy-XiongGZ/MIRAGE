    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modulus of elasticity is a measure of a material's ability to deform under stress without breaking. In the context of dental restorations, a higher modulus of elasticity is desirable because it means the material can withstand more stress without deforming. Among the options given, Zinc phosphate cement has the highest modulus of elasticity, making it the best choice for supporting complex amalgam restorations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
