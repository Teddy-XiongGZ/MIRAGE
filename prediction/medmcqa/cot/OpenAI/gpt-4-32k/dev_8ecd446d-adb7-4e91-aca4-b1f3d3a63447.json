    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The access cavity for a mandibular first molar is typically designed to allow access to the pulp chamber and root canals. The shape of the access cavity is determined by the anatomy of the tooth. The mandibular first molar typically has two roots, one mesial and one distal, and the pulp chamber is more or less in the center of the tooth. Therefore, the access cavity is typically triangular to allow access to both roots and the pulp chamber.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Triangular\"}"
