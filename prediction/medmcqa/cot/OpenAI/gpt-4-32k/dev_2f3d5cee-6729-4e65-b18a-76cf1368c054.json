    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is not responding to multiple platelet transfusions, which suggests that the patient's body may be rejecting the transfused platelets. This can occur if the patient has developed antibodies against the HLA antigens on the platelets. A random platelet donor or a single platelet donor may not solve the problem as the patient's body may still reject the platelets. Irradiated platelets are used to prevent graft versus host disease, not to improve platelet transfusion response. Therefore, the best option would be to use HLA matched platelets, which are more likely to be accepted by the patient's body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. HLA matched platelet\"}"
