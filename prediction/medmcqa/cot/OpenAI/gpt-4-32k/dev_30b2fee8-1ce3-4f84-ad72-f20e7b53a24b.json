    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrocolloid impressions are used in dentistry to create an accurate replica of the patient's teeth and gums. The removal of this impression should be done carefully to avoid discomfort to the patient and to prevent damage to the impression. Sudden jerking (option C) can cause discomfort and potentially damage the impression. Wetting the periphery (option B) might not be effective in breaking the seal. Supporting the impression along with the tray (option D) is a good practice, but it doesn't directly contribute to the removal of the impression. Slight rocking of the impression (option A) is the best method as it helps to disengage the impression from the undercut areas without causing discomfort or damaging the impression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
