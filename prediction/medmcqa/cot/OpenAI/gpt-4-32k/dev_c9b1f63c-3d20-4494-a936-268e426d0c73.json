    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RVG, or RadioVisioGraphy, is a type of digital imaging technology used in dentistry. The bit depth of an image refers to the number of bits of data that are used to represent each pixel in the image. The higher the bit depth, the more shades of gray can be represented in the image, which can improve the image's quality and detail. In the case of RVG, the bit depth is typically 8 bit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
