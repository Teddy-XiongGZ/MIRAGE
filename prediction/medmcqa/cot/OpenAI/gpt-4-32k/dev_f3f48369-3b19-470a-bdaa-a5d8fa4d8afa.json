    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord. They happen in the first month of pregnancy, often before a woman even knows that she is pregnant. The two most common neural tube defects are spina bifida and anencephaly. In spina bifida, the fetal spinal column doesn't close completely. In anencephaly, most of the brain and skull do not develop. Doctors recommend that women who are likely to become pregnant take a daily vitamin with folic acid (folate) before conception to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Folate\"}"
