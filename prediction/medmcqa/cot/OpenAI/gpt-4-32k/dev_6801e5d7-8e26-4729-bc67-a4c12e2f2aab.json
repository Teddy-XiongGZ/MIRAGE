    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The setting time of zinc phosphate cement is influenced by the ratio of powder to liquid. An increase in the ratio of powder to liquid would speed up the setting time, not retard it. Similarly, increasing the addition of powder to liquid would also speed up the setting time. Decreasing the addition of powder to liquid would slow down the setting time, but this is not the best answer. Diluting the liquid with water would increase the liquid content, which would slow down the setting time, thus retarding it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Diluting the liquid with water\"}"
