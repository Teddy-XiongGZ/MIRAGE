    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proteoglycans are indeed composed of a core protein with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain. GAGs are long unbranched polysaccharides containing a repeating disaccharide unit, not oxidized acid sugars. The GAG chains are highly negatively charged, which makes them occupy a large volume and gives them the ability to resist compression. This means they do radiate out from the protein. Therefore, statements A and C are correct, but B is not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A and C\"}"
