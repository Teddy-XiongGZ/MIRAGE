    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Caries, or tooth decay, is a process of demineralization that results in a radiolucent or darker appearance on radiographs. Among the options, Zinc oxide eugenol, Zinc phosphate, GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement), and Polymethyl methacrylate are all dental materials. Zinc oxide eugenol is used in dentistry as a material for root canal sealing and temporary fillings, and it appears radiopaque or lighter on radiographs. Zinc phosphate is a type of cement used in dentistry that also appears radiopaque on radiographs. GIC, or Glass Ionomer Cement, is a type of restorative material used in dentistry that can mimic the appearance of caries on radiographs because it is less radiopaque than the natural tooth structure. Polymethyl methacrylate is a type of plastic used in dentistry for dentures and other prosthetics, and it is also radiopaque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
