It usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal. In the case of superimposed pre-eclampsia in a pregnant female with chronic hypertension, we would expect to see new onset proteinuria (A), a decrease in platelet count (B), and an increase in blood pressure (C).
