    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of packing resin in the sandy stage refers to the stage in denture fabrication where the resin is not fully polymerized and is still in a malleable state. If the resin is packed at this stage, it can lead to imperfections in the final product. These imperfections can manifest as porosity, which is the presence of tiny holes or voids in the material. Distortion, inhomogeneous colour, and increased strength are not typically associated with packing resin in the sandy stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Porosity\"}"
