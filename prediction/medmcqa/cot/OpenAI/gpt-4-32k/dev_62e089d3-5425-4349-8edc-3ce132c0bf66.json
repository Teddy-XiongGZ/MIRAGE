    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA replication occurs in the 5' to 3' direction, as the new DNA strand is synthesized by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of the existing strand. Similarly, transcription, the process of creating an RNA copy of a sequence of DNA, also occurs in the 5' to 3' direction. DNA repair also occurs in the 5' to 3' direction. However, RNA editing, which involves the insertion, deletion, and base modification of nucleotides within an RNA molecule, does not necessarily follow the 5' to 3' direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
