    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The compensating curve is a curve in the occlusal plane of the teeth that allows for simultaneous contact of the teeth on both sides of the mouth during mastication. It is not the same as the curve of Spee, which is an anatomic curvature of the occlusal alignment of teeth, beginning at the tip of the lower canine, following the buccal cusps of the natural premolars and molars, and continuing to the anterior border of the ramus. The compensating curve does not aid in establishing an incisal guide. Therefore, the function of the compensating curve is to provide balanced occlusion in complete dentures when the mandible is protruded.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
