    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in treating a patient who complains of inability to chew by other teeth on the same side after planning an implant in the lower molar region should be to check the occlusion in centric. This is because the problem might be due to an incorrect bite, which can be caused by the new implant. Checking the occlusion will help determine if the teeth are properly aligned when the jaws are closed. If the occlusion is off, it can cause discomfort and difficulty in chewing. Reducing the centric fossa or the supporting cusp might be necessary later, but it's not the first step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
