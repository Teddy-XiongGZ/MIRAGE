    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Wein's formula is used to estimate the working length of a root canal. According to Wein, if there is bone resorption but no tooth resorption, we should subtract 1mm from the radiographic length. This is because the radiographic apex is usually 0.5-1mm short of the anatomical apex, and in the case of bone resorption, the radiographic apex may appear even shorter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
