    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prinzmetal's angina, also known as variant angina, is a type of angina that is caused by vasospasm, a narrowing of the coronary arteries due to the tightening of the smooth muscle tissue in the vessel walls. This can occur at any time, including at rest, and is not necessarily related to physical exertion. It is not specific to the right coronary artery and does not present as inferior wall MI, so option A is incorrect. The spasm often occurs in an area of the artery that is already narrowed by atherosclerosis, not distal to it, so option B is incorrect. During an episode of Prinzmetal's angina, the ECG often shows elevation of the ST segment, not Q wave changes, and these changes resolve after the spasm subsides, so option C is also incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
