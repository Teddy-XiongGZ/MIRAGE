    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body. They do this by lowering the activation energy, which is the energy required to start a chemical reaction. They do not affect the substrate concentration or the surface tension, and they certainly do not increase the activation energy as that would slow down the reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
