    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The development of a tooth goes through several stages: the bud stage, the cap stage, the bell stage, and the advanced bell stage. The nerve fibers, which are part of the sensory system, start to appear in the vicinity of the dental papilla during the bell stage of tooth development. This is when the differentiation of the dental papilla into pulp occurs and the dental organ forms the enamel organ. The nerve fibers are not present in the bud stage or the cap stage because these are the initial stages of tooth development where the basic shape of the tooth is just starting to form. The advanced bell stage is a later stage of development where the tooth shape is finalized and the hard tissues start to form.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bell stage\"}"
