    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a fractured central incisor with the fracture line extending 4 mm gingival below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). This means that the fracture is deep and has affected the root of the tooth. The thin bone buccally and thick apicopalatally indicates that the bone support around the tooth is not uniform. The socket shield technique is a method used to preserve the periodontal ligament and buccal bone during implant placement, but it's not suitable here because the fracture is too deep. Post and core is a method used to restore a tooth that has undergone root canal treatment, but it's not suitable here because the fracture is below the CEJ. Socket preservation is a procedure performed after tooth extraction to prevent bone loss, but it's not suitable here because it doesn't address the fractured tooth. Therefore, the best treatment option in this case would be extraction of the fractured tooth and replacement with an implant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Extraction and implant\"}"
