    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ANB angle is a cephalometric measurement used to determine the anteroposterior relationship between the maxilla and the mandible. A normal ANB angle is usually between 2\u00b0 and 4\u00b0. An ANB angle of -4\u00b0 indicates a Class III skeletal relationship, meaning the mandible is positioned ahead of the maxilla. This could be due to either maxillary retrusion (hypoplasia) or mandibular protrusion (prognathism). The facial angle, also known as the Frankfort-mandibular plane angle (FMA), is used to determine the vertical growth pattern of the face. A facial angle of 98\u00b0 is within the normal range (87\u00b0-95\u00b0), indicating a normal vertical growth pattern. Therefore, the abnormality is in the anteroposterior relationship, not the vertical growth. Given these findings, the case is not of maxillary prognathism (which would indicate an overgrowth or forward positioning of the maxilla) but rather a retrusion or underdevelopment of the maxilla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Maxillary hypoplasia\"}"
