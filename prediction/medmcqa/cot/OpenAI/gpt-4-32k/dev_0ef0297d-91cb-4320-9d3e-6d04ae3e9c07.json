    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Protein synthesis in eukaryotes involves several steps and components. RNA polymerase is required for transcription, which is the first step of protein synthesis where the DNA sequence is copied into a mRNA. Ribosomes are the sites where protein synthesis occurs, they read the mRNA and translate it into a protein. Peptidyl transferase is an enzyme that is part of the large subunit of the ribosome and is responsible for the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids during translation. Amino acyl tRNA synthetase is an enzyme that attaches the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA. However, all these components are essential for protein synthesis in eukaryotes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
