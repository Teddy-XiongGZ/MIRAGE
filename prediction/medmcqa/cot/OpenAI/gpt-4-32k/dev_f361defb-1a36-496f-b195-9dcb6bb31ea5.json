    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about a legal document that allows an individual with a known psychiatric disorder to choose their caretaker and course of treatment. This is not a mental will, as a will typically refers to the distribution of assets after death. A future directive is not a recognized term in this context. A treatment directive is close, but it's not the most accurate term.
