The signs and symptoms of the condition vary widely, depending on where the growths develop and how severely a person is affected. Neuroimaging of a patient with tuberous sclerosis often shows white matter lesions, subependymal nodules, and giant cell astrocytomas. However, ependymomas, which are tumors that arise from the ependymal cells that line the ventricles of the brain and the center of the spinal cord, are not typically associated with tuberous sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
