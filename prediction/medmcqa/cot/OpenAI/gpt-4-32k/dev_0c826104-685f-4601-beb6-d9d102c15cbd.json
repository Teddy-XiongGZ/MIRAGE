    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Porosity in a denture made from methyl methacrylate resin is a result of trapped air or gases that have not been properly evacuated during the processing stage. If the flask is placed too soon, the resin may not have had enough time to properly settle and allow for the escape of these gases. The thickest part of the denture is where these gases are most likely to be trapped, as they have the furthest to travel to escape the material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. In the thickest part\"}"
