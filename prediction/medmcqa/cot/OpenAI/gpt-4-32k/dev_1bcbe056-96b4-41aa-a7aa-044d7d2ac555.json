    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint, keeping the head of your upper arm bone firmly within the shallow socket of the shoulder. An irreparable tear of the rotator cuff is a severe condition. The treatment of choice depends on the patient's age, activity level, general health, and the type of tear. In young patients, the preferred treatment is usually a tendon transfer. Total shoulder replacement and reverse shoulder replacement are usually reserved for older patients with severe arthritis or when other treatments have failed. Acromioplasty is a surgical procedure used to treat impingement syndrome and not a rotator cuff tear.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Tendon transfer\"}"
