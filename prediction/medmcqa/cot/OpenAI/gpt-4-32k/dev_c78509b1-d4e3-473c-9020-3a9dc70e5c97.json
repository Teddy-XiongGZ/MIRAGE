    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a condition that can be influenced by diet. LDL cholesterol is a type of fat that can build up in the arteries and cause CAD, so keeping levels below 100 mg/dl is a good goal. Saturated fats can also contribute to CAD, so keeping them to less than 7% of total calories is another good goal.
