    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The uvula is a small, bell-shaped piece of tissue that hangs down at the back of the mouth. It's part of the soft palate. The uvula can move because of the action of several muscles, including the musculus uvulae. The movement of the uvula is controlled by the vagus nerve, which is the tenth cranial nerve. If the uvula is deviating to one side (in this case, the left), it suggests that the vagus nerve on the opposite side (the right side) is damaged. The accessory nerve does not control the uvula, and the hypoglossal nerve controls the tongue, not the uvula.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Vagus\"}"
