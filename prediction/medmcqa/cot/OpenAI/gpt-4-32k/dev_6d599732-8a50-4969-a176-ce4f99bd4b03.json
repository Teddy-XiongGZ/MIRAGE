    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This question seems to be a bit confusing as it is asking for the definition of epidemiological surveillance using the term itself as one of the options. However, epidemiological surveillance is not defined as active, passive, or sentinel surveillance. These are types of epidemiological surveillance. Active surveillance involves actively seeking out cases, passive surveillance involves waiting for cases to be reported, and sentinel surveillance involves monitoring a subset of the population. Epidemiological surveillance is a broader term that encompasses all these types.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Epidemiological surveillance\"}"
