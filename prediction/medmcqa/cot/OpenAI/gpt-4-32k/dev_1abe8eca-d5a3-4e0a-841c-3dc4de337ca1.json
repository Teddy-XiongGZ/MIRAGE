    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The master apical file (MAF) is a term used in endodontics, specifically in root canal treatment. It is not the last file used for obturation, nor is it the initial file used for initial radiographic working length. It is also not the smaller file used in between other files during biomechanical preparation. The MAF is the last file used to shape and clean the apical part of the root canal system, so it is used for the removal of soft debris from the root canal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
