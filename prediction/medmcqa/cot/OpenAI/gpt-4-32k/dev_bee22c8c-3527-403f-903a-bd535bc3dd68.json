    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High pressure oxygen through cannula has several advantages. A. Bypassing nasopharyngeal dead space: This is an advantage as it allows for more efficient oxygen delivery. B. Decreases need for intubation: This is also an advantage as it can reduce the need for more invasive procedures like intubation. C. PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure): This is an advantage as it helps to keep the airways open. D. Hot and Humidification of air: This is not an obvious advantage of high pressure oxygen through cannula. While humidification can help to prevent drying of the airways, it is not directly related to the use of high pressure oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
