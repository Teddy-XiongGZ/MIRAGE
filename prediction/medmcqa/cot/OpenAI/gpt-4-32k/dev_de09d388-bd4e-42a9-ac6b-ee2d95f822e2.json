    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a newborn with cyanosis and an X-ray showing 'oligaemic lung field' which means reduced blood flow to the lungs, and a normal-sized heart. Ebstein's anomaly usually presents with an enlarged heart, so it can be ruled out. Transposition of the great arteries usually presents with a normal or increased pulmonary blood flow, so it can also be ruled out. Tetralogy of Fallot usually presents with a boot-shaped heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy, so it can be ruled out. Pulmonary atresia is characterized by cyanosis and decreased pulmonary blood flow, which matches the description in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pulmonary atresia\"}"
