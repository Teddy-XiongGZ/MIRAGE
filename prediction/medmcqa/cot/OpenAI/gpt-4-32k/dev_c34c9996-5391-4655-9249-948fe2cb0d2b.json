    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vasopressors are used to increase blood pressure. In pregnancy, the choice of vasopressor is important because some can cross the placenta and affect the fetus. Ephedrine, for example, can cross the placenta and cause fetal tachycardia. Phenylephrine, on the other hand, has been shown to be safe and effective in pregnancy. It does not cross the placenta and therefore does not have the same risks as ephedrine. Methoxamine and Mephentermine are not commonly used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Phenylephrine\"}"
