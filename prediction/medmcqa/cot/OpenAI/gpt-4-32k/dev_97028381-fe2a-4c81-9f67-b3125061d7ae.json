    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"TMJ ankylosis refers to the fusion of the mandibular condyle to the base of the skull, resulting in restricted jaw movement. Theories of TMJ ankylosis include calcification in the soft tissues around the joint space, lateral displacement of fracture condyle with fusion with zygomatic bone, and condylar burst. However, synovial fluid attracting calcium ions is not a theory of TMJ ankylosis. Synovial fluid is a viscous, non-Newtonian fluid found in the cavities of synovial joints. Its primary function is to reduce friction between the articular cartilage of synovial joints during movement. While calcium ions are present in synovial fluid, they do not directly cause TMJ ankylosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
