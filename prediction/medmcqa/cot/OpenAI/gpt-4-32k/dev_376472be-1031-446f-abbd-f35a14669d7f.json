    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child had a fractured maxillary central incisor 10 months ago and the pulp shows no response, which indicates pulp necrosis. There is no periapical lesion in the radiograph, which means there is no infection or abscess at the tip of the root. Pulp capping and pulpotomy are treatments for vital pulp, not necrotic pulp. Apexification is a method to induce a calcified barrier in a root with an open apex or the continued apical development of an incomplete root in children, but in this case, the pulp is necrotic. Therefore, the best treatment option is a conventional root canal treatment, which involves removing the necrotic pulp, cleaning and shaping the root canal, and then filling and sealing the canal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
