    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient delivered a baby with normal expulsion of an intact placenta, but started bleeding vaginally half an hour later. She was found to be hypotensive and a boggy mass was palpated per abdomen. An ultrasound showed retained placental tissues. This suggests that not all of the placenta was expelled during childbirth, leading to postpartum hemorrhage. Placenta succenturiata refers to a condition where there is an extra lobe to the placenta, which is not the case here. Adenomyosis is a condition where the inner lining of the uterus breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus, which is not related to the symptoms. Placenta accreta is a serious pregnancy condition that occurs when the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall, but in this case, the placenta was expelled normally. Membranous placenta is a rare condition where the placenta develops without the usual amount of chorionic villi, which is not related to the symptoms. Therefore, none of the options seem to fit the diagnosis perfectly, but the closest one would be placenta accreta, as it can sometimes lead to retained placental tissues and postpartum hemorrhage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Placenta accreta\"}"
