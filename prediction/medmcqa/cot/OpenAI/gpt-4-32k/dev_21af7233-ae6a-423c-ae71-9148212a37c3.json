    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle contraction is initiated by a complex interaction of proteins. Calcium ions play a crucial role in this process. They do not bind directly to actin or myosin, which are the main contractile proteins. Instead, calcium ions bind to the protein troponin, which is part of the thin filament along with actin and tropomyosin. When calcium binds to troponin, it causes a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to bind to actin and initiate muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Troponin\"}"
