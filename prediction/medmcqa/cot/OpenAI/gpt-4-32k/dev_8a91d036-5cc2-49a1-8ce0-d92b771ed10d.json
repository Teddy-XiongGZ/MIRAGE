    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the nerve fibers that are stimulated to detect pain or in conditions like reversible pulpitis and pulp hyperemia. Pain is typically transmitted by A delta and C fibers. A delta fibers are responsible for the initial sharp pain that occurs, while C fibers are responsible for the dull, throbbing pain that follows. Therefore, sharp, shooting pain in reversible pulpitis would indicate stimulation of A delta fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. A delta\"}"
