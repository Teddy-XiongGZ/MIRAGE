    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The facial nerve is a key structure in the face, responsible for motor innervation of the facial muscles. The Superficial Musculo-Aponeurotic System (SMAS) is a layer of tissue under the skin of the face and neck, and the parotidomassetric fascia is a layer of tissue that covers the parotid gland and masseter muscle. The facial nerve is located deep to the SMAS, meaning it is below the SMAS. It is also located superficial to the parotidomassetric fascia, meaning it is above the parotidomassetric fascia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Below SMAS and above parotidomassetric fascia\"}"
