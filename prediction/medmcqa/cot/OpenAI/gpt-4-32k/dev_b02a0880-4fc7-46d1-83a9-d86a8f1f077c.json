In the first few weeks of pregnancy, before the placenta is fully formed, the corpus luteum, which is the remnant of the follicle that has released the egg, produces these hormones.

Therefore, the fetal ovaries and adrenal are not involved in the production of these hormones during this period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Corpus luteum\"}"
