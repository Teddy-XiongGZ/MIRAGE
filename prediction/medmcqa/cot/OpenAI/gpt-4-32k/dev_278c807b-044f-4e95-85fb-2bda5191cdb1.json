    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mechanical advantage to prevent proximal displacement of the restoration in a MO cavity prepared for inlay. A. Adequate pulpal depth is not directly related to preventing proximal displacement. B. Parallel walls can help in retention but not specifically in preventing proximal displacement. D. Acute lingual inclination in axiogingival area is not directly related to preventing proximal displacement. C. Occlusal dovetail is the correct answer because it is a design feature in inlay preparations that prevents the restoration from being dislodged in a proximal direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
