In this case, the girl has a 21/21 translocation, which means that two copies of chromosome 21 have been translocated or rearranged. If the father is a balanced translocation carrier, it means he carries a rearranged chromosome but does not have any symptoms because he has the correct amount of genetic material. The risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies depends on the specific type of translocation. In this case, if the father is a balanced carrier of a 21/21 translocation, the risk of recurrence is 100% because every sperm he produces will carry the translocation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
