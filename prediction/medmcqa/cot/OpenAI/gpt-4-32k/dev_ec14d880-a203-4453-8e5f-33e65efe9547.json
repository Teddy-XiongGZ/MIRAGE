    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is an essential nutrient that all tissues of the body need to function properly. Thiamine deficiency is typically assessed by measuring the activity of an enzyme called transketolase in erythrocytes (red blood cells). This enzyme requires thiamine to function, so its activity level can indicate whether there is a sufficient amount of thiamine in the body. The other options, such as RBS Glutathione reductase, RBC thiamine levels, and Serum thiamine level, are not standard methods for assessing thiamine deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
