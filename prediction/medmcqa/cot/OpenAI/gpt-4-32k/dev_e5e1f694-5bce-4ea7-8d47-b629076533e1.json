    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"IUGR stands for Intrauterine Growth Restriction, which is a condition where a baby doesn't grow to normal weight while inside the mother's womb. The best parameter for ultrasound evaluation of IUGR would be a measurement that directly relates to the baby's size. The placental membrane (A) is not a direct measure of the baby's size. The length of the femur (B) could be a good indicator, but it only measures one aspect of the baby's size. The BPD (D), or Biparietal Diameter, is a measure of the baby's head size, which can be useful but again only provides information about one aspect of the baby's size. The abdominal circumference (C), however, provides a more comprehensive measure of the baby's overall size and growth, making it the best parameter for ultrasound evaluation of IUGR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
