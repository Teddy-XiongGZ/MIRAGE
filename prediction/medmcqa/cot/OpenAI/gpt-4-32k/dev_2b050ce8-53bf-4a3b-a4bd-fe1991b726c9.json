    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 'bat with extended wings' description is often used to describe the shape of a specific bone in the human skull. The ethmoid bone is a small, unpaired bone in the skull that separates the nasal cavity from the brain, so it doesn't fit the description. The nasal bone is a small rectangular bone that forms the bridge of the nose, so it also doesn't fit the description. The mandible is the lower jawbone, and it doesn't resemble a bat with extended wings. The sphenoid bone, however, is often described as looking like a bat or a butterfly with its wings extended because of its shape and the greater and lesser wings it has.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Sphenoid\"}"
