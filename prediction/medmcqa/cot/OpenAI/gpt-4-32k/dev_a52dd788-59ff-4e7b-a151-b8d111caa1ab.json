    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyperkalemia is a condition characterized by high levels of potassium in the blood. The management of hyperkalemia includes various strategies to lower the potassium levels. Calcium gluconate is used to protect the heart from the effects of hyperkalemia. Insulin helps to shift potassium from the blood into the cells. Salbutamol nebulisation also promotes the shift of potassium into cells. However, MgSO4 (Magnesium Sulfate) is not typically used in the management of hyperkalemia. It is used in conditions like eclampsia or severe asthma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
