    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mobility of a protein on gel electrophoresis is determined by its size and charge. In the case of sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS), a point mutation has replaced glutamic acid, which is negatively charged, with valine, which is neutral. This change in charge could potentially affect the protein's mobility on the gel. However, the overall size of the protein has not changed significantly, as only one amino acid has been replaced. Therefore, the mobility of HbS compared to normal hemoglobin should be unchanged.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Unchanged\"}"
