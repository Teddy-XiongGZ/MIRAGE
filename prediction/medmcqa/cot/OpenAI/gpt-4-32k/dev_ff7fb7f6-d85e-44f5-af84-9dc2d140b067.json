    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Addison's disease is a disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of their hormones. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a common symptom of Addison's disease because the adrenal glands are involved in regulating blood sugar levels. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is also a common symptom because the adrenal glands produce aldosterone, a hormone that helps regulate blood pressure. Hyponatremia, or low sodium levels, can also occur in Addison's disease due to the lack of aldosterone. However, hypocalcaemia, or low calcium levels, is not typically associated with Addison's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
