    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of progressive lower limb weakness, spasticity, and hesitancy of micturition, along with the evidence of dorsal myelopathy, suggest a spinal cord lesion. The MRI findings of a middorsal intradural contrast enhancing mass lesion further support this. Intradural lipomas are usually congenital and present early in life, so it's less likely in a middle-aged patient. Dermoid and epidermoid cysts are also possibilities, but they typically don't enhance with contrast. Meningiomas, on the other hand, are often intradural, can cause the symptoms described, and are known to enhance with contrast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Meningioma\"}"
