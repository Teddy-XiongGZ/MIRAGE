    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiazides are a type of diuretic that work by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron in the kidneys. This leads to an increase in sodium excretion, or in other words, a decrease in urinary sodium. Because of the increased sodium in the tubule, there is also an increased loss of potassium and hydrogen ions, leading to a decrease in urinary potassium. However, thiazides also increase the reabsorption of calcium in the distal tubule, leading to a decrease in urinary calcium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Sodium and potassium decreases, calcium decreases\"}"
