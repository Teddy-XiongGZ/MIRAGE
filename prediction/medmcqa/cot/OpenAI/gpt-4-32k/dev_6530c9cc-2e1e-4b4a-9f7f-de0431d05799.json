    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cell junctions are structures within tissues that allow cells to connect with each other. There are several types of cell junctions, each with a different function. Tight junctions create a seal between cells, preventing the passage of molecules. Anchoring junctions provide mechanical stability and hold cells together. Focal junctions are involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction. Gap junctions, however, allow the exchange of cytoplasmic molecules between two cells, which is the function described in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
