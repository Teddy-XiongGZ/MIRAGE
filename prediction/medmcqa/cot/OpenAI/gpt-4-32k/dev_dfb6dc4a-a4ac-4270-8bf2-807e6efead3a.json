    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Warfarin is a known teratogen and can cause warfarin embryopathy, especially when used in the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, it is not advisable to continue warfarin throughout the pregnancy. Acenocoumarin is also a vitamin K antagonist like warfarin and can have similar teratogenic effects, so it is not a good option either. Heparin, on the other hand, does not cross the placenta and is safe to use in pregnancy. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin is preferred over unfractionated heparin due to its more predictable pharmacokinetics and lower risk of osteoporosis with long-term use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Use LMW heparin\"}"
