    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reamers and files are both tools used in dentistry, specifically in endodontics for root canal treatment. The main difference between them lies in their design and function. Reamers are used to enlarge the canal and have fewer flutes on the blade, while files have more flutes and are used for cleaning and shaping the canal. Therefore, the statement that reamers have more flutes is incorrect. The cross-section of reamers and files can vary, but it's not accurate to say that all reamers are square and all files are triangular. The statement about files having two superficial grooves to produce flutes in a double helix design is also not universally true. So, the most accurate statement is that files have more flutes than reamers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
