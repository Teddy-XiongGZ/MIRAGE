    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The posterior palatal seal area is the part of the maxillary complete denture that extends into the soft tissue area behind the hard palate. Its purpose is to improve the retention and stability of the denture. If the depth in this area is increased, it would lead to better suction and thus better retention of the denture. It would not cause a tingling sensation, gagging, or unseating of the denture base.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increased retention\"}"
