    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepcidin is a hormone produced by the liver. It plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis by regulating the absorption, storage, and distribution of iron in the body. Hepcidin achieves this by binding to ferroportin, a protein that exports iron from cells. When hepcidin binds to ferroportin, it causes the degradation of ferroportin, thereby inhibiting the export of iron from cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Ferropoin\"}"
