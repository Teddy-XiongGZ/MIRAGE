    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiotherapy can cause a decrease in salivary flow, leading to xerostomia or dry mouth. Saliva plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health by neutralizing acids produced by bacteria and washing away food particles. A decrease in salivary flow can lead to an increase in the risk of tooth decay.

Hypocalcification and pitting of enamel can occur due to various reasons, but they are not the initial triggers of tooth decay following radiotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
