    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The vascular events of inflammation occur in a specific order. First, there is an immediate transient response, which is due to mast cell activation leading to the release of histamine and bradykinin. This is followed by an immediate prolonged response, which is due to direct endothelial injury by bacterial toxins. After this, there is a somewhat delayed prolonged response, which can be due to sun exposure or heat stroke leading to mild endothelial injury. Finally, there is a delayed prolonged response, which is leukocyte-mediated injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. ABCD\"}"
