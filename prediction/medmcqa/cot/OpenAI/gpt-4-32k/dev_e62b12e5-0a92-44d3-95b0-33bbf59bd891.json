    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA methylation is a biological process by which methyl groups are added to the DNA molecule. It is known to play a crucial role in gene silencing, so option C is incorrect. It is also involved in DNA replication, where it ensures the proper functioning of the DNA molecule, so option B is incorrect. DNA methylation is also involved in mismatch repair, where it helps in the correction of errors that occur during DNA replication, so option A is incorrect. DNA capping, on the other hand, is a process that occurs in the formation of mRNA, not DNA, and it does not involve methylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
