    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spinocerebellar ataxia, supranuclear palsy, corticobasillar degeneration, and multiple system atrophy are all neurodegenerative diseases. However, they do not only affect neurons. For example, multiple system atrophy also affects the autonomic nervous system and the motor system. Similarly, corticobasillar degeneration affects not only neurons but also glial cells. Supranuclear palsy affects both neurons and glial cells. Spinocerebellar ataxia, on the other hand, primarily affects neurons in the cerebellum and spinal cord, but it can also affect other parts of the nervous system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
