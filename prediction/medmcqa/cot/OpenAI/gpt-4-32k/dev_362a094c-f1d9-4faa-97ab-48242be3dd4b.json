    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zone of stimulation is a term used in bone physiology. It is the area where new bone formation occurs. This process involves several types of cells. Fibroblasts are cells that produce collagen and other fibers and are involved in the healing process of the bones. Osteoblasts are cells that synthesize bone, while osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption, or breakdown. Therefore, all these cells are involved in the process of bone formation and remodeling, except for osteoclasts which are involved in bone resorption, not stimulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Osteoclasts\"}"
