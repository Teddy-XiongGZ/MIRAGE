    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A direct impact on the bone, such as a fall or a blow, can cause different types of fractures. A transverse fracture occurs when the fracture line is perpendicular to the shaft of the bone, which can be caused by a direct blow. An oblique fracture has an angled pattern and usually occurs from a fall. A spiral fracture occurs when a twisting force is applied to the bone. A comminuted fracture is when the bone shatters into three or more pieces, usually as a result of severe force. In this case, a direct impact is most likely to cause a transverse fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
