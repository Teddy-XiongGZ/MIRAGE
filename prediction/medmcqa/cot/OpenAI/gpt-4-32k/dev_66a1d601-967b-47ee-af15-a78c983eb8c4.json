    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glickman's study on dental plaque accumulation suggests that the maximum accumulation of plaque occurs within a certain time frame. This is not as short as 7 days, as plaque accumulation is a gradual process. It's also not as long as 60 days, as by this time, most of the plaque would have already formed and started causing damage.
