    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the best noninvasive investigation to check for the viability of myocardium, which means to check if the heart muscle is alive or not. FDG-18 PET CT is a type of imaging test that can show how tissues and organs are functioning. MIBG scintigraphy is a type of nuclear medicine imaging test. It is used to diagnose certain kinds of cancer, but not typically used for heart muscle viability. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of the heart, which can show the heart's structure and function. Thallium scintigraphy is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how well blood flows into the heart muscle, both at rest and during activity. It is commonly used to check for heart muscle viability. Therefore, the best noninvasive investigation to check for the viability of myocardium is Thallium scintigraphy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
