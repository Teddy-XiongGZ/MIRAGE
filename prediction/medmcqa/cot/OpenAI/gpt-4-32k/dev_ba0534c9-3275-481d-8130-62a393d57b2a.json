    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The craniovertebral joint is the joint formed between the skull and the first two vertebrae of the spine, the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2). The occipital condyles of the skull articulate with the atlas to form the atlanto-occipital joint, which allows nodding of the head. The axis has a bony prominence, the dens, which articulates with the atlas to form the atlanto-axial joint, allowing rotation of the head. The wings of the sphenoid bone are part of the skull but do not participate in the craniovertebral joint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Wings of sphenoid\"}"
