    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"End systolic volume (ESV) is the volume of blood in a ventricle at the end of contraction, or systole, and the beginning of filling, or diastole. During exercise, the heart rate increases to pump more blood to the muscles. This increased heart rate results in a decrease in the end systolic volume because the heart is pumping out more blood with each contraction. Therefore, the volume of blood left in the ventricle after systole decreases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. ESV decreases\"}"
