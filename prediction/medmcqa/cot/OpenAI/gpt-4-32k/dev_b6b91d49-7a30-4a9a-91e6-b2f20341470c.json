    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The human spine has natural curves that form an 'S' shape when viewed from the side. These curves help to distribute mechanical stress as we move. The cervical and lumbar regions of the spine have a lordotic, or inward, curvature. The thoracic and sacral regions have a kyphotic, or outward, curvature. Scoliosis refers to a lateral, or sideways, curvature of the spine. Recurvatum is a deformity where the knee bends backwards. Therefore, the normal curvature seen in the lumbar region is lordosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
