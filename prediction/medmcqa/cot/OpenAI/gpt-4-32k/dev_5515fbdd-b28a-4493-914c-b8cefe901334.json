    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Perinatal mortality refers to the death of a fetus or neonate and is a critical indicator of maternal and infant health. The numerator in perinatal mortality includes both stillbirths and early neonatal deaths. Stillbirths are typically defined as fetal deaths at 20 weeks of gestation or more, or a birth weight of 500g or more. Early neonatal deaths are deaths among live births during the first 7 days of life. Therefore, the answer should include both stillbirths and early neonatal deaths.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
