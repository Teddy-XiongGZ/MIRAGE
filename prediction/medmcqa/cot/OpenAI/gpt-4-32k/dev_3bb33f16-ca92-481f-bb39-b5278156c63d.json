    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has increased Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), and Thrombin Time (TT), but normal fibrinogen and platelet counts. This suggests a problem with the coagulation cascade, but not with platelet function or fibrinogen levels. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) usually presents with low platelet count and low fibrinogen, so it's not the answer. Factor VIII deficiency would only affect APTT, not PT or TT, so it's not the answer. Vitamin K deficiency would affect PT and possibly APTT, but not TT, so it's not the answer. Liver disease, however, can affect all three (PT, APTT, TT) because the liver produces most of the clotting factors involved in these tests.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Liver disease\"}"
