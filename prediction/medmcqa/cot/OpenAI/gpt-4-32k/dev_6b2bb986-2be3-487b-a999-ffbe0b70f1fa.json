    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apex locators are devices used in endodontics to determine the position of the apical foramen. They have evolved over time, with each generation improving on the technology of the previous one. The first generation used resistance measurements, the second generation used impedance measurements, and the third generation used multiple frequencies to measure impedance. The split impedance based apex locator is the second generation of apex locators.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
