    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Korff's fibers are a type of fiber found in the dental pulp. They are associated with the formation of dentin, a hard tissue that forms the bulk of the tooth. Mantle dentin is the first type of dentin formed and does not contain Korff's fibers. Secondary dentin is formed after the tooth has erupted and also does not contain Korff's fibers. Reactionary dentin is formed in response to stimuli such as caries or wear and tear, and it is here that Korff's fibers are involved. Indeed dermal tubules is not a term related to dentin or dental pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Reactionary dentin\"}"
