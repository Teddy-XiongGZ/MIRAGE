    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a renal laceration and urinoma following a blunt trauma to the abdomen. Even after 12 days, the urinoma persists, but the patient is stable and there is no fever. This suggests that the body is not able to resolve the urinoma on its own. Percutaneous exploration and repair (option A) is usually reserved for unstable patients or those with severe injuries. A J-shaped urinary stent (option C) is typically used for obstructions in the urinary tract, which is not the case here. Waiting and watching (option B) may not be the best approach given that the urinoma has persisted for 12 days. Percutaneous nephrostomy (option D) is a procedure that can be used to drain the urinoma, which seems to be the most appropriate next step in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
