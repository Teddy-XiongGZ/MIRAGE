    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy. Beta-oxidation of fatty acids (A) is a metabolic process that takes place in mitochondria. It involves the breakdown of fatty acids into two-carbon fragments, which are then converted into acetyl CoA, a substrate for the Krebs cycle. DNA synthesis (B) also occurs in mitochondria, as they have their own DNA separate from the cell's nuclear DNA. Protein synthesis (D) also occurs in mitochondria, as they have their own ribosomes for this purpose. However, fatty acid synthesis (C) does not occur in mitochondria. This process takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
