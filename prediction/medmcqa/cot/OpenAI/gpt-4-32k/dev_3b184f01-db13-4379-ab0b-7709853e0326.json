    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Jaundice is a condition that causes yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It is caused by an excess of bilirubin, a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells in the liver. In this case, the patient has 50% direct bilirubin, which means that the bilirubin is conjugated in the liver but is not being excreted properly. This rules out Gilbert syndrome and Rotor syndrome, which are characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Glucuronyl transferase deficiency also leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Primary biliary cirrhosis, on the other hand, is a disease in which the bile ducts in the liver are slowly destroyed, preventing bile from being carried out of the liver. This can lead to a buildup of direct bilirubin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Primary biliary cirrhosis\"}"
