    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingival recession is a condition where the gum tissue that surrounds the teeth wears away, or pulls back, exposing more of the tooth, or the tooth's root. The Stillman brushing technique is designed to massage the gums and stimulate blood flow to the gingival tissue, which can be beneficial for people with gingival recession. The Modified Stillman technique is an improvement over the Stillman technique, as it also includes a brushing motion to clean the teeth. The Bass and Charter techniques are not specifically designed for gingival recession.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Modified stillman\"}"
