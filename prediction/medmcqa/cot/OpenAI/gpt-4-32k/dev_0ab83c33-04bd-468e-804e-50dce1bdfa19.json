    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The TNM classification system stands for Tumor, Node, Metastasis. T refers to the size of the original (primary) tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N describes nearby (regional) lymph nodes that are involved, and M describes distant metastasis. In this case, the primary tumor is unknown, so T would be represented as 'Tx'. The lymph node is involved, and it is a single, ipsilateral node, which corresponds to 'N2a'. There is no distant metastasis, so M would be 'M0'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. T0N2aM0\"}"
