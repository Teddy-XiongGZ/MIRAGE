    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The interocclusal distance refers to the space between the upper and lower teeth when the jaw is at rest. If this distance is increased beyond normal limits, it can lead to various problems. A muscular imbalance (option A) could be a result, but it's not the most direct consequence. An occlusal disharmony in centric (option B) refers to a misalignment of the teeth when the jaw is closed, which could be a result of an increased interocclusal distance. A displacement of the mandibular denture (option C) could also occur if the interocclusal distance is too large. However, a displacement of the maxillary denture while yawning (option D) is not directly related to the interocclusal distance. Therefore, the most direct and likely complaint from a patient with an increased interocclusal distance would be an occlusal disharmony in centric.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
