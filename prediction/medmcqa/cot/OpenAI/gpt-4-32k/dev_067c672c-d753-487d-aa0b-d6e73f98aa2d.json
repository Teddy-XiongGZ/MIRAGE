    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Coronary artery disease is a condition that develops when the major blood vessels that supply your heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients become damaged or diseased. Risk factors for coronary artery disease include smoking, which damages the lining of your arteries, leading to a buildup of fatty plaque that can cause a heart attack. Increased fibrinogen levels can also contribute to the development of coronary artery disease, as fibrinogen is a protein in your body that helps blood clot. When its levels are high, your risk of developing blood clots in your arteries increases. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can also damage your arteries and lead to heart disease. However, moderate alcohol consumption is not a risk factor for coronary artery disease. In fact, some research suggests that moderate alcohol consumption might be associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
