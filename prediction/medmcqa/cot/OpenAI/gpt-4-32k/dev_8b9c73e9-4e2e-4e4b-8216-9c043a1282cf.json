    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Simple random sampling is a basic sampling technique where each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance, such that each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process. This method is best suited for a population where every individual is similar, or homogeneous, because it assumes that every individual has an equal chance of being selected. This would not be ideal for a heterogeneous population where there are significant differences among the individuals. Vaccinated people could be either a homogeneous or heterogeneous group depending on other factors, so it's not a clear choice. Therefore, the best answer is a homogeneous population.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
