    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The HCO3/H2CO3 system is the primary buffer in the human body. It is a combination of a weak acid (H2CO3) and a weak base (HCO3-), which is true but not the main reason it is the best buffer. It can accept and donate H+ ions, which is a characteristic of all buffers, not just this one. Its components can be increased or decreased in the body as needed, which is a unique feature but not the primary reason it is the best buffer. The key feature that makes it the best buffer is that its pKa is near the physiological pH (7.4), which means it can effectively neutralize both acids and bases in the body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
