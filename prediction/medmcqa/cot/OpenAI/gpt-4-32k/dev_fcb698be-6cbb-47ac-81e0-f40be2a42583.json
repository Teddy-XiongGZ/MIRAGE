    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of severe throbbing pain, sensitivity to hot and cold food, and a painful response to percussion are indicative of pulpitis, which is inflammation of the dental pulp. This can be caused by deep decay, repeated dental procedures on the tooth, or a crack or chip in the tooth. The treatment of choice for pulpitis is endodontic therapy, also known as root canal treatment, which involves removing the inflamed or infected pulp, carefully cleaning and shaping the inside of the tooth, then filling and sealing the space. Incision and drainage of the periapical area is typically done for an abscess, which is not indicated here. Indirect pulp capping is a procedure done to stimulate the pulp to form dentin and maintain pulp vitality, which is not the case here. Partial pulpectomy is a procedure done to relieve symptoms of irreversible pulpitis in primary teeth, which is not applicable here as the patient has issues with a permanent tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Endodontic therapy\"}"
