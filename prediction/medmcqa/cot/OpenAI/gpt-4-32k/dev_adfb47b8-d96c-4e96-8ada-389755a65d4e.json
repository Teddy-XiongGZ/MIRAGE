    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, there are several physiological changes that occur to support the growing fetus and prepare the body for childbirth. Minute volume, which is the amount of air moved in and out of the lungs per minute, increases due to the increased oxygen demand of the mother and fetus. Blood volume also increases to supply the placenta and fetus with necessary nutrients and oxygen. Cardiac output, the amount of blood the heart pumps through the circulatory system in a minute, also increases to accommodate the increased blood volume. However, the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which measures how well the kidneys filter waste from the blood, does not increase at full term. It increases in the first and second trimesters but then decreases to pre-pregnancy levels in the third trimester.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. GFR\" }"
