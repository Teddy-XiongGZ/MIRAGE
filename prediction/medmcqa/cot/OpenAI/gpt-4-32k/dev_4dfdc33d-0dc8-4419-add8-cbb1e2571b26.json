    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zinc phosphate cement (ZnPO4) is a dental cement often used in dentistry. The setting time of ZnPO4 can be influenced by several factors. Adding a drop of distilled water (A) would dilute the mixture, thus prolonging the setting time. Prolonging the spatulation time (B) would also delay the setting time as it allows for more thorough mixing and slows down the chemical reaction. Mixing on a cooled glass slab (D) would slow down the chemical reaction due to the lower temperature, thus prolonging the setting time. However, adding small increments of powder to the liquid (C) would actually speed up the setting time because it increases the concentration of the mixture, thus accelerating the chemical reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
