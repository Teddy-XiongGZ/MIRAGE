    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The strain on the heart during pregnancy is due to the increased blood volume and cardiac output to support both the mother and the developing fetus. This strain is not constant throughout the pregnancy. It gradually increases as the pregnancy progresses. However, the maximum strain on the heart occurs immediately postpartum.
