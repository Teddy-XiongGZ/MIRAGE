    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mouth breathing can be caused by several factors, including both obstructive and non-obstructive causes. Obstructive causes are those that physically block the airway, making it difficult for air to pass through the nose and into the lungs. A deviated nasal septum, narrow maxilla, and obstructive adenoids are all examples of obstructive causes, as they can physically block the airway. On the other hand, a short lip does not obstruct the airway. It may affect the appearance and function of the mouth, but it does not physically block the passage of air.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
