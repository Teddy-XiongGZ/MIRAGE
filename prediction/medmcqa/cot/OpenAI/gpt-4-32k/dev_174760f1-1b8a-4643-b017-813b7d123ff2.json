    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluid resuscitation is a critical part of managing patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The goal is to restore perfusion to vital organs. Urine output can be a good indicator of renal perfusion, but it can be influenced by other factors such as diuretics. Pulse rate can be influenced by many factors such as anxiety, pain, fever, medications, etc. Blood pressure is also a good indicator of perfusion, but it can be maintained until late in shock due to compensatory mechanisms. Central Venous Pressure (CVP) is a direct measure of the blood pressure in the right atrium or the superior vena cava. It is a good indicator of fluid status and cardiac function, and it can be used to guide fluid resuscitation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
