    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FNAC stands for Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology. It is a diagnostic procedure used to investigate lumps or swellings. In this technique, a thin, hollow needle is inserted into the lump to extract cells that will be examined under a microscope. Papillary, anaplastic, and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid can be diagnosed by FNAC as they have distinctive cellular features. However, follicular carcinoma of the thyroid is difficult to diagnose with FNAC because it shares many cytological features with benign follicular adenoma. The definitive diagnosis of follicular carcinoma requires histological evidence of capsular and/or vascular invasion, which cannot be assessed by FNAC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Follicular carcinoma of thyroid\"}"
