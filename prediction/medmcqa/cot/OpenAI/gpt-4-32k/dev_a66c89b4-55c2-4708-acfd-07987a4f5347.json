    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation that can damage living tissues. Different tissues in the body have different sensitivities to X-ray radiation. The most sensitive tissues are those that are rapidly dividing, such as the cells in the bone marrow, the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, and the cells in developing embryos. Among the options given, tooth buds and salivary glands are the most sensitive to X-ray radiation. Tooth buds are the developing teeth in children and are rapidly dividing, making them sensitive to radiation. Salivary glands also have cells that divide rapidly and are sensitive to radiation. Nerve and muscle tissue, hair and nails, and cartilage do not divide as rapidly and are less sensitive to radiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
