    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Plasticizers are substances that are added to synthetic resins to increase their plasticity or flexibility. They are used to reduce the hardness and brittleness of the material, making it more workable and durable. They do not increase the smoothness or bulk of the material, nor do they prevent polymerisation shrinkage. However, they do reduce the softening and fusion temperature of the material, making it easier to mold and shape.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
