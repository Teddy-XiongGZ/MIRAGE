    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has a necrotic pulp, which means the pulp tissue inside the tooth has died. This is a serious condition that can lead to an abscess or systemic infection if not treated. Watchful observation (option A) is not appropriate in this case because the condition is already advanced and requires treatment. Extraction followed by space maintainer (option B) could be considered, but it's generally better to try to save the tooth if possible, especially in a child. Pulpectomy and root canal filling with gutta percha (option C) is a common treatment for necrotic pulp, but in children, it's often better to use a material that can be resorbed by the body as the tooth continues to develop. This makes option D, endodontic treatment and root canal filling with ZOE (zinc oxide eugenol), the best choice. ZOE is a material that can be resorbed by the body and is often used in pediatric dentistry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
