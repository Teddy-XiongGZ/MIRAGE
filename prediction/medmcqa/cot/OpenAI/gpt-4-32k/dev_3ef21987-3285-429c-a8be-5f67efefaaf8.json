    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontal fibers are part of the periodontal ligament and play a crucial role in supporting the teeth. The transseptal fibers are the only group of fibers that are capable of regeneration even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. They run interdentally from the cervical area of one tooth over to an adjacent tooth and are responsible for resisting tooth separation. The other fibers, such as apical, alveolar crest group, and oblique, do not have this regenerative capability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Transseptal\"}"
