    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GA stands for General Anesthesia. The organ most resistant to general anesthesia is the one that continues to function despite the presence of the anesthetic. The spinal cord, medulla oblongata, and cerebrum are all part of the central nervous system, which is generally sensitive to anesthesia. The medullary cortex, on the other hand, is part of the kidney and is not directly affected by anesthesia. Therefore, the medullary cortex would be the most resistant to general anesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Medullary cortex\"}"
