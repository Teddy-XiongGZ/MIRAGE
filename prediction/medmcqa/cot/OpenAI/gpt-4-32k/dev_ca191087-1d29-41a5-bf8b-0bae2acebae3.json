    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The condyle is a part of the mandible, or jawbone. In a subcondylar fracture, the condyle is broken and dislocated. The lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for opening the jaw and moving it side to side. When this muscle contracts, it pulls the condyle forward and medially, or towards the middle. Therefore, if the condyle is fractured, the lateral pterygoid muscle could cause it to dislocate medially.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Lateral pterygoid\"}"
