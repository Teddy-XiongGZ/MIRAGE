    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel is the hardest substance in the human body and it is the outermost layer of the teeth. It is composed of hydroxyapatite, a crystalline structure that is also found in bones. Despite its hardness, enamel is not static and undergoes a process called remineralization, where minerals are deposited back into the enamel after being removed by acids. This process of ionic exchange between the enamel surface and the environment does not stop once the enamel matures, nor does it stop after 2 years of eruption. It continues throughout the individual's life, as long as there are teeth present in the mouth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Continues through out life\"}"
