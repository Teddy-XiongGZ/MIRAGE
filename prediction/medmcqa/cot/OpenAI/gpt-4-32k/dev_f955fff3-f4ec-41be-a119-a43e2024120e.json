    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parotid gland is innervated by both parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers. The parasympathetic fibers are secretomotor, meaning they stimulate the gland to secrete saliva, which is true (option A). The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers relay in the otic ganglion before reaching the parotid gland, which is also true (option B). The sympathetic fibers are vasomotor, meaning they control the diameter of the blood vessels in the gland, which is true (option D). However, the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers originate from the superior salivatory nucleus, not the inferior petrosal nucleus (option C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
