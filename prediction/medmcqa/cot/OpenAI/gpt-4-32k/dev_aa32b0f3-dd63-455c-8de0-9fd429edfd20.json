    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old girl with absent thelarche, meaning she has not developed breasts, a key secondary sexual characteristic in females. Despite this, she has a uterus. Her high FSH levels indicate that her body is trying to stimulate the ovaries to produce estrogen, but this is not happening. The XY karyotype is typically associated with males, but she has female physical characteristics. This suggests a disorder of sex development. Gonadal dysgenesis is a condition where the gonads (ovaries or testes) have not properly developed, which fits with the high FSH levels and absent thelarche. Kallman syndrome is characterized by delayed or absent puberty and an impaired sense of smell, which is not mentioned in the case. Androgen insensitivity syndrome also presents with a female phenotype in an XY individual, but typically the individual would have normal breast development and no uterus. Adrenal hyperplasia does not fit with the symptoms and signs presented.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Gonadal dysgenesis\"}"
