    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A pulpotomy is a dental procedure that is used to try to save a decayed, infected or damaged tooth. It involves removing the pulp from the crown portion of a tooth and filling it with a suitable material. The purpose of a pulpotomy is not to prevent tooth fracture, so option A is incorrect. It is also not primarily used to form a hard base to support restoration, so option C is incorrect. While a pulpotomy can help minimize infection, its main purpose is not to minimize infection but to preserve the vitality of the tooth, so option D is also not the best answer. The main purpose of a pulpotomy in a young permanent tooth is to induce root formation, so option B is the most accurate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
