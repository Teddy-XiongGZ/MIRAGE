    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Crescendo angina is a type of angina where the symptoms become more severe and frequent over time. It is not stable angina, because stable angina has predictable triggers and relief patterns. It is not heart failure, because heart failure is a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It is not myocardial infarction (MI), because MI is a complete blockage of blood flow to a part of the heart causing part of the heart muscle to be damaged or die. Therefore, crescendo angina is a type of unstable angina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
