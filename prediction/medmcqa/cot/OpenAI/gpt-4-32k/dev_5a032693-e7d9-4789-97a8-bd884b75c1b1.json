    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GPCR stands for G protein-coupled receptors. These are a large family of receptors that respond to a variety of stimuli and can activate several different signaling pathways. The muscarinic M2 receptor, dopamine D2 receptor, and serotonin 5 HT1 receptor are all known to act through the opening of potassium channels. However, the angiotensin 1 receptor primarily acts through the activation of phospholipase C, not the opening of potassium channels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Angiotensin 1 receptor\"}"
