    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel rods, also known as enamel prisms, are tightly packed microscopic units that make up enamel, the hard outer covering of teeth. They are indeed perpendicular to the tooth surface and are parallel to each other. The diameter of enamel rods is not 30 micrometers at the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ); it's much smaller. However, the diameter of an enamel rod is also not as small as 5 micrometers at the DEJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
