    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate is a step in the glycolysis pathway. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase. The term 'isomerase' indicates that this enzyme catalyzes the rearrangement of a molecule, or isomerization. Therefore, this reaction is an example of isomerization, not phosphate transfer, dehydration, or aldol cleavage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
