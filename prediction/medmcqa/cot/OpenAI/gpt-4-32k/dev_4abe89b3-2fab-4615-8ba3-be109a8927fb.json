    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular arch is the lower jaw. When there is an arch size discrepancy, it means that there is not enough space for all the teeth to fit properly. The teeth that are most likely to be displaced are the ones that erupt last, because by the time they come in, the other teeth have already taken up most of the space. The last tooth to erupt in the mandibular arch is the second molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Second molar\"}"
