    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intracoronal bleaching is a procedure used to lighten the color of a tooth that has darkened after root canal treatment. After this procedure, it is recommended to wait for a period of time before placing a composite restoration. This is because the bleaching agent used (usually hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide) can interfere with the bonding of the composite to the tooth structure. Treating with catalase or H2O2 is not typically done after bleaching. Therefore, waiting for a certain period is the most appropriate step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
