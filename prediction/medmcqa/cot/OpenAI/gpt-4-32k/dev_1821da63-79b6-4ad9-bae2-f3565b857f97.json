    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemorrhagic shock is a severe type of shock that occurs when a person loses more than 20% (one fifth) of their body's blood or fluid supply. This severe fluid loss makes it impossible for the heart to pump a sufficient amount of blood to the body, leading to hypotension. Therefore, hypotension in hemorrhagic shock does not occur at a blood loss of 10%-15%, but it's also not as high as more than 40%. The range should be somewhere in between.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 30% - 40%\"}"
