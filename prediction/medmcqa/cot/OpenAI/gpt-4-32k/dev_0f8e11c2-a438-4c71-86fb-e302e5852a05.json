    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects bone growth and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that an individual only needs one copy of the affected gene to have the disorder. If both parents have achondroplasia, they each have one affected gene and one normal gene. When they have a child, there are four possible combinations of the genes the child could inherit: two normal genes (unaffected), one normal gene and one affected gene (affected), one affected gene and one normal gene (also affected), and two affected genes (severely affected, usually lethal). Therefore, the chance of having an unaffected baby (two normal genes) is 1 in 4, or 25%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
