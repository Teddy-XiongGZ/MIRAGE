    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The left ureter is a structure in the urinary system that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. It is located in the retroperitoneal space and has several structures in close proximity. The mesentery of the sigmoid colon (A) is located in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, which is where the left ureter also passes. The bifurcation of the common iliac artery (B) is also in close proximity to the left ureter. The gonadal vessels (D) are also in close relation to the ureter as they cross it. However, the quadratus lumborum (C) is a muscle of the posterior abdominal wall and is not in direct relation to the left ureter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
