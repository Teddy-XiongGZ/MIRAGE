    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ultrasound findings described in the question are characteristic of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. This condition is characterized by hyperplastic changes in the gallbladder wall that lead to the formation of intramural diverticula. These diverticula, also known as Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, can be filled with bile, which can cause the appearance of hyperechoic nodules and comet tail artifacts on ultrasound. Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder typically presents with a mass lesion, not diffuse wall thickening. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare form of chronic cholecystitis characterized by the presence of lipid-laden macrophages, not hyperechoic nodules. Cholesterol crystals would not cause diffuse wall thickening.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
