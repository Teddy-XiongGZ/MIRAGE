    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Increased intracranial pressure can cause a variety of symptoms. Headache is a common symptom, as the pressure can cause pain in the head. Nausea and vomiting can also occur, as the pressure can affect the brain's vomiting center. Somnolence, or excessive sleepiness, can also be a symptom, as the pressure can affect the brain's sleep-wake cycle.
