    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dengue shock syndrome is a severe form of dengue fever. It is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure, leading to shock. Symptoms include hepatomegaly, or an enlarged liver, which is a common symptom of many viral infections, including dengue. Pleural effusion, or fluid around the lungs, can also occur due to the body's inflammatory response to the virus. Thrombocytopenia, or a low platelet count, is another common symptom of dengue, as the virus can affect the body's ability to produce platelets. However, decreased haemoglobin is not a typical symptom of dengue shock syndrome. While dengue can cause a decrease in red blood cells, this is usually due to haemorrhage rather than a decrease in haemoglobin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
