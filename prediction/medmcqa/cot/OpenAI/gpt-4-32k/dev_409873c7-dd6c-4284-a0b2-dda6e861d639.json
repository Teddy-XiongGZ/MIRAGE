    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Staphylococcus food poisoning is caused by the ingestion of food contaminated with enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The optimum temperature for toxin production is indeed 37 degrees Celsius (Choice A). The toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus are heat-stable and cannot be destroyed by boiling for 30 minutes (Choice C). The incubation period for Staphylococcus food poisoning is typically short, ranging from 1 to 6 hours (Choice D). However, the toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus are not intradietic, meaning they do not cause intestinal symptoms by acting within the diet (Choice B). Instead, they cause symptoms by acting directly on the gastrointestinal tract after being ingested.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
