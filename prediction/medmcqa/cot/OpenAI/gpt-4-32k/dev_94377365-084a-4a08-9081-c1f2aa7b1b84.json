    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Restriction endonucleases, also known as restriction enzymes, are proteins that cut DNA at specific sequences. The sequence at which a particular restriction enzyme will cut is known as its recognition sequence. The recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme HindIII, for example, is AAGCTT. Therefore, the restriction endonuclease would cut at this sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
