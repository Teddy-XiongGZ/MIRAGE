    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel rods, also known as enamel prisms, are tightly packed microscopic units that make up enamel, the hard outer covering of teeth. They are composed of hydroxyapatite crystals. The orientation of these crystals within the enamel rods is not uniform. However, the orientation is not as specific as 0 degrees in the center or 45 degrees at the periphery. The orientation of the crystals can change throughout the rod and is not fixed at a certain degree.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None\"}"
