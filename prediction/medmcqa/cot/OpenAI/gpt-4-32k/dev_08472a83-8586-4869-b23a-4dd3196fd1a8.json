    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A symphyseal fracture refers to a fracture of the pubic symphysis, which is the midline cartilaginous joint uniting the superior rami of the left and right pubic bones. When a lag screw is used for fixation, it is designed to compress the fracture fragments together, thereby promoting healing. This is known as load sharing, where the load is shared between the implant and the bone. Load bearing refers to the implant bearing the entire load, which is not the case with lag screw fixation. Adaptation osteosynthesis and compression osteosynthesis are not directly related to the concept of load sharing or bearing in the context of lag screw fixation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Load sharing\"}"
