    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Doctrine of Borrowed Servant is a legal principle that states a person who is controlling or directing the employee has greater liability than the person who is paying the employee. So, let's analyze the options. Option A is true because the hospital administration is responsible for the actions of interns and trainees. Option B is also true because a nurse assisting a surgery is under the control of the surgeon, hence a borrowed servant of the hospital. Option D is true because the physician is responsible for the acts of the orderlies and nursing staff done by his orders. However, option C is not true because a doctor assisting a surgeon for a fee in OT is not a borrowed servant. He is an independent contractor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
