    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Central wrapping is a term used to describe the wrapping of afferent nerve fibers around the central part of a muscle spindle. This is not done by the Golgi tendon, which is involved in proprioception, or by Type 2 fibers, which are a type of muscle fiber. Flower spray endings are secondary sensory endings in muscle spindles that respond to the rate and degree of muscle stretch, but they do not perform central wrapping. The annulospiral endings, also known as primary sensory endings, wrap around the central part of intrafusal muscle fibers in the muscle spindle, providing information about the degree and rate of change of muscle length.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Annulospiral ending\"}"
