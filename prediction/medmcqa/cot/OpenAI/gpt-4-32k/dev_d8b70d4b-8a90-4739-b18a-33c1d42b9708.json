    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The proportion of false positive results among those who test positive is also known as the false discovery rate. This rate is influenced by the prevalence of the disease in the population. If the prevalence of the disease is higher in a population, then the proportion of false positives among those who test positive is likely to be lower because there are more true positives. Therefore, if the proportion of false positives is lower in population A, it suggests that the prevalence of the disease is higher in population A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
