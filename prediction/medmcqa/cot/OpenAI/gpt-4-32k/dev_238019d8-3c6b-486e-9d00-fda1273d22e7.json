    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's consider the age of the child, which is 13 months. At this age, the child should have already received the BCG vaccine, so option B is not correct. The child should also have received the 3 doses of OPV and IPV, and the 3 doses of Pentavalent vaccine, which includes Hepatitis B, so option D is not correct. The child should also have received the first dose of the measles vaccine, but not the second one yet, as the second dose is usually given at 15-18 months of age. Therefore, option C is not correct. So, the correct answer should be option A, which includes the 3 doses of OPV, 1 dose of IPV, 3 doses of Pentavalent, and 1 dose of measles vaccine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
