    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The masticatory space is a fascial space of the head and neck. It is a potential space that can be created by a pathological process, usually by infection. The masticatory space includes the submasseteric space, the pterygomandibular space, and the temporal space. These spaces are closely related to the mandible and the muscles of mastication. Therefore, an infection in these areas is most likely to be associated with a dental source, particularly the mandibular molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mandibular molar\"}"
