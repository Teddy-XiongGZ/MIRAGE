    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Guthrie test is used to screen for Phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme Phenylalanine hydroxylase. This leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, which can cause mental retardation if not treated early. The excess phenylalanine is converted to phenylketones, which can be detected in the urine, hence the statement 'Phenyl acetate positive in urine' is true. However, the statement 'White patch of hair due to tryptophan deficiency' is not related to PKU. Tryptophan deficiency can lead to a condition called albinism, which is characterized by white patches of hair, but this is not associated with PKU.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
