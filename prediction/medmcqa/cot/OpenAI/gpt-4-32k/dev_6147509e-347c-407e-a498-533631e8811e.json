    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, I need to consider which of these vaccines are newly introduced. The Rota virus vaccine was introduced in 2006, so it's not new. The Influenza vaccine is updated annually to match circulating strains, but the concept of an Influenza vaccine is not new. The Dengue vaccine was first licensed in 2015, so it can be considered relatively new. The Malaria vaccine was recommended by WHO for broader use in 2021, so it's also new. Therefore, the vaccine that is not newly introduced is the Influenza vaccine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
