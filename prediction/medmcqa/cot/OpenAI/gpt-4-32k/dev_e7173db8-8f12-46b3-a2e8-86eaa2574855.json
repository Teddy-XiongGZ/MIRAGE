    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ECG findings of a short PR interval and delta wave are indicative of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. This is a condition in which there is an extra electrical pathway in the heart, leading to episodes of rapid heart rate. Holter monitoring (Option A) can be useful in documenting the occurrence of these episodes. Treadmill stress test (Option B) can provoke the symptoms and help in diagnosis. Beta blockers (Option C) are often used to control the heart rate in patients with WPW syndrome. Reassurance (Option D) is generally not effective as this is a condition that requires medical intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
