    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to an enzyme at a site other than the active site, which changes the shape of the enzyme and prevents it from binding to its substrate. This results in a decrease in the maximum rate of reaction (Vmax), as the enzyme is less able to convert substrate into product. However, non-competitive inhibitors do not affect the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, so the Michaelis constant (Km) remains the same.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Decrease in Vmax\"}"
