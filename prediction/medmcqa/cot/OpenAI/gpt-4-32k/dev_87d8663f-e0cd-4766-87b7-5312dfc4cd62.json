    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is a measure of how much a material expands or contracts given a change in temperature. If the CTE of ceramic is much lower than that of metal, it means that the ceramic will expand and contract less than the metal when the temperature changes. This difference in expansion and contraction can put stress on the bond between the ceramic and the metal, potentially leading to failure. This would not be a cohesive failure of the ceramic or metal, as those would involve the materials themselves failing, not the bond. Therefore, the failure would be either adhesive or cohesive of the metal-ceramic bond. However, a cohesive failure of the bond would mean that the bond itself breaks, while an adhesive failure would mean that the bond detaches from one of the materials. Given that the ceramic has a lower CTE, it is less likely to detach from the bond, so the failure would most likely be adhesive of the metal-ceramic bond.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
