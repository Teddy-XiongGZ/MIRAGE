    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fracture of gold restoration can depend on several factors. The design of the restoration can play a role, as certain designs may be more prone to fracture than others. The type of alloy used can also influence the likelihood of fracture, as some alloys may be stronger or more durable than others. Finally, the ratio of noble metal to base metal can also affect the strength and durability of the restoration. Therefore, all of these factors can potentially influence the likelihood of a gold restoration fracturing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. All of above\"}"
