    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anatomical dead space refers to the portion of the respiratory system where air is present but no gas exchange occurs. This includes the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. To measure this, we need a method that can differentiate between areas of the lungs where gas exchange occurs and where it does not. Bohler's method is used for measuring the angle of the calcaneus, not for lung measurements. Spirometry measures the volume of air inspired and expired by the lungs but it does not differentiate between areas of gas exchange and dead space. The Xenon dilution technique is used to measure functional residual capacity, not dead space. The single breath nitrogen test, however, is used to measure dead space in the lungs. During this test, the subject takes a single breath of 100% oxygen. The concentration of nitrogen in the exhaled air is then measured. Since nitrogen is not absorbed in the lungs, the nitrogen concentration in the exhaled air reflects the amount of air that was in the anatomical dead space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
