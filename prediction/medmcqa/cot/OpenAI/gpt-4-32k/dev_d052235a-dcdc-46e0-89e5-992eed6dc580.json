    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Beta thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. In people with beta thalassemia, low levels of hemoglobin lead to a lack of oxygen in many parts of the body. As a result, the red blood cells in beta thalassemia are typically smaller (microcytic) and have less color (hypochromic) due to the reduced amount of hemoglobin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Microcytic and hypochromic\"}"
