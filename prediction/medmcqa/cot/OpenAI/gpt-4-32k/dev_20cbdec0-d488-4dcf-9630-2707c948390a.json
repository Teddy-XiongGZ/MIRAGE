    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The volume of distribution of a drug refers to the degree to which a drug is distributed in the body. If a drug has a low volume of distribution, it means that the drug is not widely distributed in the body and is mostly confined to the blood plasma. This does not necessarily mean that the drug has low bioavailability or low absorption, as these terms refer to the amount of drug that reaches systemic circulation and the rate at which a drug enters the body, respectively. It also does not mean that the drug is not metabolized in the body. Therefore, a low volume of distribution means that the drug does not accumulate in tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
