    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ureter is a tube that carries urine from the kidneys to the bladder. It is located close to the uterus and can be injured during procedures involving the uterus. A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus. There are different types of hysterectomy: vaginal, Weheim's, and laparoscopic abdominal. The risk of ureter injury is highest in procedures where the surgical field is limited and the ureter's anatomical relationship to the uterus is not clearly visualized. In a vaginal hysterectomy, the surgeon operates through the vagina, which provides limited visibility and access compared to abdominal procedures. Therefore, the risk of ureter injury is highest in vaginal hysterectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
