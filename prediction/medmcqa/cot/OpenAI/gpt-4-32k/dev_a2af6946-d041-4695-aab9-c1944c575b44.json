    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a genome editing tool. It works by making a cut at a specific location in the DNA. After the cut, the cell's own repair machinery is used to add or delete pieces of genetic material, or to make changes to the DNA by replacing an existing segment with a customized DNA sequence. The two major repair mechanisms are non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology directed repair (HDR). NHEJ is an error-prone process that often results in insertions or deletions, which can disrupt the function of genes. HDR, on the other hand, is a high-fidelity process that uses a homologous DNA sequence as a template for repair. Therefore, both A and B are correct, but A is more commonly associated with the CRISPR-Cas9 system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
