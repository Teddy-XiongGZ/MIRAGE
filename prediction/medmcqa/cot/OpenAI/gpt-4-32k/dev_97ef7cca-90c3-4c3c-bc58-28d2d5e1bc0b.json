    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic infections are caused by bacteria that can survive and grow in environments with little or no oxygen. Staphylococcus aureus, S. albus, and Streptococci are all aerobic bacteria, meaning they require oxygen to grow. On the other hand, Bacteroids are anaerobic bacteria, which means they can grow in environments with little or no oxygen, making them the most likely to be involved in anaerobic infections of the head and neck region.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
