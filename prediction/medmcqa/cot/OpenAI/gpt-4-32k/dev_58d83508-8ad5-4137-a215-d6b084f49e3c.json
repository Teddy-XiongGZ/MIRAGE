    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bone sounding is a method used to determine the thickness of the gums and underlying bone. It is not performed by RVG or radiovisiography, as these are imaging techniques used to visualize the internal structures of the body, not to physically measure them. CBCT, or Cone Beam Computed Tomography, is also an imaging technique, used to create 3D images of the dental and maxillofacial region. Probing, on the other hand, is a physical method used to measure the depth of periodontal pockets, and can also be used to measure the thickness of the gums and underlying bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
