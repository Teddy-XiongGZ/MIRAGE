    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingival recession refers to the retraction of the gum tissue, exposing more of the tooth or the tooth's root. Gutta percha is a material used in endodontic treatment to fill the root canal space. The trimming of gutta percha should be done in a way that it doesn't interfere with the sealing of the coronal area and doesn't cause any irritation to the exposed root due to gingival recession. The ACJ, or amelocemental junction, is the line where the enamel, which covers the crown of the tooth, and cementum, which covers the root, meet. Trimming the gutta percha 1 mm below the ACJ would ensure that it is adequately sealed within the root canal and doesn't interfere with the gingival recession area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 1 mm below the ACJ\"}"
