    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystinuria is a condition characterized by the buildup of the amino acid cystine, a component of protein, in the kidneys and bladder. As the kidneys filter the blood, they reabsorb needed nutrients and excrete the rest in urine. In people with cystinuria, the kidneys are unable to reabsorb cystine, so it passes into the urine. In the urine, cystine can form crystals that can build up into stones. Therefore, it is not characterized by generalized aminoaciduria or systemic acidosis. It also does not lead to the deposition of cystine crystals in renal tubular cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Recurrent urinary caliculi\"}"
