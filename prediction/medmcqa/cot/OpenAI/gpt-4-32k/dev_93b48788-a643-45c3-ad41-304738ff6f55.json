    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"While all of the options can contribute to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the best indicator among these is the LDL/HDL ratio. LDL cholesterol, often referred to as 'bad cholesterol', can build up in the arteries and lead to heart disease. HDL cholesterol, or 'good cholesterol', helps remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Therefore, a high LDL/HDL ratio indicates a higher risk of heart disease. A high LDL cholesterol level alone can also indicate a risk, but it doesn't provide as complete a picture as the ratio. Salt intake can contribute to high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease, but it's not as direct an indicator as the LDL/HDL ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. LDL/HDL ratio\"}"
