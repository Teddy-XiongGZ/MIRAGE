    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Orthophosphoric acid is commonly used in orthodontics to etch enamel before bracket placement. The etching process creates micro-porosities on the enamel surface for better adhesion of the bracket. The typical etching time is about 30 seconds. The depth of etching is usually in the range of micrometers, but not too deep as to cause damage to the enamel. Therefore, the etching depth should be relatively small.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 10 \u03bcm \u2014 20 \u03bcm\"}"
