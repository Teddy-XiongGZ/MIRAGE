    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontitis is a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue and destroys the bone that supports your teeth. It's often the result of poor oral hygiene. The bacteria involved in periodontitis produce enzymes that break down the periodontal fibres. Collagenase is an enzyme that breaks down collagen, which is a major component of the periodontal fibres. Hyaluronidase and coagulase are enzymes produced by bacteria, but they are not specifically involved in the breakdown of periodontal fibres. Hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid, a component of the extracellular matrix, and coagulase is involved in blood clotting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Collagenase\"}"
