    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Looseness in a Removable Partial Denture (RPD) can be due to several factors. Defective occlusal balancing (option A) could cause looseness, but it would also cause other symptoms like discomfort and difficulty chewing, not just looseness. A passive clasp on the abutment (option B) could indeed cause looseness, as the clasp is what helps secure the RPD in place. A thin flange (option C) could also cause looseness, but it would likely also cause discomfort and possibly even damage to the gums. Insufficient overlap on posterior teeth (option D) would not necessarily cause looseness, but rather a poor fit and difficulty chewing. Therefore, the most likely cause of looseness in a recently delivered RPD is a passive clasp on the abutment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
