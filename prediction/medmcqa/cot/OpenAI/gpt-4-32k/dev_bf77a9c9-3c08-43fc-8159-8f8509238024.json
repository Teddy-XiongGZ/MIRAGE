    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Genomic imprinting is a process by which genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. It is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone modification. Acetylation is a process that primarily affects histones and not the DNA itself. Phosphorylation and deamination are not directly involved in genomic imprinting. Therefore, the correct answer is methylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
