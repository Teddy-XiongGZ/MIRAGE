    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tachycardia, or a rapid heart rate, is a common response to shock. When a patient is in shock, their body is not getting enough blood flow, which can lead to damage of the body's organs. The body responds to this lack of blood flow by increasing the heart rate in an attempt to improve blood circulation. This is a response to hypotension, or low blood pressure, which is a common symptom of shock. Vasoconstriction, CNS anoxia, and anxiety can also cause tachycardia, but in the context of shock, the most direct cause is hypotension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hypotension\"}"
