    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The chest wall and lung recoil are balanced at a specific volume in the respiratory cycle. This is not the minute volume, which is the total volume of air breathed in one minute. It's also not the total lung capacity (TLC), which is the maximum volume of air the lungs can hold. The residual volume is the amount of air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation, so it's not the point of balance either. The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a normal exhalation, when the forces of the lungs and chest wall are in equilibrium. Therefore, the chest wall and lung recoil are balanced at FRC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
