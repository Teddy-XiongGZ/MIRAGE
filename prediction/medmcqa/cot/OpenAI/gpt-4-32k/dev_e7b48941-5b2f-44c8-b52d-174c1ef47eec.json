It is important in natural dentition to prevent excessive wear and tear, and in removable partial dentures (RPDs), especially distal extension RPDs, to ensure stability and prevent dislodgement. However, in complete dentures, non-working contact is not necessary because there are no natural teeth to protect from wear and tear, and the denture is designed to distribute forces evenly across the entire dental arch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
