    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antigenic drift is a mechanism for variation in viruses that involves the accumulation of mutations within the genes that code for antibody-binding sites. This is not exclusive to influenza virus type A, so option A is incorrect. It is not a result of frameshift mutation, but rather point mutations, so option B is incorrect. Antigenic drift mostly affects the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins, not the matrix protein, so options C and D are incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
