    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rh isoimmunization is a condition that occurs when a pregnant woman with Rh-negative blood is exposed to Rh-positive blood, leading to the mother developing antibodies against the Rh antigen. These antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells, leading to hemolytic disease of the newborn. The decision to perform an exchange transfusion is based on the severity of the baby's anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Cord blood hemoglobin less than 10 g% indicates severe anemia, and cord bilirubin more than 5 mg indicates severe hyperbilirubinemia. Both of these conditions can be indications for exchange transfusion. The history of a previous sibling being affected can increase the risk of Rh isoimmunization, but it is not a direct indication for exchange transfusion. Therefore, the answer is not 'all of these'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
