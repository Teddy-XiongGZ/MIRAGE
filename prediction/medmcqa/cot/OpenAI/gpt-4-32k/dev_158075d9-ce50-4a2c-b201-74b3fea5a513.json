    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biliary atresia is a condition in infants in which the bile ducts outside and inside the liver are scarred and blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver. The first step in diagnosing biliary atresia is usually an ultrasound (USG). It can show whether the gallbladder is present and whether there is a blockage in the bile ducts. However, it cannot definitively diagnose biliary atresia. Hepatic scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine test that can show whether bile is reaching the intestine. ERCP is an invasive procedure and is not typically used in infants. CT scan is not the first choice for diagnosing biliary atresia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. USG\"}"
