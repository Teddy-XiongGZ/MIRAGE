    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days. The markers of AKI include Cystatin C, N-gal, and Kim-1. Cystatin C is a small protein that is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys and its level in the blood can indicate how well the kidneys are working. N-gal and Kim-1 are also proteins that are released into the blood when there is kidney damage. However, Micro RNA-122 is not a marker of AKI. It is a biomarker for liver injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }"
