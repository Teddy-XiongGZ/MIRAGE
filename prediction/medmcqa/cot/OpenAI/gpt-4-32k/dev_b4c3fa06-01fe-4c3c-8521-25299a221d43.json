    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tidal volume is the amount of air that moves in or out of the lungs with each respiratory cycle. It can give us some information about breathing but not the whole picture. Respiratory rate is the number of breaths a person takes per minute. It is a basic measure of breathing but does not provide information about the quality of each breath. Alveolar ventilation refers to the amount of air that reaches the alveoli and is available for gas exchange per minute. It is a more comprehensive measure of breathing as it takes into account both the volume of air and the frequency of breathing. FEV 1 is the forced expiratory volume in the first second, which is a measure used in diagnosing and monitoring lung diseases, but it is not a direct measure of breathing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Alveolar ventilation\"}"
