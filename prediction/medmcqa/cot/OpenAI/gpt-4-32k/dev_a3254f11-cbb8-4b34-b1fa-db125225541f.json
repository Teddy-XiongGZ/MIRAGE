    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amphotericin B is known to cause renal potassium wasting, leading to hypokalemia. The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L. This patient's potassium level is 2.3 mEq/L, which is significantly below the normal range. Severe hypokalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level of less than 2.5 mEq/L. This patient's potassium level is close to this threshold, indicating a need for aggressive potassium supplementation. The usual potassium replacement for severe hypokalemia is 40-100 mEq/day. However, in the case of ongoing losses (as with amphotericin B), higher doses may be required.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 120-160 mEq over 24 hours\"}"
