    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure, so it's not the answer. Perfusion pressure is the pressure gradient that drives blood flow to the tissues, so it's not the answer either. Critical closing pressure is the arterial pressure at which a blood vessel collapses and becomes occluded, so it's not the answer. Mean circulatory filling pressure is the pressure in the vascular system when there is no blood flow, so it's the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
