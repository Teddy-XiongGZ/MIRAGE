    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital condition characterized by a narrowing of the aorta. In postductal coarctation, the narrowing occurs after the aortic arch, affecting the blood flow to the lower body. The body compensates for this by rerouting blood through collateral circulation. The most common collateral pathways involve the intercostal arteries, which are branches of the thoracic aorta, and the internal thoracic (mammary) arteries, which give rise to the superior epigastric arteries. Therefore, the blood flow to the lower limb is maintained through these arteries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Intercostal arteries and superior epigastric artery\"}"
