    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vitamin D metabolism involves two hydroxylation steps. The first step, 25-alpha hydroxylation, occurs in the liver, which is stated in option A. The second step, 1-alpha hydroxylation, occurs in the kidneys, which is stated in option B. The daily requirement of Vitamin D in the absence of sunlight is indeed around 400-800 IU/day, so option C is slightly off but within the acceptable range. Williams syndrome, however, is characterized by cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and learning challenges, but not specifically obesity, mental retardation, or precocious puberty. Therefore, option D seems to be the incorrect statement about Vitamin D metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
