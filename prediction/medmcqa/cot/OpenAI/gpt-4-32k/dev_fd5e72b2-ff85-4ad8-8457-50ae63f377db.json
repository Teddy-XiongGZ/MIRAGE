    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises from cells originating in the 'mantle zone.' Cyclin D1 is a protein that is usually overexpressed in mantle cell lymphoma, but in some cases, it may not be present. In such cases, other markers are needed for diagnosis. SOX11 is a transcription factor that is highly specific for mantle cell lymphoma and can be used as a marker, especially in Cyclin D1 negative cases. Annexin V, MYD88, and ITRA I are not specifically associated with mantle cell lymphoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. SOX 11\"}"
