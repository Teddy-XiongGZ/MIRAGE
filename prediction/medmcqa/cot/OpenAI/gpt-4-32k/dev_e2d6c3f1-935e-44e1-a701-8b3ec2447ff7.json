    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, the body undergoes several physiological changes to support the growing fetus. These include an increase in stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart in one contraction. Cardiac output, which is the volume of blood the heart pumps per minute, also increases. Intravascular volume, or the volume of blood in the circulatory system, also increases to supply the fetus with nutrients. However, peripheral resistance, which is the resistance of the arteries to blood flow, decreases during pregnancy to accommodate the increased blood volume and flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Increased peripheral resistance\"}"
