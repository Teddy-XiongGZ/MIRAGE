    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GTR stands for Guided Tissue Regeneration. It is a surgical procedure used in periodontal therapy to direct the growth of new bone and gingival connective tissue at sites having bone defects. The barrier membrane in GTR is used to prevent the faster-growing epithelial cells from populating the wound area, thus allowing the slower-growing bone and connective tissue cells to populate the area. Therefore, the role of the barrier membrane in GTR is not to help overall healing, stop bleeding, or prevent the underlying tissues from infection, but to prevent epithelial migration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
