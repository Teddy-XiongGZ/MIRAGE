    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The occipitoposterior position refers to the position of the baby's head during labor, where the back of the baby's head (occiput) is towards the mother's posterior (back). This position can make labor more difficult. Maternal obesity and multiparity (having given birth two or more times) can contribute to labor complications, but they are not the most common causes of the occipitoposterior position. An android pelvis, which is a male-like pelvis in a female, can also make labor more difficult, but it is not the most common cause of the occipitoposterior position. The most common cause of the occipitoposterior position is deflexion of the fetal head, where the baby's head is not fully flexed towards its chest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Deflexion of fetal head\"}"
