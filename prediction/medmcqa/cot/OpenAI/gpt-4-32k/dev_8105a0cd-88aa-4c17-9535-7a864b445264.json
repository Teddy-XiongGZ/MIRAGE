    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gutta Percha is a material commonly used in endodontics, particularly in root canal treatments. It's important to sterilize it to prevent any infection. Hot salt sterilizer might not be effective enough. Chemical solutions could potentially degrade the material. Dry heat could also potentially alter the material. Autoclaving, however, is a common method of sterilization in dental practices and it uses steam under pressure to kill microorganisms, which should be effective for Gutta Percha without damaging it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Autoclaving\"}"
