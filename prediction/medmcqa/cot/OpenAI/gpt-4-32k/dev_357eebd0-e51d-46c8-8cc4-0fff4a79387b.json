    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx and helps to equalize pressure in the middle ear. Tympanometry is a test that measures the movement of the tympanic membrane, which can be affected by Eustachian tube function. VEMP is a test for vestibular function, not Eustachian tube function. Rhinomanometry measures nasal airflow and resistance, not directly related to Eustachian tube function. The Politzer test is an old method of inflating the middle ear by blowing air up the nose, which can assess Eustachian tube function, but it's not as accurate or commonly used as tympanometry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Tympanometry\"}"
