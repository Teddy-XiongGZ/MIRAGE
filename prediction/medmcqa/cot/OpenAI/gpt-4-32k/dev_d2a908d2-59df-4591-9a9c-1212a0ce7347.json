    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Jack-knife position refers to a position where the body is bent at the waist, similar to the position of a folding knife. This position can restrict the diaphragm's movement, which is essential for breathing. Wedging and Burking are not related to this position. Traumatic asphyxia is usually caused by a sudden and severe compression of the chest or upper abdomen. Positional asphyxia, on the other hand, occurs when someone's position prevents them from breathing adequately. Therefore, staying in the Jack-knife position for a long time could potentially lead to positional asphyxia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Positional asphyxia\"}"
