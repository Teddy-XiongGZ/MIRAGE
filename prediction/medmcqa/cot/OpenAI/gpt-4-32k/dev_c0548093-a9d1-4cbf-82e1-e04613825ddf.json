    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontitis is a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue and destroys the bone that supports your teeth. The primary cause of periodontitis is poor oral hygiene, which leads to plaque buildup on the teeth and gums. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that is constantly forming on our teeth. If not removed through daily brushing and flossing, plaque can build up and the bacteria can infect not only your gums and teeth, but eventually the gum tissue and bone that support the teeth. Calculus, trauma from occlusion, and food debris layer can contribute to the development of periodontitis, but they are not the primary initiators.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Dental plaque\"}"
