    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intraoral radiography is a type of dental imaging. High speed film requires less radiation exposure, thus decreasing patient radiation. Intensifying screens also reduce the amount of radiation needed to produce an image. Lead aprons are used to protect the patient from unnecessary radiation exposure. However, decreasing kVp (kilovoltage peak) would actually increase patient radiation because it would require a higher dose of radiation to produce the same quality of image.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
