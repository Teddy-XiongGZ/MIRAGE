    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The classification of gingival recession is based on the Miller's classification. Class I and II recessions are considered to be treatable with a predictable level of success, as they have no loss of interdental bone or soft tissue. Class III recession has some loss of interdental bone or soft tissue, but the prognosis for complete root coverage is only possible to a certain extent. Class IV recession, however, has severe bone or soft tissue loss and root coverage is not possible. Therefore, the placement of graft will be a failure in Class IV recession.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
