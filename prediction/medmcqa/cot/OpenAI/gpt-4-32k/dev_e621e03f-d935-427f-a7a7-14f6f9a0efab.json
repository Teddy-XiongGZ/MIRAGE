    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child was weaned from breast milk and given sugarcane juice, which is high in fructose. The symptoms of hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, hypophosphatemia, and reducing substances in urine are indicative of a disorder in fructose metabolism. Fructokinase deficiency would lead to fructosuria, which is not harmful. Glucose 6 Phosphatase deficiency would lead to glycogen storage disease type I, which is not consistent with the symptoms. Beta galactosidase deficiency would lead to a lysosomal storage disease, which is also not consistent with the symptoms. Aldolase B deficiency, however, would lead to hereditary fructose intolerance, which matches the symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Aldolase B\"}"
