    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Spring back refers to the ability of a material to return to its original shape after deformation. Superelastic NiTi wires, also known as Nitinol, are known for their superelasticity or shape memory properties, which means they can undergo large deformations and still return to their original shape. On the other hand, non-superelastic NiTi wires do not have this property to the same extent. Therefore, the spring back in bending would be greater for superelastic NiTi wires than non-superelastic NiTi wires.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
