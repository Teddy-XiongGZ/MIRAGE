It is defined by a straight line passing through two anatomical landmarks: the point at which the lower margin of the eye socket (the infraorbital rim), meets the upper margin of the external ear canal (the external auditory meatus), known as the 'porion', and the point at which the lower margin of the eye socket meets the upper margin of the external opening of the nose, known as the 'orbitale'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
