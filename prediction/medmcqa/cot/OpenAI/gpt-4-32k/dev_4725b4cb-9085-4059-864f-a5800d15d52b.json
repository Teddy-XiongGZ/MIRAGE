    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ability of a bur blade to describe a complete circle during rotation refers to how accurately the blade rotates around its central axis. This is not related to staticity, which refers to the state of being stationary, or symmetry, which refers to the balance of proportions. Run out is a term used to describe the deviation of a physical feature from its ideal position during rotation, which is not exactly what we are looking for. Concentricity, on the other hand, refers to the quality of having the same center or axis, which is exactly what we are looking for in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
