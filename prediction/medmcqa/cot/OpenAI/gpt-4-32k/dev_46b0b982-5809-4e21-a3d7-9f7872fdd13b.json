    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lateral shift, also known as Bennett's movement, is a term used in dentistry to describe the movement of the mandible to the side. This movement is primarily associated with the position of the teeth in the mouth. Faciolingual refers to the direction from the facial surface to the lingual surface of a tooth, while mesiodistal refers to the direction from the mesial (front) to the distal (back) of a tooth. Therefore, a lateral shift would influence both the faciolingual and mesiodistal positions of the teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Both of the above\"}"
