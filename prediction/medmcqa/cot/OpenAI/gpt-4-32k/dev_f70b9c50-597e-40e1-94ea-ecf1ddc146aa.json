    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bacterial meningitis is a serious infection that can be contagious. The bacteria that cause meningitis can be spread from person to person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions. Antibiotics can reduce the risk of spreading the disease to others. After starting antibiotics, a person with bacterial meningitis will usually stop being contagious within 24 hours. Therefore, isolation is typically recommended until 24 hours after antibiotics have been started. Waiting for cultures to become negative or for the antibiotics course to be complete is not necessary for preventing transmission. Also, the time of admission is not relevant to the contagiousness of the disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
