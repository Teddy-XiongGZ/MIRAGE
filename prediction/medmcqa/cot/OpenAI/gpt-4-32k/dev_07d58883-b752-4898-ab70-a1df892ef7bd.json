    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Rb gene, or Retinoblastoma protein, is a tumor suppressor protein that is dysfunctional in several major cancers. One of its functions is to prevent excessive cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression until a cell is ready to divide. It does this by binding to the E2F family of transcription factors, preventing them from activating genes required for the S phase of the cell cycle. When Rb is phosphorylated, it becomes inactive, allowing the cell cycle to progress. Therefore, if Rb gene phosphorylation is defective, it will not become inactive and the cell cycle will not progress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Cell cycle will stop at GI phase\"}"
