    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of failure to thrive, polyuria, and medullary nephrocalcinosis, along with the lab results showing metabolic alkalosis (high blood pH and normal bicarbonate), hypokalemia (low potassium), and hyponatremia (low sodium) suggest a renal tubular disorder. Distal renal tubular acidosis usually presents with metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis, so it's not the most likely diagnosis. Primary hyperaldosteronism typically causes hypertension, which is not mentioned in the case. Pseudohypoaldosteronism usually presents with hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia. Bartter syndrome, a disorder of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, is characterized by metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia, which matches the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bartter syndrome\"}"
