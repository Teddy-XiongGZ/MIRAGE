    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA) is a test that measures the electrical potentials generated by the neural elements of the auditory system. The wave 'V' in BERA is typically associated with the lateral lemniscus, which is a tract of axons in the brainstem that carries information about sound from the cochlear nucleus to various brainstem nuclei and ultimately the contralateral inferior colliculus of the midbrain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Lateral lemniscus\"}"
