    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lacrimation, or tear production, is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The greater petrosal nerve, a branch of the facial nerve, carries parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal gland, stimulating tear production. Therefore, damage to this nerve could affect lacrimation. The nasociliary nerve, anterior ethmoid nerve, and trigeminal nerve are not directly involved in tear production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Greater petrosal nerve\"}"
