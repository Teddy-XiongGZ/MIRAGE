    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An ABG, or arterial blood gas test, is a test that measures the acidity (pH) and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood from an artery. This test is used to check how well your lungs are able to move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. Let's go through the options one by one. Option A, the syringe should be loaded with 0.3 cc of heparin before performing the ABG. This is true because heparin is used to prevent clotting of the blood sample. Option B, normal pH, HCO3, and PCO2 levels may not indicate absence of an acid-base imbalance. This is also true because these values can be within the normal range in a condition of compensated acid-base imbalance. Option C, a different site should be tried if modified Allen's test is negative. This is true because a negative Allen's test indicates inadequate collateral circulation to the hand, which could lead to ischemia if the radial artery is punctured. Option D, radial artery is the preferred site. This is true because the radial artery is easily accessible and has less risk of complications compared to other sites.\", \"answer_choice\": \"All of the statements are true\"}"
