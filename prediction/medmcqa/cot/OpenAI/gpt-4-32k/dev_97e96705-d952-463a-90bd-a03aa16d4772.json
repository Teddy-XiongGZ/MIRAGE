    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optimal landmark for termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation in endodontic treatment is the apical constriction. This is the narrowest part of the root canal and is the ideal location for the apical stop. The cementodentinal junction is not a reliable landmark because it is not always clearly visible. The major diameter is not a suitable landmark because it is too far apically. Therefore, the second optimal landmark would be none of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of the above\"}"
