    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a method used in anesthesia to quickly provide general anesthesia while minimizing the risk of aspiration. Let's go through the options: A. Inducing agent and neuromuscular relaxant are administered together - this is true, as the goal of RSI is to quickly induce unconsciousness and paralysis to facilitate intubation. B. The patient is pre-oxygenated for 3 minutes before the procedure - this is also true, as pre-oxygenation helps to create an oxygen reserve and delay the onset of hypoxia during the procedure. C. Cricoid pressure has to be applied till the endotracheal tube has been secured with a cuff - this is true, as cricoid pressure is used to prevent aspiration during the procedure. D. Induction should be done with thiopentone sodium and succinylcholine for muscle relaxation - this is not necessarily true. While these drugs can be used, the choice of induction and muscle relaxant agents can vary depending on the patient's condition and the anesthesiologist's preference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
