    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fingerprinting (FINDER) involves recording prints of 8 fingers. This means that out of the 10 fingers we have, 2 are not recorded. The question asks which pair is excluded, so it must be a pair of the same finger on both hands. The thumb and little finger are often used in many activities and are quite distinct, so it's unlikely they would be excluded. The middle finger is also quite distinct. The ring finger, however, is less distinct and could potentially be more similar to other fingers, so it's possible it could be excluded.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Ring finger\"}"
