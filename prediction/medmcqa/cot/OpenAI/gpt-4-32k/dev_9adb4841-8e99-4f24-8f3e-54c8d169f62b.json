    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question seems to be referring to a lesion in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). This nerve innervates the superior rectus, inferior oblique, and medial rectus muscles of the eye. However, the superior oblique muscle is innervated by the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV), not the oculomotor nerve. Therefore, a lesion in the oculomotor nerve would not affect the superior oblique muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Superior oblique\"}"
