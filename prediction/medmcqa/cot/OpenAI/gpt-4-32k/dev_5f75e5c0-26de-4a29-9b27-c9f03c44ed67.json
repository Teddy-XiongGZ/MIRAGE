    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with palpitations and a fast pulse, which suggests a tachyarrhythmia. The low blood pressure indicates that the patient is hemodynamically unstable. The vagal maneuver and adenosine are first-line treatments for supraventricular tachycardia, but they have not been effective in this case. The next step in management should be to restore normal rhythm and stabilize the patient. Defibrillation is used for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which is not the case here. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug, but it may take some time to act. Cardioversion is a procedure that can quickly restore normal heart rhythm in emergency situations, especially when the patient is unstable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Cardioversion\"}"
