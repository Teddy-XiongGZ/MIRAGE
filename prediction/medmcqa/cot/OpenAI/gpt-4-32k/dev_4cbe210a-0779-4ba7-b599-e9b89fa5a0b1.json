    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a child with pustular lesions on the lower legs, and the culture from the lesion showed Gram-positive cocci that form hemolytic colonies on blood agar. This is suggestive of a Streptococcus species. Streptococcus species are divided into groups based on their cell wall antigens. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is a common cause of skin infections like pyoderma, especially in children. To differentiate between different Streptococcus species, we can use several tests. Optochin sensitivity is used to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, not group A Streptococcus. Catalase positivity is a characteristic of Staphylococcus species, not Streptococcus. Bile solubility is also used to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacitracin sensitivity, however, is a characteristic of group A Streptococcus, and a positive test would support the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pyoderma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Bacitracin sensitivity\"}"
