    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-infection in digital radiography/RVG can be prevented by using a barrier method. Autoclaving a cloth for each use (option A) is not practical and may not provide a complete barrier. Wiping with ethyl alcohol (option B) or cleaning with sodium hypochlorite (option C) may not be sufficient to prevent cross-contamination, especially if the sensor is not thoroughly cleaned. Covering the sensor with an impervious barrier (option D) is the most effective way to prevent cross-contamination as it provides a physical barrier between the sensor and the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
