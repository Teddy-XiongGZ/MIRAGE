    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alginate and agar-agar are both hydrocolloid impression materials used in dentistry. They do not share the property of gelation increasing with temperature increase, as alginate sets via a chemical reaction and agar-agar sets via cooling. The mixing time does not necessarily correlate with the setting time in both materials. Both materials can distort during removal, leading to deformation of the impression. However, neither material can be reused for fresh impressions due to the risk of cross-contamination and the fact that they undergo irreversible reactions during setting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
