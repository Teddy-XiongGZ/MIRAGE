    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An episiotomy is a surgical incision made in the perineum, the area between the vagina and anus, to enlarge the vaginal opening for childbirth. There are two types of episiotomies: midline and mediolateral. A midline episiotomy is a straight vertical incision and a mediolateral episiotomy is an incision made at an angle. The advantage of a mediolateral episiotomy over a midline episiotomy is that it has a lesser chance of extending into the anal sphincter and rectum, which can lead to long-term complications such as fecal incontinence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Less chance of extension\"}"
