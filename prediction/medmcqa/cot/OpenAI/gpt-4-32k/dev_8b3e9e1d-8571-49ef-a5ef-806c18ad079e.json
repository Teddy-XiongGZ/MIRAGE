    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Barbiturates are a class of drugs that act as central nervous system depressants. They are often used for anesthesia. Ultrashort acting barbiturates have a very rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect. Meprobamate is an anxiolytic drug, not a barbiturate. Pentobarbitone and Phenobarbitone are both barbiturates, but they are not ultrashort acting. Thiopentone, on the other hand, is an ultrashort acting barbiturate often used for induction of anesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Thiopentone\"}"
