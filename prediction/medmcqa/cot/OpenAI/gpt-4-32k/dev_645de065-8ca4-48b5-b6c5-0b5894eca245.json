    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Essential fatty acids are those that the body cannot synthesize and must be obtained from the diet. These include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Lenoleic acid is an omega-6 fatty acid and is indeed essential, but it is not the only one present in breast milk. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 fatty acid that is also essential and is particularly important for the development of the brain and retina in infants. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid and is not considered essential. EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) is also an omega-3 fatty acid, but it is not as crucial for infants as DHA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Docosahexanoic acid\"}"
