    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tramadol is a unique opioid analgesic as it has a dual mechanism of action. It works by binding to the mu-opioid receptors in the brain, like all opioids. However, it also inhibits the reuptake of two neurotransmitters: serotonin and norepinephrine. This dual action can help to increase the pain threshold and reduce the perception of pain. It does not have anticholinergic or antihistaminic properties, and it does not inhibit the reuptake of dopamine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
