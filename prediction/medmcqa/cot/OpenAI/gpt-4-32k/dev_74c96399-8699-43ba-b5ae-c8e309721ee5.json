    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. This excess growth hormone causes the bones and body tissues to enlarge over time. A large tongue (macroglossia) is a common feature of acromegaly. Micrognathia, or a smaller than normal jaw, is not typically associated with acromegaly. Instead, acromegaly is associated with prognathism, or an enlarged jaw. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is not a typical feature of acromegaly. Instead, acromegaly can cause insulin resistance and lead to hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. Crowded teeth can occur in acromegaly due to the enlargement of facial bones and tissues, but it's not as common as a large tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Large tongue\"}"
