    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about comparing the weights of two groups of newborns. The weights are a continuous variable, and the groups are independent of each other (one group's results don't affect the other's). The Chi square test and Fischer exact test are used for categorical data, not continuous data like weight. The Paired T-test is used for comparing two related groups, which is not the case here. Therefore, the Student's T-test, which is used for comparing the means of two independent groups, is the most appropriate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Student's T-test\"}"
