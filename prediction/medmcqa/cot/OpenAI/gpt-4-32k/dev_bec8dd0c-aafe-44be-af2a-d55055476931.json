    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the body surface area involved in burns, we use the 'Rule of Nines' in adults and the 'Lund and Browder Chart' in children. According to the Lund and Browder Chart, the body surface area of a 2-year-old child's head is 18%, each upper limb is 9%, and the front of the chest and abdomen is 18%. So, if the child has burns on the face, both upper limbs, and the front of the chest and abdomen, we add these percentages together: 18% (face) + 9% (right upper limb) + 9% (left upper limb) + 18% (front of chest and abdomen) = 54%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
