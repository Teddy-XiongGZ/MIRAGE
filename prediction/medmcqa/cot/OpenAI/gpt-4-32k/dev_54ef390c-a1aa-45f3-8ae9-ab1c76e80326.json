    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulpal necrosis is the death of the pulp tissue in the tooth, often due to bacterial infection. The rapid progression of bacteria resulting in pulpal necrosis can be influenced by several factors. Host resistance refers to the body's ability to fight off the infection, which can slow down the progression. Dentinal fluid flow and pulp vitality are related to the health and function of the tooth itself. However, the virulence of the bacteria, or their ability to cause disease, is the most important factor in how quickly the bacteria can cause damage. More virulent bacteria can cause more severe and rapid disease progression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Virulence of bacteria\"}"
