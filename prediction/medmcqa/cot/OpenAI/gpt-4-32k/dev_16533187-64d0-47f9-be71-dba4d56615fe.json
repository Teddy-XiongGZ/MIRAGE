    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child is premature and is presenting with respiratory difficulty, which is a common complication in preterm infants due to immature lungs. The most common cause is Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), which is due to surfactant deficiency. Surfactant is a substance that prevents the alveoli in the lungs from collapsing, allowing for efficient gas exchange. In this case, the child would benefit from surfactant replacement therapy. However, surfactant is usually given via an endotracheal tube, which means the child would also need to be ventilated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Surfactant and ventilation\"}"
