    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A placebo is a substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value. It is often used in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatments. Herbal medication with no known effect could be considered a placebo, but it's not the best example because it might have some unknown effects. Physiotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are actual treatments with known therapeutic effects. Sham surgery, on the other hand, is a procedure that mimics real surgery but does not have any therapeutic effect. It is often used in clinical trials as a control group to compare with actual surgery. Therefore, it is the best example of a placebo.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
