    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mesomerism is a concept in organic chemistry dealing with resonance, not color change. Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation, it is a form of luminescence. Refractive index is a measure of how much the speed of light (or other waves such as sound waves) is reduced inside the medium, it doesn't cause a substance to appear different under varying conditions of color. Metamerism, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in which the color of an object appears different under different lighting conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metamerism\"}"
