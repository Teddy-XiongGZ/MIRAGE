    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question describes a tooth with deep caries but no symptoms, and a radiopaque mass at the apex of the tooth. Radiopaque means that the mass is dense and does not allow x-rays to pass through, appearing white on the radiograph. Cementoma is a benign tumor of the cementum, which is the calcified substance covering the root of a tooth. However, it is usually not associated with caries. Chronic apical periodontitis and acute apical periodontitis are inflammatory conditions, usually associated with symptoms and not typically presenting as a radiopaque mass. Condensing osteitis, on the other hand, is a reaction to a low-grade infection, such as a deep caries, and presents as a radiopaque mass at the apex of the tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Condensing osteitis\"}"
