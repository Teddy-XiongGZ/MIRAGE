    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rhythm generation of inspiration is controlled by a group of neurons located in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. This group of neurons is known as the Pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex. The dorsal nucleus of vagus is involved in parasympathetic innervation, not in rhythm generation of inspiration. Ventral respiratory neurons are involved in expiration, not inspiration. The pneumotaxic center helps regulate the rate and pattern of breathing but is not directly responsible for the rhythm generation of inspiration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pre botzinger complex\"}"
