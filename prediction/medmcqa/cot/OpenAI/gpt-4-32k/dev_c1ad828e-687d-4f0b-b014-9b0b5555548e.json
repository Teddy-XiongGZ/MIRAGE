    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RVG, or RadioVisioGraphy, is a form of digital radiography. It does indeed reduce patient exposure to radiation by about 80%, so option A is true. It also provides instant imaging, making option B true as well. The digital nature of RVG makes it easy to store and retrieve images, so option C is also true. However, while the image quality of RVG is generally very good, it is not necessarily sharper than that produced by silver halide, which is used in traditional film-based radiography. Therefore, option D is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
