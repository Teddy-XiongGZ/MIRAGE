    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An intraoral dental X-ray film is indeed composed of a cellulose acetate base coated with a silver bromide emulsion, so option A is true. The film does have an embossed dot on it which should be orientated towards the source of X-rays, making option C true. The film is exposed by the direct action of X-rays on the emulsion, so option D is also true. However, the lead foil is not placed in front of the film, but behind it. The purpose of the lead foil is to shield the film from backscatter radiation, not to prevent overexposure, making option B the false statement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
