    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The average age for the eruption of the first tooth in infants is around 6 months, but it can vary widely. Some babies might get their first tooth as early as 3 months, while others might not get their first tooth until they are 1 year old or even later. Therefore, at 10 months, it's not necessarily a cause for concern if a baby hasn't yet had a tooth eruption. It's also important to note that radiographic examinations like OPG or PA skull view are not typically necessary for a baby of this age just because they haven't had a tooth eruption yet. A paediatric consultation could be considered, but it's not the first step in the treatment protocol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Wait and watch\"}"
