    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation and comminuted fracture is a severe injury. 'Bag of bones' & IMF (option A) is not a suitable treatment for this type of injury. Reconstruction plates & closure of fracture (option B) might be a part of the treatment, but it's not comprehensive enough. Immediate reconstruction & grafting (option C) is not advisable because the wound needs to be thoroughly cleaned first to prevent infection. Therefore, the best treatment would be initially debridement to clean the wound, then load bearing reconstruction plates to stabilize the fracture, and grafting in a secondary procedure to replace lost bone and tissue (option D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
