    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Addison's disease is a disorder that occurs when the body produces insufficient amounts of certain hormones produced by the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are composed of two parts: the cortex and the medulla. The cortex produces hormones that are vital to life, such as cortisol (which helps regulate metabolism and helps your body respond to stress) and aldosterone (which helps control blood pressure). The medulla, the inner part, isn't essential to life, but helps your body react to stress. Addison's disease pertains to the cortex, not the medulla, pancreas, or thyroid gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
