    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a thin, fibrous ligament that connects the cementum of a tooth with the alveolar bone. When a tooth loses its antagonist, it tends to over-erupt to try to find a new contact. This over-eruption can lead to a widening of the PDL space as the tooth moves away from the alveolar bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Widening of the PDL space\"}"
