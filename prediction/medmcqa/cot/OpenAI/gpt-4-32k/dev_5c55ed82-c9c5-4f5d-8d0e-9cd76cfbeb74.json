    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At 6 weeks of pregnancy, the most accurate and safe method to diagnose pregnancy would be a method that is non-invasive and provides clear evidence of the pregnancy. Doppler assessment of fetal cardiac activity is usually not used this early in pregnancy. Urinary Beta-hCG determination can confirm pregnancy but it does not provide information about the location or viability of the pregnancy. Per vaginal examination of uterine size corresponding to 6 weeks gestation is not the most accurate method as the size of the uterus can vary greatly among women. Therefore, the most accurate and safe method would be USG for fetal cardiac activity, which can confirm the presence and location of the pregnancy and also assess the viability of the fetus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
