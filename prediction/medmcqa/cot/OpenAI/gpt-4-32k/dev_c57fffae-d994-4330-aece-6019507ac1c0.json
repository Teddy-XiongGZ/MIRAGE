    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chromosomal mapping is the process of locating genes on a chromosome. Inheritance testing is used to determine whether a person is a carrier of a genetic disorder. Genotyping is the process of determining differences in the genetic make-up of an individual by examining the individual's DNA sequence. Karyotyping, on the other hand, is the process of pairing and ordering all the chromosomes of an organism, thus providing a genome-wide snapshot of an individual's chromosomes. It includes the analysis of the number, size, shape, and internal arrangement of the chromosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Karyotyping\"}"
