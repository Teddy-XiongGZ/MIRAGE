    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sweating is a physiological method of heat loss as it allows the body to cool down through evaporation. Vasodilation is another physiological method of heat loss as it increases blood flow to the skin surface, allowing heat to be lost to the environment. Peripheral vasoconstriction is also a physiological method, but it is used to conserve heat, not to lose it. It reduces blood flow to the skin surface, reducing heat loss. Posture is not a physiological method of heat loss. It can affect heat loss indirectly, for example by exposing more or less skin surface to the environment, but it is not a physiological method in itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
