    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH has a significant effect on the kidneys, where it decreases the reabsorption of phosphate, leading to increased phosphate excretion in the urine. Therefore, the decreased phosphate levels seen in hyperparathyroidism are not due to decreased intestinal phosphate absorption or increased calcium excretion, but rather due to the effect of PTH on the kidneys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Decreased renal phosphate absorption\"}"
