    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardiac pain is often referred to areas that are supplied by the same spinal segments as the heart. The heart is primarily innervated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers from the cervical and upper thoracic ganglia. The referred pain to the jaw is due to the overlapping of sensory pathways from the heart and the jaw in the central nervous system. The jaw is primarily innervated by the 5th cranial nerve, also known as the trigeminal nerve. The heart's sensory innervation can be traced back to the upper thoracic and lower cervical spinal cord segments, specifically the first thoracic nerve and the second and third cervical nerves.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 5th cranial nerve, second cervical nerve and first thoracic nerve\"}"
