    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that is often used in the treatment of septic shock. It works by constricting the blood vessels, which increases the blood pressure. Therefore, the best way to check the response to this drug would be to monitor the patient's blood pressure. The term 'mean arterial pressure' refers to the average pressure in a patient's arteries during one cardiac cycle. It is a better indicator of perfusion to vital organs than systolic blood pressure. Therefore, an increase in mean arterial pressure would indicate a positive response to the drug.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increase in mean aerial pressure\"}"
