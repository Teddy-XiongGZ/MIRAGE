    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Immunologically active cells are cells that play a role in the immune response. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell that produce antibodies, which are proteins that can recognize and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. MAST cells are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the immune response to pathogens and in allergic reactions. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are involved in the immune response to certain infections and to allergic reactions. Red blood cells (R.B.C s) are not involved in the immune response; their primary function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Therefore, all options except for R.B.C s are immunologically active cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A, B, C\"}"
