    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periradicular surgery, also known as endodontic surgery, often involves the use of a submarginal flap. The submarginal flap is a surgical technique where the incision is made in a manner that it does not involve the marginal gingiva. This technique is advantageous because it results in less gingival shrinking post-surgery. This is because the marginal gingiva, which is the part of the gum that comes into direct contact with the tooth, is not disturbed during the surgery. Therefore, the gum tissue is less likely to shrink back or recede after the surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Gingival shrinking less\"}"
