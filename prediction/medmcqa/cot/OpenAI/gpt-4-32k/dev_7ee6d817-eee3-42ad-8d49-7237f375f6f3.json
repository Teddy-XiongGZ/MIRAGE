    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alcoholic hepatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption. The liver enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are usually elevated in this condition. However, the ratio of AST to ALT is typically greater than 2:1 in alcoholic hepatitis. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can also be elevated in liver diseases, but they are not specific to alcoholic hepatitis. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a sensitive marker for alcohol consumption and is often elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. GGT\"}"
