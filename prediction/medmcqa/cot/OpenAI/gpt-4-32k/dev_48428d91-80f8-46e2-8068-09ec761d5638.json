    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The C wave in the jugular venous pulse (JVP) is due to the closure of the tricuspid valve and the resulting bulging of the valve into the right atrium during the early phase of ventricular systole. It is not due to atrial contraction, which is represented by the A wave in JVP. Atrial filling and rapid ventricular filling also do not cause the C wave.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Tricuspid bulging\"}"
