    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) supplies blood to the anterior part of the cerebellum and the lateral pons. The vestibular nuclei are located in the lateral pons and are involved in the coordination of balance and eye movements. Therefore, infarction of the AICA could potentially damage the vestibular nuclei. The pyramidal tract, lateral spinothalamic tract, and spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve are not supplied by the AICA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Vestibular nuclei\"}"
