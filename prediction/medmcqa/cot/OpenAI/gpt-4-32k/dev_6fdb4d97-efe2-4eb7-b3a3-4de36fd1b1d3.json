    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is determined by a number of factors. These include the resistance in the afferent arteriole (the blood vessel leading to the glomerulus) and the efferent arteriole (the blood vessel leading away from the glomerulus). However, 'aerial pressure' is not a term related to the factors affecting GFR. It seems like a misinterpretation or typo. Therefore, the answer cannot be 'all of the above'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Afferent aeriolar resistance, B. Efferent aeriolar resistance\"}"
