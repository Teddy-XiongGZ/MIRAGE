    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for the lower limit of the average intra-ocular pressure (IOP) that can be expected 95% of the time. This is a question about the normal distribution, where 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Since the standard deviation is 1.0, two standard deviations would be 2.0. Therefore, the lower limit of the average IOP would be the average minus two standard deviations, which is 30 - 2 = 28.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
