    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is undergoing a Modified Radical Neck Dissection (MRND) for laryngeal malignancy. During the procedure, the surgeon elevated the internal jugular vein for ligation. Suddenly, the patient's end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) dropped from 30 mmHg to 12 mmHg, and the patient developed hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. This sudden drop in EtCO2, along with hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia, is indicative of a venous air embolism. This can occur when the elevated vein is opened, allowing air to enter and travel to the heart, causing these symptoms. The other options, such as sympathetic overactivity, vagal stimulation, and carotid body stimulation, would not cause such a drastic drop in EtCO2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Venous air embolism\"}"
