    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms include point hemorrhages in the scalp, bleeding in joints, and erythematous lesions in the skin, which are all indicative of a bleeding disorder. Hemarthrosis, or bleeding into joint spaces, further supports this. The patient's diet, described as 'junk food', may lack certain nutrients necessary for proper blood clotting. Vitamin K is one such nutrient, and it is necessary for the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on certain proteins involved in blood clotting, known as coagulation factors. This process allows these factors to bind calcium ions, which is a crucial step in the clotting cascade. Therefore, a deficiency in Vitamin K, possibly due to poor diet, could lead to a defect in the carboxylation of these coagulation factors, resulting in the observed symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Carboxylation of coagulation factors\"}"
