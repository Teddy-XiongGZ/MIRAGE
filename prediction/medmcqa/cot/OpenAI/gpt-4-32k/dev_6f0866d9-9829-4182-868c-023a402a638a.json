    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nerve fibers are covered by several layers. The innermost layer is the axolemma, which is the neuron's plasma membrane. The myelin sheath is a fatty layer that covers the axon of some neurons and helps speed neural impulses. The perineurium is a sheath of connective tissue that groups nerve fibers into fascicles. The outermost layer, however, is the neurolemma, also known as the neurilemma. It is the outermost layer of the nerve fiber in the peripheral nervous system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Neurolemma\"}"
