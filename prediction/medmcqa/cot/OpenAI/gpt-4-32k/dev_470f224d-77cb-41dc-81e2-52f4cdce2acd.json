    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thyroid storm, also known as thyrotoxic crisis, is a severe, life-threatening condition caused by an excess of thyroid hormone. A number of factors can contribute to causing a thyroid storm, including: ineffective pre-operative hormonal control, which can leave the patient with too much thyroid hormone in their system; manhandling of the thyroid gland during surgery, which can cause a sudden release of large amounts of thyroid hormone; and poor preoperative preparation of the patient, which can leave the patient in a vulnerable state and more susceptible to a thyroid storm. The parathyroid tail left after surgery is not related to thyroid storm, as it pertains to the parathyroid glands, not the thyroid gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. ineffective pre-operative hormonal control, B. manhandling of the thyroid gland during surgery, D. Poor Preoperative preparation of the patient\"}"
