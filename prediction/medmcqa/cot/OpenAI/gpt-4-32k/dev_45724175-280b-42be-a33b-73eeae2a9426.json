    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cleaning, shaping, and obturation in endodontic treatment should terminate at the apical constriction. This is the narrowest part of the root canal and is the ideal location for the apical limit of endodontic procedures. The cementodentinal junction (CDJ) is not a histological landmark for the termination of these procedures. The apical foramen is the main apical opening of the root canal, but it is not the ideal location for the termination of endodontic procedures because it can vary in location and size. Therefore, the correct answer is the apical constriction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
