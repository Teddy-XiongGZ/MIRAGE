The sensory supply of the cornea is provided by the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The nasociliary nerve, a branch of the ophthalmic division, is responsible for the sensory innervation of the cornea. The other options, the infraorbital, supraorbital, and infratrochlear nerves, are also branches of the trigeminal nerve, but they do not supply the cornea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
