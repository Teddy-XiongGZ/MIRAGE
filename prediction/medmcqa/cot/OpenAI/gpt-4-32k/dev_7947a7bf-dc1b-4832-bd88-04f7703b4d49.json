    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dystrophic calcification is a type of calcification that occurs in degenerated or necrotic tissue, as a response to injury. It is not a process that occurs in healthy tissue. Enamel and dentin are hard tissues of the tooth and are not typically subject to this type of calcification. The periodontal ligament is a soft tissue that supports the tooth in the jaw, and while it can undergo calcification, it is not the most common site. The pulp, however, is a soft tissue inside the tooth that can become necrotic or degenerated due to tooth decay or trauma, making it the most likely site for dystrophic calcification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pulp\"}"
