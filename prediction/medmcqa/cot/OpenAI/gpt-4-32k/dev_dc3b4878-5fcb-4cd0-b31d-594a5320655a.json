    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. The mainstay of treatment includes beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, so it is used in heart failure. Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor that is used in combination with valsartan, an ARB, for heart failure treatment. Nesiritide is a recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide, used in acute decompensated heart failure. Trimetazidine, on the other hand, is an anti-anginal medication, which is not typically used in the management of heart failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
