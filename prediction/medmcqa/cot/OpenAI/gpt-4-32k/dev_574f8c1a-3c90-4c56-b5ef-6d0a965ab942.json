    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord. They happen in the first month of pregnancy, often before a woman even knows that she is pregnant. The two most common neural tube defects are spina bifida and anencephaly. In spina bifida, the fetal spinal column doesn't close completely. In anencephaly, most of the brain and skull do not develop. Doctors use screening tests to look for neural tube defects. One of these tests is a blood test that measures the level of a substance called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). High levels of AFP can be a sign of a neural tube defect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Alpha fetoprotein\"}"
