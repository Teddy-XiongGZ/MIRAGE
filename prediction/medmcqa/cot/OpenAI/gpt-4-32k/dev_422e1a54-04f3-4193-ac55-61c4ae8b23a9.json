    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heme synthesis is a complex process that involves multiple steps and intermediates. One of the key steps in this process is the condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine to form delta-aminolevulinic acid, which is the first committed step in heme synthesis. Therefore, the intermediate of the Krebs cycle used in heme synthesis is succinyl-CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
