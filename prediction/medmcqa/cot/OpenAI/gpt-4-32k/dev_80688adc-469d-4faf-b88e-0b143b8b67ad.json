    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of frequent abortions and pain in calf muscles suggests a condition related to blood clotting. Factor VII, Thrombin, and Protein C are all involved in the coagulation cascade. However, Factor VII and Thrombin are pro-coagulants, meaning their deficiency would lead to bleeding disorders, not clotting disorders. Protein C, on the other hand, is an anticoagulant, meaning its deficiency would lead to excessive clotting, which could explain the patient's symptoms. Plasmin is involved in the breakdown of blood clots, but its deficiency would not directly lead to the symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Protein c\"}"
