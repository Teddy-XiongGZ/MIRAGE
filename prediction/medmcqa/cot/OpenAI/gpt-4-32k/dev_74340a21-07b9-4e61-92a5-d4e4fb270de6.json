    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mean electrical axis of the heart is the average direction of all the action potentials during ventricular depolarization. It is measured in degrees. A mean axis of 90 degrees is directed downwards and to the right, which corresponds to lead III. Therefore, the maximum voltage of the R wave would be present in lead III.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
