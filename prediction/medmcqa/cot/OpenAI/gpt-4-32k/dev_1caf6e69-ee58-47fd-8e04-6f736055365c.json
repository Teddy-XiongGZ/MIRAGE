    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Trauma from occlusion refers to the damage caused to the teeth and surrounding structures due to abnormal biting forces. It can cause trauma to the marginalized gingiva (A), it is reversible if the occlusion is corrected (B), and it can lead to a reduction in the height of the alveolar crest (C). However, trauma from occlusion does not necessarily mean there will be no pocket formation (D). Pockets can form as a result of periodontal disease, which can be exacerbated by occlusal trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
