These adhesions can lead to menstrual abnormalities. Oligomenorrhea is infrequent or very light menstruation, which is not typically associated with Asherman syndrome. Metromenorrhagia is irregular, heavy, and prolonged menstrual periods, which is also not typically associated with Asherman syndrome. Polymenorrhea is the medical term for cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer, which is not typically seen in Asherman syndrome. Hypomenorrhea, on the other hand, refers to very light or infrequent menstruation, which can be a symptom of Asherman syndrome due to the scarring and adhesions reducing the uterine cavity volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
