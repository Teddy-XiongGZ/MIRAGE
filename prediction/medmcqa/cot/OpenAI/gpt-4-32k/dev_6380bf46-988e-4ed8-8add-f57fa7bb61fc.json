    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A dentigerous cyst is associated with the crown of an unerupted or developing tooth, so it's not typically associated with adjoining vital teeth. A globulomaxillary cyst is located between the roots of the maxillary lateral incisor and canine, but it's not the most common. A periapical cyst is associated with the root of a non-vital tooth, so it's not associated with vital teeth. A lateral periodontal cyst, however, is located on the lateral aspect of a vital tooth root, making it the most common cyst associated with adjoining vital teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
