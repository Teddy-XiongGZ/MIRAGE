    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Local anesthetics work by blocking the sodium channels in nerve cells, preventing the propagation of action potentials and thus blocking the transmission of pain signals. The rapid onset of action in small nerve endings is not due to an increased threshold due to depolarization, as local anesthetics actually block depolarization. The pH of nerve fibers does not directly affect the speed of onset of local anesthetics. The resting potential of nerve fibers also does not directly affect the speed of onset of local anesthetics. However, the high ratio of surface area to volume in small nerve fibers allows the anesthetic to diffuse more quickly and reach the sodium channels more easily, leading to a faster onset of action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
