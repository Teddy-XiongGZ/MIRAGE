    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amalgam is a common material used in dental fillings. The beveling of occlusal margins in an amalgam cavity preparation is not recommended due to the brittleness of amalgam. Brittleness refers to the tendency of a material to fracture or break without much plastic deformation. This means that if the edges of the amalgam filling are too thin (as they would be if the cavity margins were beveled), they could easily break or chip off.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Brittleness\"}"
