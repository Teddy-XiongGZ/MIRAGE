    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acid etching is a process used in dentistry to prepare a tooth for bonding. It does remove the smear layer, which is a layer of debris and bacteria that can interfere with bonding. It also exposes collagen, which is a protein that helps with bonding. It opens dentinal tubules, which are tiny channels in the dentin that allow for the passage of fluids and nutrients. However, acid etching does not increase surface tension. In fact, it decreases surface tension, which allows for better adhesion of the bonding material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
