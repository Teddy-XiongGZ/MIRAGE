    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibrinolytics are drugs that break down blood clots. In case of an overdose, we need to counteract this effect. Epsilon Amino Caproic Acid and Tranexamic Acid are antifibrinolytic agents, so they can be used to counteract the effect of fibrinolytics. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) contains all coagulation factors and can be used to replenish the coagulation factors depleted by fibrinolytics. DDAVP (Desmopressin) is a synthetic replacement for vasopressin, the hormone that reduces urine production. It doesn't have a role in managing fibrinolytic overdose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. DDAVP\" }"
