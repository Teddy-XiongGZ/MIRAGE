    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The latent phase of labour is the first stage of labour, during which the cervix becomes soft and thin, and begins to dilate. This phase is characterized by mild, irregular contractions that may feel like menstrual cramps. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the latent phase begins when the cervix is dilated 3-4 cm, but they are considering changing this to 5 cm. Therefore, options A, C, and D are true. Option B, however, is incorrect because the latent phase does not begin at the end of the active phase; it is the first part of the first stage of labour, preceding the active phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
