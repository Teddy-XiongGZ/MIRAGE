    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that connects the jaw to the skull. It is a complex structure that can be difficult to visualize on standard radiographic views. The transorbital view is used to visualize the orbits and the structures within them, not the TMJ. The reverse Towne's view is used to visualize the occipital bone and the foramen magnum, not the TMJ. The transpharyngeal view is used to visualize the pharynx and the structures within it, not the TMJ. The Panorex, also known as a panoramic radiograph, provides a broad view of the facial bones, including the TMJ, and is commonly used in dentistry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Panorex\"}"
