    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method for monitoring a person's oxygen saturation. It works by emitting and then absorbing a light wave passing through blood vessels (or capillaries) in the fingertip. A sensor on the other side of the fingertip picks up the light as it comes out and uses the amount of light absorbed to calculate the oxygen saturation. This principle is based on the Beer-Lambert law, which states that the concentration of a substance is directly proportional to its absorption of light.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Beer Lambert's law\"}"
