    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A non-stress test (NST) is a test for fetal well-being. It measures fetal heart rate and response to fetal movement. In high-risk pregnancies, NSTs are usually performed once or twice a week starting at around 28 weeks of gestation. The options provided here are in hours, not weeks, which is unusual.
