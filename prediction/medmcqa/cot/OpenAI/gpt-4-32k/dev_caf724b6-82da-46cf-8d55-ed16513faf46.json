    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MRI is generally better than CT scan for soft tissue tumors, as it provides better contrast resolution. Brochogenic Carcinoma, SCC of lung, and Mesothelioma are all types of lung cancer, and CT scan is usually the preferred imaging modality for these. Pancost tumor, on the other hand, is a type of lung cancer that specifically involves the apex of the lung and the surrounding structures, including the brachial plexus and sympathetic chain. MRI is superior in imaging these structures and determining the extent of the tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Pancost tumor\"}"
