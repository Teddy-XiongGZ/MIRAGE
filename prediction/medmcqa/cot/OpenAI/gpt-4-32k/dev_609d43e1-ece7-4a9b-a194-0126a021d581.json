    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver. The virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids. The different markers in the choices represent different stages or aspects of the infection. HBsAg is the surface antigen and its presence indicates current active viral replication and therefore high infectivity. HBeAg is the e antigen, which is a marker of high replication and infectivity. HBcAg is the core antigen, which is not detectable in the blood, but is a marker of infection. Anti-HBs are antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the surface antigen, indicating immunity and non-infectivity. Therefore, the maximum infective stage of hepatitis B is when the virus is actively replicating, which is indicated by the presence of HBeAg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. HBe Ag\"}"
