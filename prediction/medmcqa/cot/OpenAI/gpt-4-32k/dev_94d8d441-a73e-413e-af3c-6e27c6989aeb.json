    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endoderm is one of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo. The endoderm produces tissues within the lungs, thyroid, and pancreas. It also forms the lining of the digestive tract and the lining of the trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Therefore, epithelial cells of the intestine (A), goblet cells (C), and hepatocytes (D) are of endodermal origin. However, odontoblasts (B), which are cells in the teeth that produce dentin, are derived from ectoderm, not endoderm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
