    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dimensional stability refers to the ability of a material to maintain its shape under varying conditions. In the context of elastomeric impression materials, dimensional stability is crucial for accurate dental impressions. Addition silicone, also known as polyvinyl siloxane, is known for its excellent dimensional stability. Polyether also has good dimensional stability, but not as good as addition silicone. Polysulphide and condensation silicone have lower dimensional stability compared to the other two.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Addition silicone > Polyether > Polysulphide > Condensation silicone\"}"
