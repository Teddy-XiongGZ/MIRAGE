    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nosebleeds, or epistaxis, can be caused by a variety of factors. However, the most common cause is trauma to the nose, specifically to an area known as Little's area. This area, located on the anterior part of the nasal septum, is rich in blood vessels and is therefore prone to bleeding when injured. An arteriovenous (A.V.) aneurysm is a less common cause of nosebleeds. The postero superior part of the nasal septum and the hiatus semilunaris are not typically associated with nosebleeds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
