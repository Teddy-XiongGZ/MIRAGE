    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Xerostomia is a condition characterized by dry mouth due to reduced or absent saliva flow. The pH of saliva is typically neutral to slightly alkaline, which helps to neutralize the acids in the mouth and prevent tooth decay. In xerostomia, the quantity of saliva is reduced, but the pH of the saliva itself is not directly affected by the condition. Therefore, the pH of saliva in xerostomia should remain relatively stable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
