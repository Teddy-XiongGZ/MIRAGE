    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Primary herpes simplex is a viral infection, and its diagnosis is typically made through viral culture or PCR. Giemsa stain is typically used for staining chromosomes in cytogenetic studies, and Wright stain is used for blood films. Routine cytology is not specific enough for diagnosing herpes simplex. Fluorescent staining for cytology, on the other hand, can be used to identify the virus, as it involves the use of specific antibodies tagged with a fluorescent dye that binds to the virus, making it visible under a microscope.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Flourescent stain for cytology\"}"
