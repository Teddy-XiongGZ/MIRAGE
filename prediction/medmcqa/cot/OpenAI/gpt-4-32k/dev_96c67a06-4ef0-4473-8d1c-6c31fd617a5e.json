    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Communicable diseases are those that can be transmitted from person to person, or from an animal to a person. The spread of these diseases is often increased during disasters due to factors such as overcrowding, poor sanitation, and lack of access to healthcare services. Diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, and measles are all examples of communicable diseases that can spread in these conditions. On the other hand, malnutrition is a condition that results from a lack of proper nutrition, either due to not having enough to eat, not eating enough of the right things, or being unable to use the food that one does eat. It is not a communicable disease and cannot be spread from person to person.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
