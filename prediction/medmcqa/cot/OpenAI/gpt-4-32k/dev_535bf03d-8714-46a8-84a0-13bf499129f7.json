    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"5' capping is a modification of the 5' end of the pre-mRNA molecule in eukaryotes. It involves the addition of a guanine nucleotide to the 5' end of the mRNA. This process is important for the stability, nuclear export, and translation of the mRNA. tRNA, siRNA, and U6 snRNA are not mRNAs, so they do not require 5' capping. However, U6 snRNA is an exception among snRNAs as it does undergo 5' capping. Therefore, the answer should be either tRNA or siRNA. Since tRNA undergoes other modifications but not 5' capping, the answer is tRNA of alanine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
