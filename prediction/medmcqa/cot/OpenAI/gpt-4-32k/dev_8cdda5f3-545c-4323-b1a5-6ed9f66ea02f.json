    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The outer membrane of a peripheral nerve, also known as the neuronal membrane, is selectively permeable. This means it allows certain ions to pass through while blocking others. Sodium ions and potassium ions are two of the most important ions in nerve signal transmission. The membrane is more permeable to potassium ions than to sodium ions, which is crucial for the generation of the resting membrane potential and action potentials. Chloride ions can also pass through the membrane, but this is not a characteristic feature. The membrane is not impermeable to potassium ions, as potassium ions play a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Relative permeable to potassium ions\"}"
