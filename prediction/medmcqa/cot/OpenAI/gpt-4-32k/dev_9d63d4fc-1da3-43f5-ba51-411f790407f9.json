    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone. This hormone is responsible for regulating calcium levels in the body.

Additionally, the parathyroid hormone also stimulates bone resorption, which can lead to bone loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
