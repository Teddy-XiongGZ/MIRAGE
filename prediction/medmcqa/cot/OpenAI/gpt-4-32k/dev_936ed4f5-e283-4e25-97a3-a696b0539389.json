    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The condyle is a part of the mandible or lower jaw. The muscles involved in the movement of the mandible are the muscles of mastication, which include the masseter, the medial pterygoid, and the lateral pterygoid. The masseter and medial pterygoid are primarily involved in elevation of the mandible, or closing the mouth. The lateral pterygoid, on the other hand, is primarily responsible for protrusion of the mandible, or opening the mouth, which involves translation of the condyle. The superior constrictor of the pharynx is not directly involved in the movement of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Lateral pterygoid\"}"
