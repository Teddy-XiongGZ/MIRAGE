    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sudden death is a result of a catastrophic event, not necessarily an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Stable angina is a type of chest pain that typically occurs with exertion and goes away with rest, it's not directly related to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Unstable angina is a condition in which your heart doesn't get enough blood flow and oxygen, it may lead to a heart attack, but it's not the direct result of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Myocardial infarction, or heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to a part of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. This is directly related to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Myocardial infarction\"}"
