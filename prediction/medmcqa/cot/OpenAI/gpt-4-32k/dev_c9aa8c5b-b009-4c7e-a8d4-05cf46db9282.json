    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Morphine is a potent opioid analgesic used to relieve severe pain. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the perception of pain. However, it can also cause a number of side effects. Itching is a common side effect of morphine, as it can cause histamine release. Urinary retention is another common side effect, as morphine can increase the tone of the bladder sphincter. Increased vomiting is also possible, as morphine can stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain, leading to nausea and vomiting. However, morphine is a respiratory depressant, not a stimulant. It can slow down breathing, not speed it up.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Overstimulation of respiratory centre\"}"
