    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A band and loop space maintainer is a dental device used to maintain the space left by a prematurely lost primary tooth. It is contraindicated in cases of high caries susceptibility (option A) because the band can trap food and plaque, increasing the risk of caries. It is also contraindicated in cases of moderate to severe space loss (option C) because the device may not be able to maintain the space effectively. Lower anterior crowding (option D) is another contraindication because the device may exacerbate the crowding. However, a single tooth missing in the posterior region (option B) is not a contraindication. In fact, this is a common indication for a band and loop space maintainer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }"
