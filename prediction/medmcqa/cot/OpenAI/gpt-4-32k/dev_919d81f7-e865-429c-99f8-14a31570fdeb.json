    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"TNM Staging is a system used to classify cancer based on certain parameters. The 'T' stands for the size of the tumor, 'N' for the number of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer, and 'M' for metastasis, or whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This system is not based on equal intervals or ratios, but rather on a specific order of severity. Therefore, it is an ordinal scale, where the categories have a clear order or ranking, but the differences between the categories are not necessarily equal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
