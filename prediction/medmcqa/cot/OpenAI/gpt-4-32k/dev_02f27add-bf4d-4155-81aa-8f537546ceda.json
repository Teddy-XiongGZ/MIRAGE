    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the substance used to clean blood on an operating theatre (OT) floor. It's important to note that the substance used must be able to effectively kill a wide range of pathogens to prevent the spread of infection. Phenol is a disinfectant, but it's not commonly used in healthcare settings due to its toxicity. Alcohol-based compounds are effective disinfectants, but they evaporate quickly and may not be suitable for cleaning large areas like floors. Chlorine-based compounds are commonly used in healthcare settings for cleaning and disinfecting because they are effective against a wide range of pathogens. Quaternary ammonium compounds are also used as disinfectants, but they are not as effective against certain types of bacteria and viruses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Chlorine based compounds\"}"
