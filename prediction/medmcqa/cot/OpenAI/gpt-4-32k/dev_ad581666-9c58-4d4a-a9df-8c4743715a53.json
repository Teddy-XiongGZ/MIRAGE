    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oxidases are enzymes involved in the process of oxidation, which involves the loss of electrons. Lipases are enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of fats. Transferases, on the other hand, are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a functional group from one molecule to another. Therefore, the enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a molecule group from one molecule to another is a transferase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Transferases\"}"
