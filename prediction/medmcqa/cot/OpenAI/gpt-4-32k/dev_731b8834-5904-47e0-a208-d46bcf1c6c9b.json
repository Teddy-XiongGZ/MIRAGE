    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve, controls most of the eye movements, the constriction of the pupil, and maintaining an open eyelid. Therefore, a palsy of this nerve can lead to ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), pupil dilation, and impaired pupillary reflex. However, outward upward rolling of the pupil is not a symptom of 3rd nerve palsy. This symptom is more associated with 4th nerve palsy, also known as trochlear nerve palsy, which affects the superior oblique muscle leading to problems with downward and inward eye movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" }"
