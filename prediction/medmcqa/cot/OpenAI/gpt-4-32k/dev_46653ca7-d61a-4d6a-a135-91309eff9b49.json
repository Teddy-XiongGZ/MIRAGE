    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Case fatality rate is the proportion of deaths within a designated population of 'cases' (people with a specified disease), over a certain period of time. It is not the best index for burden of disease as it only considers mortality and not morbidity or disability. Morbidity data refers to the incidence or prevalence of a disease or medical condition. This is an important measure but does not consider the impact of the disease on quality of life or disability. Dependency ratio is a measure used in economics, not in measuring disease burden. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) is a measure that combines both morbidity and mortality data. It considers the years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with disability. Therefore, it provides a more comprehensive measure of the burden of disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
