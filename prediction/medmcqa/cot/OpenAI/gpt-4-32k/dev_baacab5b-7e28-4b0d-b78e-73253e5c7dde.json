    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a marathon runner who developed pain at the anteromedial aspect of the tibia after running. This is a common location for shin splints, which are often caused by overuse or repetitive stress on the lower leg, especially in runners. The pain was mild at first but increased with further running, which is also characteristic of shin splints. An X-ray was normal, which is expected as shin splints are a soft tissue condition and do not involve a fracture or other bone abnormality. A bone scan was ordered, likely to rule out stress fractures or other bone conditions. The other options, Lisfranc fracture, Jones fracture, and Nutcracker fracture, are specific types of fractures that would likely show up on an X-ray and do not match the location and symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
