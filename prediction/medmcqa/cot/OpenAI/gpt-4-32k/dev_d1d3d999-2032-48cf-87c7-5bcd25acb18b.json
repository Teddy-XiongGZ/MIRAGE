    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4. This means it can increase the levels of many drugs metabolized by this enzyme, leading to potential toxicity. Amiodarone, Cisapride, and Midazolam are all metabolized by CYP3A4, so their levels would be expected to increase with Ritonavir. Phenytoin, on the other hand, is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, not CYP3A4. Therefore, Ritonavir should not significantly affect its levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Phenytoin\"}"
