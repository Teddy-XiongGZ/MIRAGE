    "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Composite restoration is a common dental procedure that involves the use of a tooth-colored resin to repair decayed, chipped, fractured, or discolored teeth. Let's analyze each option: A. Greater localized occlusal wear - This is a disadvantage as composite restorations tend to wear out faster than other materials like amalgam or porcelain. B. Recurrent secondary caries - This is also a disadvantage as composite restorations are more prone to secondary caries due to the difficulty in achieving a perfect seal. C. Technique sensitive - This is a disadvantage as well. The success of composite restorations heavily depends on the technique used by the dentist. D. More time in replacement - This is not necessarily a disadvantage. The time taken for replacement would depend on various factors like the size of the restoration, the technique used, and the skill of the dentist. Therefore, it's not a direct disadvantage of composite restoration itself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" }"
