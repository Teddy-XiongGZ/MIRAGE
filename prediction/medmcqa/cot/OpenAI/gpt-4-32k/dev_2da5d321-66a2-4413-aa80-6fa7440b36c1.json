    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The distal palatal termination of the maxillary complete denture base is determined by the anatomical structure that marks the boundary between the movable and immovable tissues in the mouth. The vibrating line, an imaginary line across the posterior part of the palate, marks this boundary. The fovea palatine, tuberosity, and maxillary torus are all anatomical structures in the mouth, but they do not dictate the distal palatal termination of the maxillary complete denture base.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
