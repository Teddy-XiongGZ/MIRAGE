    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A tooth with a nonvital pulp and a sinus is typically a case of dental abscess. The sinus in this context is a tract that forms from the root of the tooth to the surface of the gums or skin to allow pus to drain. It's not a sinus in the sense of the nasal sinuses. The treatment of such a condition involves addressing the source of the infection, which is the nonvital pulp. This is typically done through root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth. The sinus itself does not require special treatment, cauterisation, or curettage. Once the source of the infection is addressed, the sinus will heal on its own.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
