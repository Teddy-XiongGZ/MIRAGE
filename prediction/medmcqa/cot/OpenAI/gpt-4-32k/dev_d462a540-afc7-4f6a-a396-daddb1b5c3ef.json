    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cervical resorption is a process where the body absorbs the root surface of a tooth, which can lead to tooth loss. It can be caused by various factors, including trauma, orthodontic treatment, and bleaching. The question is asking how to prevent cervical resorption after bleaching. Option A, 80% alcohol drying, is not likely to prevent resorption as it does not provide any protective effect on the tooth structure. Option B, Alpha tocopherol, is a form of Vitamin E and has antioxidant properties, but there is no evidence to suggest it can prevent cervical resorption after bleaching. Option C, Sodium perborate + sodium hypochlorite, are both bleaching agents and would not prevent resorption. Option D, Sodium perborate + calcium hydroxide, seems the most plausible. Sodium perborate is a bleaching agent, while calcium hydroxide is often used in dentistry to stimulate the formation of dentin, a hard tissue that can protect the tooth from resorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
