    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A space maintainer is a device that is custom-made by a dentist in acrylic or metal material. It can be either removable or cemented in a child's mouth. Its purpose is to keep the space open to allow the permanent tooth to erupt and come into place. Restored deciduous tooth is not a space maintainer, it's a natural tooth that has been treated. Acrylic partial denture is a removable prosthesis that replaces missing teeth, not specifically designed to maintain space for erupting teeth. Distal shoe space maintainer is used when the second primary molar is lost before the permanent first molar has erupted. However, it requires careful monitoring and it's not the best choice. Band and loop space maintainer is the most commonly used space maintainer in children's dentistry. It's simple, durable and does not interfere with erupting teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
