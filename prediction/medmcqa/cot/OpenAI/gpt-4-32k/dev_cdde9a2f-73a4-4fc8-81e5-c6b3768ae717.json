    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chronic pulpal infection, also known as pulpitis, is an inflammation of the dental pulp, which is the innermost part of the tooth. This condition can lead to various radiographic signs. However, the first sign is usually not periapical bony changes, as these occur later in the disease process. Root resorption is also not the first sign, as it is a consequence of prolonged inflammation. Changes in the bony furcation area are also not the first sign, as they are more associated with periodontal disease. The widening of the apical periodontal ligament is often the first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection. This is because the inflammation in the pulp can cause an increase in pressure, leading to a widening of the periodontal ligament space at the root apex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
