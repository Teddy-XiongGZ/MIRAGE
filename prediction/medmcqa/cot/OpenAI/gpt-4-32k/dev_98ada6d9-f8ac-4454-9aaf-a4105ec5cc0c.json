    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandible is the lower jawbone, and it's unique because it's the only movable bone in the skull. When a fracture occurs, the forces acting on the mandible change. If the fracture is posterior, the forces are distributed differently. The upper border of the mandible, which is closer to the point of attachment with the skull, would experience tension as it is pulled away from the fracture site. The lower border, being further away, would experience compression as the forces push it towards the fracture site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Tension on upper border\"}"
