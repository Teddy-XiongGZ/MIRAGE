    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The root canal procedure involves cleaning and shaping the root canal system, and then filling it to prevent re-infection. The termination point of a root canal procedure is the apical constriction. This is the narrowest part of the root canal and is located just before the apical foramen, which is the opening at the tip of the root. The apical constriction is the ideal termination point because it allows for the most complete cleaning and filling of the canal, while minimizing the risk of overfilling and causing damage to the surrounding tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Apical constriction\"}"
