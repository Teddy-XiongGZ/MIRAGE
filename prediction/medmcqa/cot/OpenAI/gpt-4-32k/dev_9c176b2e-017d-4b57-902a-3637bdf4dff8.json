    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Efferent arteriole constriction refers to the narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood away from the glomerulus in the kidney. This constriction can have several effects. A. Decreased GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) - This is true because when the efferent arteriole constricts, it decreases the rate at which blood is filtered in the glomerulus. B. Increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure - This is also true because when the efferent arteriole constricts, it increases the pressure in the glomerulus as blood is not able to leave as quickly. C. Decreased blood flow in peritubular vessels - This is true because when the efferent arteriole constricts, it decreases the amount of blood that can flow into the peritubular vessels. D. Increased oncotic pressure in peritubular vessels - This is not true. Oncotic pressure refers to the pressure exerted by proteins in the blood that usually helps to pull water into the circulatory system from the extracellular space. Constriction of the efferent arteriole would not directly increase the oncotic pressure in the peritubular vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
