    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A high risk infant is one who is at significant risk for physical or mental disabilities or death due to conditions that are often associated with prematurity and/or low birth weight. Let's consider the options: A. Mal-presentation - This is a risk factor for difficult labor and delivery, but it doesn't necessarily make the infant high risk. B. Folic acid tablet not consumed - This could potentially increase the risk of neural tube defects, but it's not a direct indicator of a high risk infant. C. Working mother - This is not a medical risk factor for a high risk infant. D. Antenatal preeclampsia - This is a condition in pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure, sometimes with fluid retention and proteinuria. If it's severe, it can negatively affect the baby's health, making the infant high risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
