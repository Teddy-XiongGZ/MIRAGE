    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tooth structure cutting is a process that involves the propagation of cracks due to tensile forces. This is a characteristic of brittle materials, which fracture when subjected to stress, producing sharp edges. Brittle fracture is the type of fracture that occurs without any plastic deformation and is characterized by crack propagation. Ductile fracture involves significant plastic deformation before fracture. Shear fracture is a type of fracture where the microscopic displacement of the surfaces on either side of the crack plane is parallel to this plane. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that describes the fracture without plastic deformation and with crack propagation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
