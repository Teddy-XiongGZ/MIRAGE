    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"APAF-1, or Apoptotic Protease Activating Factor 1, is a key player in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. It forms a complex known as the apoptosome with cytochrome c and procaspase-9. This complex leads to the activation of caspase-9, which then activates other caspases such as caspase-3. Therefore, APAF-1 is directly involved in the activation of caspase-9.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Caspase 9\"}"
