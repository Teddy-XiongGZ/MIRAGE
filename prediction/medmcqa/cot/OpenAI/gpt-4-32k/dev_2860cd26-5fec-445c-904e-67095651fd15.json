    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Standardization is a statistical technique that allows for the comparison of two different populations by eliminating the effects of certain confounding variables, such as age or gender. This is true, so option A is not the answer. Direct standardization involves applying the age-specific rates of the study population to the standard population, which is correct, so option C is not the answer. Indirect standardization involves applying the age-specific rates of the standard population to the study population, which is also correct, so option D is not the answer. The standard population is not always the national population. It can be any population that is used as a comparison group, so option B is the incorrect statement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
