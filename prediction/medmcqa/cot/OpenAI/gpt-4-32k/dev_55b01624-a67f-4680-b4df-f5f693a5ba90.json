    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is related to physics, specifically Hooke's Law, which states that the force needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance is proportional to that distance. This means that if you double the length of the spring, the force required to do so is also doubled.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
