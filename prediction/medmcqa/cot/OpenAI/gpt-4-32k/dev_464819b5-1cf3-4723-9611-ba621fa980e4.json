    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Irreversible hydrocolloids are used in dentistry for impressions. The setting time of these materials is influenced by the temperature of the water used for mixing. Higher temperatures accelerate the chemical reactions involved in setting, thus decreasing the setting time. On the other hand, lower temperatures slow down these reactions, increasing the setting time. Using excess water for mixing would not decrease the setting time, it would rather dilute the mixture and potentially affect the quality of the impression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
