    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has received one dose of DPT and OPV at 2 months of age. According to the immunization schedule, the second dose of DPT and OPV should be given at 4 months of age, and the third dose at 6 months. The child is now 18 months old, so they are overdue for these doses. However, the immunization schedule does not need to be restarted. BCG is usually given at birth, so it's not needed now. Measles vaccine is typically given at 9-12 months of age, so it should be included in the next immunization plan. Therefore, the child should receive the overdue doses of DPT and OPV, as well as the measles vaccine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Measles, booster dose of DPT and OPV\"}"
