    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to move and maintain balance and posture. It is the most common motor disability in childhood. There are several types of cerebral palsy, including spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, and mixed. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. It is characterized by increased muscle tone, which leads to stiffness and movement difficulties. Spastic quadriplegia affects all four limbs, the trunk, and the face. This type of cerebral palsy is often associated with severe motor impairment and can lead to other health issues, including scoliosis and other orthopedic problems. Anterior cerebral palsy is not a recognized type of cerebral palsy. Spastic diplegia primarily affects the lower body, and atonic cerebral palsy, also known as hypotonic cerebral palsy, is characterized by low muscle tone and strength, not increased muscle tone and stiffness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A.
