    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepatic scintigraphy, also known as a HIDA scan, is a test used to visualize the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, and small intestine. Non-visualization of the gallbladder during this test can occur due to several reasons. Chronic cholecystitis, or long-term inflammation of the gallbladder, could potentially lead to non-visualization, but it's not the most common cause. Carcinoma of the gallbladder could also potentially lead to non-visualization, but again, it's not the most common cause. Gallstones obstructing the common bile duct (CBD) could potentially lead to non-visualization, but the gallbladder itself should still be visible unless the stone is specifically obstructing the cystic duct. The most common cause of non-visualization of the gallbladder on a HIDA scan is acute cholecystitis due to gallstones, specifically when a stone is obstructing the cystic duct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Acute cholecystitis due to gallstones\"}"
