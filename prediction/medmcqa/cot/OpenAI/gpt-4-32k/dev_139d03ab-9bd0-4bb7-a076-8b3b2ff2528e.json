    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-linking fixatives work by creating covalent chemical bonds between proteins in tissues, which helps to preserve the structure of the tissue. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are both well-known cross-linking fixatives. Methanol is also a fixative, but it works by precipitating proteins, not by cross-linking them. Osmium tetroxide is a fixative used in electron microscopy, but it works by depositing osmium, which enhances electron density and contrast, not by cross-linking proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Osmium tetroxide\"}"
