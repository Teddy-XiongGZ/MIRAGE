    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The trochlear nerve, also known as the fourth cranial nerve, innervates the superior oblique muscle of the eye, which is responsible for downward and inward eye movement. A palsy of this nerve can lead to diplopia (double vision) on upward gaze and adduction (A), as the affected eye will drift upward due to unopposed action of the inferior oblique muscle. It can also lead to a compensatory head tilt to the opposite side (B) to minimize diplopia. Exotropia (C), or outward turning of the eye, can also occur as a result of the unopposed action of the lateral rectus muscle. However, hyperopia (D), or farsightedness, is a refractive error of the eye and is not related to the function of the trochlear nerve or the muscles it innervates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
