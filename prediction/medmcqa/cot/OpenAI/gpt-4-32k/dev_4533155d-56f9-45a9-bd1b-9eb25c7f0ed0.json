    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tongue is divided into two parts: the anterior two-thirds, also known as the oral part, and the posterior one-third, also known as the pharyngeal part. The boundary between these two parts is marked by a V-shaped groove called the sulcus terminalis. Passavant's ridge is a muscular structure in the pharynx, not the tongue. Circumvallate papillae are a type of papillae found on the tongue, but they do not demarcate the two parts of the tongue. Filiform papillae are the most numerous papillae on the tongue, but they also do not demarcate the two parts of the tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Sulcus terminalis\"}"
