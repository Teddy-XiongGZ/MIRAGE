    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The avulsed tooth needs to be cleaned before reimplantation. However, curettage or scrubbing of the root surface can damage the periodontal ligament cells which are vital for the reattachment of the tooth. Therefore, these options can be ruled out. Root canal treatment (RCT) is not necessary immediately after avulsion and can be performed later if needed. Hence, the best option is to clean the root surface with saline and reimplant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
