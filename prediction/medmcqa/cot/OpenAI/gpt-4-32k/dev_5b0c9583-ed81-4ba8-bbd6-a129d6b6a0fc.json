    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bismuth Oxide is used in MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate) for radiopacity. However, it can cause discoloration. Therefore, in newer materials, it is replaced with something that can provide the same radiopacity without the discoloration. Terbium-Dysprosium is not commonly used in dental materials. Tantalum Oxide is not typically used in dental materials either. Bismuth Carbonate is still Bismuth, so it would likely cause the same discoloration. Titanium Oxide, however, is commonly used in dental materials and does not cause discoloration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Titanium Oxide\"}"
