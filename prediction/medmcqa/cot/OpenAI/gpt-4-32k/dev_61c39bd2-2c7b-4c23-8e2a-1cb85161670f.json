    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Etanercept is a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). It is a TNF inhibitor, which means it works by blocking the action of a substance in the body called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha. TNF alpha is involved in systemic inflammation and is therefore an appropriate target for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 inhibitors are a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), not a DMARD. IL-6 inhibitors are another type of biologic DMARD, but etanercept is not in this class. Stabilization of mast cells is not the mechanism of action of etanercept.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
