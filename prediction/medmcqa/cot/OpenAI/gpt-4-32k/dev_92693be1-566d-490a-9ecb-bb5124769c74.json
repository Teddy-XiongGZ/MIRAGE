    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Caries, or tooth decay, is most commonly found in areas where food and bacteria can easily get stuck and are not easily cleaned away. The occlusal pits and fissures of the teeth, which are the grooves on the chewing surfaces, are such areas. They are more prone to caries because they are difficult to clean and provide a suitable environment for bacteria to thrive. The proximal areas, buccal surface, and above the contact point are less likely because they are easier to clean and less likely to trap food and bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
