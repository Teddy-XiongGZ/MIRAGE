    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking for advice on emergency contraception for a woman who had unprotected sex five days ago. Copper IUCD (A) can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected sex, but it requires a procedure and is not the first choice for emergency contraception. Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg (B) is a form of emergency contraception, but it is most effective when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. Two tablets of high dose OCP, repeated after 24 hours (C) is another form of emergency contraception, also known as the Yuzpe regimen, and can be used up to 72 hours after unprotected sex. Laparoscopic tubectomy (D) is a permanent form of contraception and not suitable for emergency contraception. Considering the time frame of 5 days, the best option would be Copper IUCD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
