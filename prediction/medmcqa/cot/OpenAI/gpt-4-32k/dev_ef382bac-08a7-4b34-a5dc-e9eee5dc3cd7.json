    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Isosorbide 5-mononitrate is a nitrate used for heart-related conditions like angina. It works by relaxing and widening blood vessels so blood can flow more easily to the heart. The reason it is preferred is not because it has less tolerance development, as tolerance to nitrates can develop with any type. Sublingual absorption is not a factor as it is usually taken orally. Direct coronary vasodilatory action is not more than other nitrates. However, it does have a longer duration of action compared to other nitrates, which makes it more convenient for patients as it requires less frequent dosing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
