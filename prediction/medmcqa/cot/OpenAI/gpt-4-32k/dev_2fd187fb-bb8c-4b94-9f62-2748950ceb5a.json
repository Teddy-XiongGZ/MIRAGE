    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiopental is a barbiturate anesthetic that is highly lipid soluble, which allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier quickly and induce anesthesia. However, its duration of action is short because it rapidly redistributes from the brain to other tissues, such as muscle and fat. This is not due to rapid biotransformation, as thiopental is metabolized relatively slowly. It also does not accumulate rapidly in body fat, but rather redistributes to it. High lipid solubility contributes to its rapid onset, not its short duration. Therefore, the factor that contributes to the short duration of anesthetic action of a single dose of thiopental is its ability to enter and leave brain tissue very rapidly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
