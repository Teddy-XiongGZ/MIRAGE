    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fixed drug eruptions are a type of adverse drug reaction characterized by the development of well-demarcated, round or oval erythematous patches or plaques that recur at the same site each time the drug is taken. They are typically seen with certain medications. To determine which medication is frequently associated with fixed drug eruptions, we need to consider the common culprits. Penicillin and sulfonamide are known to be common causes of fixed drug eruptions. Cetirizine is an antihistamine that is generally well-tolerated and not commonly associated with fixed drug eruptions. Roxithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic and is not typically associated with fixed drug eruptions. Therefore, the correct answer is either A. Penicillin or B. Sulfonamide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
