    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of bilateral cornual block on hysterosalpingography indicates a blockage in the fallopian tubes near the uterine cornua. This can prevent the sperm from reaching the egg and can lead to infertility. The ideal management in this case would be to consider surgical intervention to address the blockage. A. Tuboplasty involves the surgical repair of the fallopian tubes. It may be considered as an option to remove the blockage and restore the normal function of the tubes. B. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) is a technique where fertilization occurs outside the body, in a laboratory. It bypasses the need for the fallopian tubes and can be considered as an alternative option for infertility treatment, but it does not directly address the blockage in the cornua. C. Hydrotubation is a procedure where fluid is injected into the fallopian tubes to clear any blockages. However, in the case of bilateral cornual block, this procedure may not be effective in resolving the blockage. D. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy are minimally invasive surgical procedures that can be used to visualize and treat abnormalities in the uterus and fallopian tubes. This option would allow for direct visualization of the cornual block and potential removal of the blockage. Considering the above options, the most appropriate choice for the management of a woman with bilateral cornual block on hysterosalpingography would be D. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
