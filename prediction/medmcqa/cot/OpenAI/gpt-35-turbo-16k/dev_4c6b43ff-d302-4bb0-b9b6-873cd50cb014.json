    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Physiological methods of heat loss from the body are mechanisms that the body uses to regulate its temperature. Sweating is a physiological method of heat loss, as it involves the secretion of sweat onto the skin surface, which then evaporates and cools the body. Vasodilation is also a physiological method of heat loss, as it involves the dilation of blood vessels near the skin surface, allowing for increased blood flow and heat dissipation. Peripheral vasoconstriction, on the other hand, is a physiological method of heat conservation, not heat loss. It involves the constriction of blood vessels near the skin surface, reducing blood flow and heat loss. Posture is not a physiological method of heat loss, as it does not directly involve any mechanisms for heat dissipation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Posture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
