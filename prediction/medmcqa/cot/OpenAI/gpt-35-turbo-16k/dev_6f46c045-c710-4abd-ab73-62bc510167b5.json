This suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute one. The most likely diagnosis in this case is geographic tongue. Geographic tongue is a benign condition characterized by irregular, map-like patches on the surface of the tongue. These patches can vary in size and shape, and may come and go over time. Median rhomboid glossitis is characterized by a smooth, flat, erythematous area in the midline of the dorsal surface of the tongue. Black hairy tongue is characterized by elongation and discoloration of the filiform papillae, giving the tongue a black or brown appearance. Moeller's glossitis is a rare condition characterized by atrophy and depapillation of the tongue, but it is usually associated with other systemic conditions such as pernicious anemia or malnutrition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
