    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In full tooth borne dentures, occlusal rests are used to distribute occlusal forces to the supporting teeth. The purpose of occlusal rests is to provide stability and prevent excessive forces on the abutment teeth. The percentage of occlusal forces transmitted to the teeth depends on the design and placement of the occlusal rests. Generally, occlusal rests transmit a certain percentage of the occlusal forces to the teeth. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the purpose of occlusal rests and their role in distributing forces. Based on this information, the answer choice that best represents the percentage of occlusal forces transmitted to the teeth is the one that aligns with the purpose of occlusal rests.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 100%\"}"
