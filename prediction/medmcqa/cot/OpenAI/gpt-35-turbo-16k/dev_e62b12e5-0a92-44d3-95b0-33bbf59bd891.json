    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DNA methylation is a process in which a methyl group is added to the DNA molecule. It plays a role in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and genome stability. Mismatch repair is a mechanism that corrects errors in DNA replication, so it is not directly related to DNA methylation. DNA replication is the process of copying DNA, and DNA methylation can affect this process by influencing the accessibility of DNA to replication machinery. Gene silencing is a process in which gene expression is suppressed, and DNA methylation is known to be involved in gene silencing. Capping, on the other hand, refers to the addition of a modified nucleotide to the 5' end of mRNA molecules, and it is not directly related to DNA methylation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Capping.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
