    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The transport of CO is diffusion limited because CO has a higher affinity for hemoglobin (Hb) than oxygen (O2). This means that CO binds avidly with Hb, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), and reduces the availability of Hb for oxygen transport. As a result, the partial pressure of CO in the blood is higher compared to the partial pressure of O2. Additionally, CO is highly soluble in water, so it is readily absorbed in the blood. Lastly, the alveolar membrane is highly permeable to CO, allowing for efficient diffusion of CO from the alveoli into the bloodstream.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
