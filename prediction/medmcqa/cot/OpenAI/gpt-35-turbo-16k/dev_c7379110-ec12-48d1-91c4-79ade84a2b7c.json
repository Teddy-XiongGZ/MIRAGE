    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxillary first molar is located in the upper jaw. When there is an infection in this tooth, it can spread to the surrounding spaces. The submandibular space is located beneath the mandible, which is not directly connected to the maxillary first molar. The infratemporal space is located deep to the temporal bone, which is also not directly connected to the maxillary first molar. The infraorbital space is located below the eye socket, which is not directly connected to the maxillary first molar. The buccal space, on the other hand, is located in the cheek region and is in close proximity to the maxillary first molar. Therefore, the infection from the maxillary first molar drains into the buccal space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Buccal space\"}"
