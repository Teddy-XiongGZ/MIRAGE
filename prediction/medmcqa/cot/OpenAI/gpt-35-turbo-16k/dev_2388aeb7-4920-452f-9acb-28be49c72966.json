    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autoinfection refers to the ability of a parasite to infect the same host repeatedly without the need for an external source of infection. It occurs when the parasite's life cycle allows it to complete its development within the same host. To determine which helminth does not cause autoinfection, we need to consider the life cycles of each helminth. \\n\\nA. Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) causes autoinfection. The eggs are ingested, hatch in the small intestine, and the larvae mature into adult worms in the large intestine. The female worms migrate to the perianal area to lay eggs, leading to reinfection.\\n\\nB. Hymenolepis nana (dwarf tapeworm) can cause autoinfection. The eggs are ingested, hatch in the small intestine, and the larvae mature into adult worms. The adult worms can produce eggs that can reinfect the same host.\\n\\nC. Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) can cause autoinfection. The eggs are ingested, hatch in the small intestine, and the larvae migrate to various tissues, including the brain. If the larvae reach the intestine again, they can develop into adult worms.\\n\\nD. Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm) does not cause autoinfection. The eggs are ingested, hatch in the small intestine, and the larvae migrate to the lungs. From the lungs, they are coughed up and swallowed, returning to the small intestine to develop into adult worms. However, there is no reinfection within the same host.\\n\\nBased on this information, the helminth that does not cause autoinfection is Ascaris lumbricoides.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
