    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If one parent is homozygous for an autosomal recessive gene, it means they have two copies of the recessive gene. If the other parent is heterozygous, it means they have one copy of the recessive gene and one copy of the dominant gene. When these two parents have children, each child will inherit one copy of the gene from each parent. Since the recessive gene is autosomal, it is not located on the sex chromosomes. This means that both males and females have an equal chance of inheriting the gene. To determine the outcome, we need to consider the possible combinations of genes that the children can inherit. There are four possible combinations: 1. Child inherits the recessive gene from the homozygous parent and the dominant gene from the heterozygous parent. 2. Child inherits the recessive gene from both parents. 3. Child inherits the dominant gene from both parents. 4. Child inherits the dominant gene from the heterozygous parent and the recessive gene from the homozygous parent. Out of these four combinations, only the second combination (child inherits the recessive gene from both parents) will result in the child being affected by the autosomal recessive condition. The other three combinations will result in the child being a carrier of the gene, meaning they have one copy of the recessive gene but do not show any symptoms. Therefore, the answer is: D. 25% children affected, rest are carriers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
