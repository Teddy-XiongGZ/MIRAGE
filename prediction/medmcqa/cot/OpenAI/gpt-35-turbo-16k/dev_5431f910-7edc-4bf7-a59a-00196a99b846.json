    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, including the heart valves. It is more likely to occur in individuals with certain heart conditions. To determine which lesion has a lower risk of endocarditis, we need to consider the characteristics of each lesion. VSD (ventricular septal defect), MR (mitral regurgitation), AR (aortic regurgitation), and ASD (atrial septal defect) are all heart conditions that can increase the risk of endocarditis. However, among these options, ASD is less likely to be associated with endocarditis compared to the others. Therefore, the answer is D. ASD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
