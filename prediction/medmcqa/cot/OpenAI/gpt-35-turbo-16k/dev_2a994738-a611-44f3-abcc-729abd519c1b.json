    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Benzoyl peroxide is commonly used as a initiator in the polymerization of acrylic resin. It decomposes at elevated temperatures to form free radicals, which initiate the polymerization process. To determine the temperature at which benzoyl peroxide forms free radicals, we need to consider its decomposition temperature. The decomposition temperature of benzoyl peroxide is typically around 60\u00b0C. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 60\u00b0C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
