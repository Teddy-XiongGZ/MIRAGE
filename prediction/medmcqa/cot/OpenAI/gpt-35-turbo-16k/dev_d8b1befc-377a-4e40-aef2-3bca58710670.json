    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the findings of Rinne's test and Weber test, the patient has bilateral conductive hearing loss. Rinne's test showing air conduction greater than bone conduction on both sides indicates a possible conductive hearing loss. The Weber test lateralizing to the right ear suggests that the right ear is affected more than the left. Given these findings, the next logical step would be to perform Schwabach's test to further evaluate the patient's hearing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Schwabach's test\"}"
