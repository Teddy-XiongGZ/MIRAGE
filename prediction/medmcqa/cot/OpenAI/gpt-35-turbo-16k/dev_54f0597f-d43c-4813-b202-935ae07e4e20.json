    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ceramide is a type of lipid. To determine its classification, we need to understand its structure and function. Ceramide is composed of a fatty acid linked to a sphingosine backbone. It does not contain any additional groups or molecules attached to it, so it is not a compound lipid. Ceramide is also not a precursor lipid because it is not a precursor to other lipids. It is, however, a precursor to other molecules such as sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids. Ceramide is not derived from other lipids, so it is not a derived lipid. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Simple lipid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
