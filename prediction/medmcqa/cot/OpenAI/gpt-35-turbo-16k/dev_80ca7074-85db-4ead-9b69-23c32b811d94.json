    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The halo effect surrounding the root of a tooth on an IOPA X-Ray is typically seen with periapical-periostitis. This is an inflammatory condition involving both the periapical region (around the root tip) and the periosteum (outer layer of bone). The halo effect is caused by the accumulation of inflammatory fluid in the surrounding tissues, resulting in a radiolucent halo appearance. Horizontal root fracture, root caries, and widening of the periodontal ligament space would not typically present with a halo effect on an X-Ray.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
