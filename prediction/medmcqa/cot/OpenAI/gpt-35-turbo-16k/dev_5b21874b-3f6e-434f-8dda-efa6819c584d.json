    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Excessive forces of occlusion refers to excessive pressure or stress on the teeth and supporting structures. The periodontal ligament (PDL) is the connective tissue that surrounds and attaches the tooth root to the surrounding bone. When excessive forces are applied, the PDL can be affected. A. Increase width of PDL: Excessive forces of occlusion can cause inflammation and widening of the PDL. This is known as widening of the PDL space and is a common finding in cases of trauma from occlusion. B. Decrease width of PDL: Excessive forces of occlusion do not typically cause a decrease in the width of the PDL. C. Width will remain the same: Excessive forces of occlusion can cause changes in the width of the PDL, so this option is not correct. D. Trauma from occlusion: Excessive forces of occlusion can lead to trauma from occlusion, which refers to injury or damage to the teeth or supporting structures due to excessive pressure or stress. This can include damage to the PDL. Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is D. Trauma from occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
