    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Asbestosis is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers. It is characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties. Asbestosis is typically associated with long-term exposure to asbestos and usually takes several years to develop. The disease does not progress after the removal of contact with asbestos. Asbestosis can increase the risk of developing pleural mesothelioma, a type of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs.

Therefore, the feature that is not suggestive of asbestosis is option A, which states that it occurs within five years of exposure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
