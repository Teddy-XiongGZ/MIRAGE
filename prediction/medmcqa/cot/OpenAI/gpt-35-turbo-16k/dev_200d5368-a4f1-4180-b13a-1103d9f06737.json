    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zenker's diverticulum is a condition characterized by the formation of a pouch or sac in the wall of the esophagus, specifically in the area known as the pharyngoesophageal junction. To diagnose Zenker's diverticulum, several investigations can be considered. The most commonly used investigation of choice is barium swallow, also known as a barium esophagram. This test involves swallowing a liquid containing barium, which coats the esophagus and allows for visualization of any abnormalities, including the presence of a diverticulum. Endoscopy can also be used to visualize the esophagus and detect the presence of a diverticulum. However, it may not be as sensitive as a barium swallow in detecting smaller diverticula. Esophageal manometry is a test used to assess the function and motility of the esophagus and is not specific for diagnosing Zenker's diverticulum. CECT (contrast-enhanced computed tomography) may be used in certain cases to further evaluate the diverticulum and its associated complications, but it is not typically the initial investigation of choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
