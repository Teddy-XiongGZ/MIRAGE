    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mandibular molars are the molars located in the lower jaw. Accessory canals are small channels that can be found within the root of a tooth. These canals can contain blood vessels, nerves, or other tissues. To determine the number of patterns of accessory canals in mandibular molars, we need to consider the anatomy of these teeth. Mandibular molars typically have two roots, a mesial root and a distal root. Each root can have its own pattern of accessory canals. Therefore, the total number of patterns of accessory canals in mandibular molars is the sum of the patterns in the mesial and distal roots.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
