    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, insulin requirement increases due to hormonal changes and increased insulin resistance. Oral hypoglycemic agents like sulphonylureas are not recommended during pregnancy as they can cross the placenta and potentially harm the fetus. Therefore, it is necessary to shift the pregnant, diabetic female from oral hypoglycemics to insulin. Insulin does not cross the placenta, so option A is true. Tolbutamide is a sulphonylurea and can cross the placenta, so option C is true. However, option D is incorrect as tolbutamide does not cause pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
