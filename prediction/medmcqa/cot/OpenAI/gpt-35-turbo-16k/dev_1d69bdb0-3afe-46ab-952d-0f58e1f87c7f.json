    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the force applied to cause root movement, we need to consider the principles of orthodontics. The force applied should be controlled and gentle to avoid damaging the roots or surrounding tissues. Additionally, the force should be continuous rather than intermittent to ensure consistent and predictable movement. Extra-oral forces are typically used for anchorage purposes and not for directly causing root movement. Torque or moment refers to the rotational force applied to the tooth, which may be necessary in certain cases but is not the primary force for root movement. Therefore, the most appropriate choice for the force applied to cause root movement is D. Gentle action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
