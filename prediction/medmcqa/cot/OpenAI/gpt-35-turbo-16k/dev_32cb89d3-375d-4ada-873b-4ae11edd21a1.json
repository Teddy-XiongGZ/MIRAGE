    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maxillary 1st molars typically have three roots: two buccal roots and one palatal root. However, in some cases, two palatal roots can be found. To determine the percentage of maxillary 1st molars with two palatal roots, we need to consider the prevalence of this variation. Step 1: Determine the prevalence of maxillary 1st molars with two palatal roots. Step 2: Express the prevalence as a percentage. Answer choice A (1-4%): This range suggests that 1-4% of maxillary 1st molars have two palatal roots. Answer choice B (2-10%): This range suggests that 2-10% of maxillary 1st molars have two palatal roots. Answer choice C (0-1%): This range suggests that 0-1% of maxillary 1st molars have two palatal roots. Answer choice D (Two palatal roots are never found): This choice suggests that two palatal roots are never found in maxillary 1st molars. Based on the step-by-step thinking, the answer choice that aligns with the prevalence of maxillary 1st molars with two palatal roots is not provided. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Not provided\"}"
