    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by low levels of iron in the body. To determine iron deficiency anemia, several laboratory tests are commonly used. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. In iron deficiency anemia, ferritin levels are typically low. TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity) measures the amount of iron that can be bound by transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the blood. In iron deficiency anemia, TIBC levels are usually high as the body tries to increase its iron-binding capacity. Serum iron measures the amount of iron in the blood. In iron deficiency anemia, serum iron levels are typically low. Transferrin saturation is the percentage of transferrin that is bound to iron. In iron deficiency anemia, transferrin saturation is usually low. Based on this information, the answer is D. Transferrin saturation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
