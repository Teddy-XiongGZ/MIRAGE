    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary effect of tongue movement can be determined by considering the anatomical structures that are directly influenced by the movement of the tongue. - The palatoglossus arch is a muscle that connects the tongue to the soft palate. It helps in elevating the back of the tongue and closing off the nasopharynx during swallowing. While tongue movement can indirectly affect the palatoglossus arch, it is not the primary effect of tongue movement. - The facial musculature includes various muscles that control facial expressions, such as smiling, frowning, and raising the eyebrows. Tongue movement does not have a direct effect on the facial musculature. - The lips are primarily controlled by the orbicularis oris muscle, which encircles the mouth. Tongue movement can have a direct effect on the position and movement of the lips, especially during speech and swallowing. - The cheeks are primarily controlled by the buccinator muscle, which helps in compressing the cheeks during chewing and blowing. Tongue movement can indirectly affect the cheeks, especially during swallowing and certain speech sounds. However, it is not the primary effect of tongue movement. Based on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is C. Lips.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
