    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in managing an Ellis class-III fracture in a 9-year-old child after 24 hours is to take a radiograph to assess the extent of the fracture and any associated damage to the tooth and surrounding structures. This will help in determining the appropriate treatment approach. Cvek's pulpotomy is a common treatment option for Ellis class-III fractures in young permanent teeth with vital pulps. It involves removing the coronal pulp tissue and placing a medicament to promote healing and preserve the vitality of the remaining pulp. Pulpectomy is typically performed when the pulp is non-vital or infected. Indirect pulp capping is a conservative treatment option for deep carious lesions where the pulp is not exposed.

However, in the case of an Ellis class-III fracture, where the pulp is exposed, immediate intervention is required.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
