    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's evaluate each statement one by one:\\n\\n1. The statement says that CPR can be given irrespective of rib fracture. This statement is true because CPR is a life-saving technique that should be performed regardless of any rib fractures.\\n\\n2. The statement says that the ratio of chest compressions to breaths in adult CPR is 30:2 to 15:2 even if a second rescuer is present. This statement is false because when a second rescuer is present, the ratio changes to 15:2.\\n\\n3. The statement says that in infants, the ratio changes from 30:2 to 15:2 when a second rescuer arrives. This statement is true because the ratio does change to 15:2 in infants when a second rescuer is present.\\n\\n4. The statement says that the chest compression rate is 100-120 per minute in adults and 90 per minute in infants. This statement is true because these are the recommended compression rates for each age group.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, the correct answer is C. a, c, d are true & b is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
