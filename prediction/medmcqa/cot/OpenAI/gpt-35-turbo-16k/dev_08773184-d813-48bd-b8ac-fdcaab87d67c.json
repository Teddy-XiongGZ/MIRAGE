    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by four abnormalities in the heart's structure. One of these abnormalities is a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is a hole between the two lower chambers of the heart. In order to compensate for the VSD and improve blood flow, children with tetralogy of Fallot often adopt specific positions. Supine position refers to lying flat on the back. Prone position refers to lying flat on the stomach. Squatting position refers to sitting with the knees bent and the thighs resting on the calves. Leaning forwards position refers to leaning the upper body forward. To determine the correct position for a child with tetralogy of Fallot, we need to consider the physiological changes that occur in this condition. The VSD allows oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to mix with deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle, resulting in decreased oxygen levels in the systemic circulation. This can lead to cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin) and hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood). In order to improve blood flow and increase oxygenation, children with tetralogy of Fallot often adopt a squatting position. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which helps to redirect blood flow from the right ventricle to the systemic circulation. This position also helps to decrease the amount of blood shunting through the VSD, improving oxygenation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Squatting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
