Karyolysis: Karyolysis is the dissolution or fading of the nucleus due to enzymatic degradation of the chromatin. This option seems to be a possible answer.\\n\\nC. Karyorhexis: Karyorhexis is the fragmentation or breaking up of the nucleus into smaller pieces. It does not refer to the disappearance of nuclear chromatin.\\n\\nD. None: This option implies that there is no specific term for the disappearance of nuclear chromatin, which is not accurate.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is B. Karyolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
