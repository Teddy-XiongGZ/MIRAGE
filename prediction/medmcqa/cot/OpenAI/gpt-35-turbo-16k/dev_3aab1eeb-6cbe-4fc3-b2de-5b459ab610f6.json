    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At day 3 of presentation in a suspected patient of dengue, the viral culture and isolation in C6/36 cell line is not an acceptable investigation. This is because viral culture and isolation usually takes several days to yield results and may not be practical for early diagnosis. ELISA for antibody against dengue virus can be done to detect the presence of antibodies against the virus, which usually becomes positive after a few days of infection. NS1 antigen detection is a rapid test that can detect the presence of the NS1 antigen, a protein produced by the dengue virus, and is commonly used for early diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Viral culture and isolation in C6/36 cell line is not an acceptable investigation at day 3 of presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
