    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microcephaly refers to a condition where a baby's head is smaller than expected. It can be caused by various factors, including genetic abnormalities, infections, and exposure to toxins. To determine which disorder of the mother leads to microcephaly in the baby, we need to consider the potential causes of microcephaly associated with each disorder. \\n\\na) SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus): SLE is an autoimmune disorder that can affect various organs, including the brain. While it can cause neurological complications, microcephaly is not a commonly reported feature of SLE.\\n\\nb) Hepatitis A: Hepatitis A is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver. It is unlikely to directly cause microcephaly in the baby.\\n\\nc) Phenylketonuria: Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. If left untreated, it can lead to intellectual disabilities, but microcephaly is not a characteristic feature of this disorder.\\n\\nd) Rubella: Rubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection that can cause various birth defects if a pregnant woman becomes infected. Microcephaly is one of the potential complications associated with rubella infection during pregnancy.\\n\\nConsidering the above information, the correct answer is D. ac, as SLE and Rubella are the two disorders that can potentially lead to microcephaly in the baby.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. ac\"}"
