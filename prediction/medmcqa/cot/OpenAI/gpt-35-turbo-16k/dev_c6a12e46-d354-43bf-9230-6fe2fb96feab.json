    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rapid onset of action seen by local anesthesia in small nerve endings can be explained by the high ratio of surface area to the volume of small nerve fibers. When local anesthesia is administered, it diffuses across the nerve membrane and blocks sodium channels, preventing the generation and conduction of action potentials. Small nerve fibers have a higher surface area to volume ratio compared to larger nerve fibers, which allows for a greater concentration of the local anesthetic to come into contact with the nerve membrane, leading to a faster onset of action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
