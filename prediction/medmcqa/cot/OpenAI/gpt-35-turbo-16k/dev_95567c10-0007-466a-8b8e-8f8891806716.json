    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Purkinje fibers are specialized cardiac muscle fibers that conduct electrical impulses through the ventricles of the heart, allowing for coordinated contraction. They are part of the cardiac conduction system and are responsible for transmitting electrical signals from the bundle of His to the ventricular myocardium. Therefore, Purkinje fibers do not project to any of the structures mentioned in the options. They are specifically involved in the electrical conduction within the heart and not in the central nervous system.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
