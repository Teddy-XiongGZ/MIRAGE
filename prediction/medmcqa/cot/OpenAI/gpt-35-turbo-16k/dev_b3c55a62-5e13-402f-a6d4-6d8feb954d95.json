    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The largest cusp refers to the largest pointed or elevated area on a tooth. To determine the largest cusp, we need to consider the size and position of the cusps on the given teeth. A. Mesiolingual cusp of upper 1st molar: This is the cusp located on the inner side of the upper first molar. It is not typically the largest cusp on this tooth. B. Mesiolingual cusp of Upper 2nd molar: This is the cusp located on the inner side of the upper second molar. It is not typically the largest cusp on this tooth. C. Buccolingual cusp of Upper 1st molar: This is the cusp located on the outer side of the upper first molar. It is often the largest cusp on this tooth. D. Buccolingual cusp of lower 2nd molar: This is the cusp located on the outer side of the lower second molar. It is not typically the largest cusp on this tooth. Based on the information provided, the largest cusp is most likely the buccolingual cusp of the upper 1st molar (Choice C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
