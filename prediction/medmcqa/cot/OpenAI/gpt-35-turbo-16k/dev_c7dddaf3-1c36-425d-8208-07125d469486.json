    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The deep cervical fascia is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds and separates the structures in the neck. It is composed of multiple layers. The deepest layer of the deep cervical fascia is known as the prevertebral fascia. This layer is located posteriorly and covers the vertebral column and associated muscles. The carotid sheath is a separate layer within the deep cervical fascia that contains the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve.

The temporal fascia is not a part of the deep cervical fascia, but rather a separate fascial layer that covers the temporal region of the head.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
