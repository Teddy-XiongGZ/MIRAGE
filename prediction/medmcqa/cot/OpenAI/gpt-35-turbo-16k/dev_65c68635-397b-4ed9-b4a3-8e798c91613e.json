    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, the body undergoes various physiological changes to support the growing fetus. One of these changes is an increase in cardiac output, which refers to the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute. Cardiac output gradually increases throughout pregnancy, reaching its peak in the third trimester. To determine when the cardiac output increases 30 to 40%, we need to identify the corresponding time frame. Option A: 20th week of pregnancy - This is relatively early in the second trimester, and it is unlikely that the cardiac output has increased by 30 to 40% at this point. Option B: 22 weeks of pregnancy - Similar to option A, this is still early in the second trimester, and it is unlikely that the cardiac output has increased by 30 to 40% at this point. Option C: 24 weeks of pregnancy - This is still in the second trimester, but closer to the third trimester. It is possible that the cardiac output has increased by 30 to 40% by this point. Option D: 28 weeks of gestation - This is well into the third trimester, and it is likely that the cardiac output has increased by 30 to 40% by this point. Based on the information provided, the most likely answer is option D, 28 weeks of gestation, as this is when the cardiac output is expected to have increased by 30 to 40%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
