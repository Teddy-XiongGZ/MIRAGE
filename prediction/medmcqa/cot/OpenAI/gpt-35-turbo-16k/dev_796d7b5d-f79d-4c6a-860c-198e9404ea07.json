    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cataract is a condition characterized by the clouding of the lens in the eye, which leads to vision impairment. High molecular weight (HM) proteins are known to accumulate in cataractous lenses. To determine which HM proteins are specifically seen in cataractous lenses in humans, we need to analyze the given options. Option A states HM 1 and 2, Option B states HM 2 and 3, Option C states HM 2 and 4, and Option D states HM 3 and 4. Since we are looking for the high molecular weight proteins specifically seen in cataractous lenses in humans, we can eliminate Option D, as it includes HM 3, which is not specific to humans. To further narrow down the options, we need to consider the proteins that are unique to cataractous lenses. Based on the given options, Option C (HM 2 and 4) is the most likely choice, as it includes HM 2, which is commonly associated with cataract formation. However, without additional information, it is not possible to definitively determine the correct answer. Therefore, the answer choice is: C. HM 2 and 4.\"}"
