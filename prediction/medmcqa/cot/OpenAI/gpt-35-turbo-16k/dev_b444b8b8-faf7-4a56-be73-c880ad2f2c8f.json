    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mandibular stabilization is the process of keeping the jaw stable during certain activities such as swallowing. The facial nerve is responsible for the contraction of the muscles involved in mandibular stabilization. To determine in which condition mandibular stabilization is not governed by facial nerve contraction, we need to consider the function of the facial nerve in each option. \\n\\nA. Infantile swallow: In infants, the facial nerve is responsible for the coordination of swallowing, including mandibular stabilization. \\nB. Mature swallow: In adults, the facial nerve continues to play a role in mandibular stabilization during swallowing. \\nC. Complex tongue thrusting: Although tongue thrusting involves the movement of the tongue, mandibular stabilization is still governed by the facial nerve contraction. \\nD. Retained infantile swallow: This condition refers to the persistence of infantile swallowing patterns in older individuals. Since infantile swallowing is governed by the facial nerve, mandibular stabilization in retained infantile swallow is also governed by facial nerve contraction. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Retained infantile swallow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
