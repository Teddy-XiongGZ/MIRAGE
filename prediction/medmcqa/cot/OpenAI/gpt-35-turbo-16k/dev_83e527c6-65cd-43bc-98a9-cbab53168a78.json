    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In noncompetitive antagonism, the antagonist binds to a different site on the receptor or enzyme than the agonist, resulting in a decrease in the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction. This is because the antagonist prevents the agonist from binding and activating the receptor or enzyme fully. However, the antagonist does not affect the affinity of the agonist for the receptor or enzyme, so the Michaelis constant (Km) value remains unchanged. Therefore, the correct statement is: C. Vmax decreased; Km value normal\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
