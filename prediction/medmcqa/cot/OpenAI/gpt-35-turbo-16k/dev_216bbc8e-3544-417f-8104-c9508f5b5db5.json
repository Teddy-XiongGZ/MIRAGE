    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A March fracture is a stress fracture that commonly occurs in the 2nd metatarsal bone of the foot. To determine which part of the 2nd metatarsal is involved, we need to understand the anatomy of the bone. The metatarsal bone consists of several parts, including the head, neck, shaft, and base. The head is the rounded part at the end of the bone, the neck is the narrower portion just below the head, the shaft is the long middle portion of the bone, and the base is the wider part at the other end of the bone. In the case of a March fracture, it typically involves the shaft of the 2nd metatarsal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Shaft\"}"
