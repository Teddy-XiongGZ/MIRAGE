    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dental papilla is a structure that forms during tooth development. It is responsible for the formation of the dentin and pulp of the tooth. The nerve fibers in the dental papilla are derived from the trigeminal nerve. In the bud stage of tooth development, the dental papilla is not yet formed.

Therefore, the first nerve fiber present in the vicinity of the dental papilla would be in the cap stage of tooth development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
