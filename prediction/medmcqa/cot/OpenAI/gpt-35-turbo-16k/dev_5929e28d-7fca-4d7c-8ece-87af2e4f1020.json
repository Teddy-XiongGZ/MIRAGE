    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tooth structure cutting is a process that involves the application of forces to the tooth. Before the tooth structure can be cut, there needs to be crack propagation. Crack propagation occurs when the forces applied to the tooth exceed its tensile strength, causing the tooth to fracture. Brittle fracture is a type of fracture that occurs in materials with low ductility, such as ceramics. Ductile fracture, on the other hand, occurs in materials with high ductility, such as metals. Shear fracture is a type of fracture that occurs when forces are applied parallel to the plane of the material. In the context of tooth structure cutting, the forces involved are primarily tensile forces. Therefore, the crack propagation that occurs before tooth structure cutting is most likely due to brittle fracture. So, the correct answer is A. Brittle fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
