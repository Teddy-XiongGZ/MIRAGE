    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how much hone can be stretched at a time before it fractures, we need to consider the material properties of hone. Hone is a type of rock composed mainly of the mineral calcite. Calcite has a low tensile strength, meaning it is not very resistant to being stretched or pulled. Generally, rocks like hone have a very low elongation at fracture, which means they can only stretch a small percentage of their original length before fracturing. Based on this information, we can eliminate options C and D (6% and 8%) as they are too high. Now, we are left with options A (1%) and B (2%). Since hone is a relatively brittle material, it is likely to have a low elongation at fracture. Therefore, the most reasonable choice would be option A (1%), as it represents a smaller percentage of stretch before fracture compared to option B (2%). Therefore, the answer is A. 1%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
