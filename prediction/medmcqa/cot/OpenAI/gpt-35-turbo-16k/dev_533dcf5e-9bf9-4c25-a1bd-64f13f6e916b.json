    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common tumor of the mediastinum, we need to consider the different types of tumors that can occur in this region. The mediastinum is divided into three compartments: anterior, middle, and posterior. The most common tumor of the mediastinum varies depending on the compartment. In the anterior compartment, thymoma is the most common tumor. In the middle compartment, neurogenic tumors, such as neurofibroma or ganglioneuroma, are the most common. In the posterior compartment, lymphoma is the most common tumor. Metastatic tumors can occur in any compartment, but they are not the most common overall. Therefore, based on the given options, the most common tumor of the mediastinum is B. Thymoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
