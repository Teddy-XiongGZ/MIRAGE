    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydrocephalus refers to the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain, leading to an enlargement of the head. Antenatal detection refers to the identification of hydrocephalus before birth. To detect hydrocephalus antenately, we need a non-invasive imaging modality that can visualize the fetal brain. A. X-ray abdomen: X-ray imaging is not suitable for visualizing the brain structures, so it is not the best option for detecting hydrocephalus antenately. B. Amniocentesis: Amniocentesis is a procedure where a small amount of amniotic fluid is extracted for genetic testing. It is not used for directly visualizing the fetal brain, so it is not the best option for detecting hydrocephalus antenately. C. Clinical examination: Clinical examination involves physical examination of the mother's abdomen to assess the size and shape of the fetal head. While it can provide some clues, it is not the most accurate method for detecting hydrocephalus antenately. D. Ultrasonography: Ultrasonography is a commonly used imaging modality during pregnancy. It uses sound waves to create images of the fetus and can accurately visualize the fetal brain structures. Therefore, ultrasonography is the best option for detecting hydrocephalus antenately. Based on the above reasoning, the answer choice is D. Ultrasonography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
