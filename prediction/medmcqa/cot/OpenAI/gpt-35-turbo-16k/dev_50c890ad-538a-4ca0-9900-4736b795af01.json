    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital ossicular dysfunction refers to abnormalities or malformations of the ossicles in the middle ear that are present at birth. To determine the most common type of congenital ossicular dysfunction, we need to consider the prevalence of each option. A. Isolated stapes defect: This refers to a defect or malformation of the stapes bone. While stapes defects can occur, they are not the most common type of congenital ossicular dysfunction. B. Stapes defect with fixation of footplate and lenticular process involvement: This option describes a stapes defect with additional involvement of the footplate and lenticular process. Again, while this can occur, it is not the most common type. C. Defective lenticular process of incus: This refers to a defect or malformation of the lenticular process of the incus bone. Based on the options provided, the most common type of congenital ossicular dysfunction is likely option C, defective lenticular process of incus. This is because defects or malformations of the incus bone are more commonly observed compared to isolated stapes defects or stapes defects with additional involvement. Therefore, the answer is C. Defective lenticular process of incus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
