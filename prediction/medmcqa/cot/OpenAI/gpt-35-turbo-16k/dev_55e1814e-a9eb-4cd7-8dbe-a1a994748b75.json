    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the working length in endodontics, radiographic methods are commonly used. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Grossman technique: The Grossman technique is not a radiographic method for working length determination. It is a technique used for root canal filling.\\n\\nB. Ingels technique: The Ingels technique is also not a radiographic method for working length determination. It is a technique used for root canal preparation.\\n\\nC. Bregman technique: The Bregman technique is not a commonly used radiographic method for working length determination.\\n\\nD. None of the above: Since none of the options mentioned are commonly used radiographic methods for working length determination, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
