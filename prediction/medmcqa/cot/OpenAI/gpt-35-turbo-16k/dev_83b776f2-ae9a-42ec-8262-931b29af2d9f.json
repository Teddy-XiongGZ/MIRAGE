    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intraventricular hemorrhage is a common complication in premature infants. Abdominal distention and pneumatosis intestinalis are clinical and radiographic findings associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is staged based on the severity of the disease. The staging system includes three stages (1, 2, and 3) and each stage is further divided into subcategories (a and b). Stage 1 is characterized by mild disease, stage 2 is moderate disease, and stage 3 is severe disease. Pneumatosis intestinalis is a radiographic finding seen in stage 2 or higher NEC. Since the X-ray abdomen showed pneumatosis poalis, the stage of NEC would be at least stage 2. Among the given choices, the closest match is 2a.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
