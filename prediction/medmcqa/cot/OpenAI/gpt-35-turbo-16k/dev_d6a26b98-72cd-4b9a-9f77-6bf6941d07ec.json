    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Beta 1,3 Glucan test is used to detect the presence of fungal infections. It measures the levels of a specific type of sugar called beta 1,3 glucan, which is found in the cell walls of many fungi. The test is positive when there is a significant amount of beta 1,3 glucan in the bloodstream, indicating a fungal infection. Aspergillus, Candida, Mucormycosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii are all types of fungi that can cause infections in humans. Therefore, it is important to determine which of these fungi would not result in a positive Beta 1,3 Glucan test. Aspergillus is a type of fungus that commonly causes lung infections in people with weakened immune systems. It is known to produce beta 1,3 glucan, so a Beta 1,3 Glucan test would likely be positive in the presence of an Aspergillus infection. Candida is a type of yeast that can cause infections in various parts of the body, including the mouth, throat, and genital area. Like Aspergillus, Candida is known to produce beta 1,3 glucan, so a Beta 1,3 Glucan test would likely be positive in the presence of a Candida infection. Mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection that primarily affects people with weakened immune systems. It is caused by a group of fungi called Mucorales. These fungi do not produce beta 1,3 glucan, so a Beta 1,3 Glucan test would likely be negative in the presence of a Mucormycosis infection. Pneumocystis Jirovecii is a fungus that can cause a severe lung infection called Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. Pneumocystis Jirovecii does produce beta 1,3 glucan, so a Beta 1,3 Glucan test would likely be positive in the presence of a Pneumocystis Jirovecii infection. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Mucormycosis, as it is the only option that would not result in a positive Beta 1,3 Glucan test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
