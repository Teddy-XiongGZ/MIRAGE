    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Submandibular calculus refers to the formation of a stone or calculus in the submandibular salivary gland duct. To remove the calculus, the obstruction in the duct needs to be cleared. Let's evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. Dilatation of the duct: This option involves widening or stretching the duct. While this may help in some cases, it may not be sufficient to remove the calculus completely.\\n\\nB. Excision of the opening of duct: This option involves removing the opening of the duct. However, this would not address the calculus present within the duct.\\n\\nC. Removal of the gland: This option involves removing the entire submandibular salivary gland. While this would eliminate the calculus, it is a more invasive procedure and may not be necessary if the calculus can be removed without removing the gland.\\n\\nD. Incision of the duct and removal of calculus: This option involves making an incision in the duct and directly removing the calculus. This is the most appropriate and commonly used method to remove submandibular calculus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
