    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During ridge split or bone spreading, the bone is intentionally fractured to create space for implant placement. This procedure involves separating the buccal and lingual plates of the bone. Given this information, let's analyze the potential complications: \\n\\nA. Dehiscence: Dehiscence refers to the opening of a wound or incision. While it can occur during ridge split, it is not the most common complication. \\n\\nB. Facial plate splitting: This refers to the separation or fracture of the facial plate of the bone. Since ridge split involves separating the buccal and lingual plates, it is possible for the facial plate to split. \\n\\nC. Implant micro movement: This refers to the slight movement or instability of the implant. While it can occur during any implant procedure, it is not specific to ridge split or bone spreading. \\n\\nD. Poor position of implant: This refers to the implant being placed in an incorrect position. While it is a possible complication, it is not specific to ridge split or bone spreading. \\n\\nBased on the information provided, the most common complication during ridge split or bone spreading is likely B. Facial plate splitting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
