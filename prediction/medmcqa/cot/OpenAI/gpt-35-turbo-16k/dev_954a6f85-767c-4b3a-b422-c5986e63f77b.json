    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Excessive occlusal forces can cause damage to the periodontium, which includes the supporting structures of the teeth such as the bone and gums. In cases of normal periodontium with normal height of bone (option A), excessive occlusal forces can still be superimposed and cause damage. Similarly, in cases of normal periodontium with reduced height of bone (option B), excessive occlusal forces can also be superimposed and cause further damage. However, in cases of marginal periodontitis with reduced height of bone (option C), the periodontium is already compromised and the bone height is reduced. In such cases, excessive occlusal forces may not be superimposed as the periodontium is already weakened. Therefore, the correct answer is option C. Marginal periodontitis with reduced height of bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
