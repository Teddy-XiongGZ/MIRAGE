    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pulp is the soft, innermost part of a tooth that contains blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue. To determine which structure is not found in a living pulp, we need to consider the components of the pulp. A. Collagen fibers: Collagen fibers are a major component of connective tissue, which is found in the pulp. Therefore, collagen fibers are present in a living pulp. B. Haversian fibers: Haversian fibers, also known as osteons, are found in compact bone tissue, not in the pulp. Therefore, Haversian fibers are not found in a living pulp. C. Non-myelinated nerve fibers: Nerve fibers are an essential component of the pulp, as they provide sensory innervation to the tooth. Therefore, non-myelinated nerve fibers are present in a living pulp. D. Reticulum: Reticulum refers to a network of fibers, which can be found in various tissues. However, it is not a specific component of the pulp. Therefore, reticulum is not found in a living pulp. Based on the above analysis, the structure that is not found in a living pulp is B. Haversian fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
