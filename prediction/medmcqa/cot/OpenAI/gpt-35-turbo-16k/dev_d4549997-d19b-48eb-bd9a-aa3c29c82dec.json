    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor is a dental anomaly known as talon cusp. It is a rare condition that can occur in isolation or be associated with certain syndromes. To determine which syndrome is not associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor, we need to evaluate each option. \\n\\nA. Mohr's syndrome: Mohr's syndrome, also known as oral-facial-digital syndrome type II, is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in the development of the face, oral cavity, and digits. It is not specifically associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor. \\n\\nB. Sturge-Weber Syndrome: Sturge-Weber Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by a port-wine stain birthmark on the face and abnormalities in the brain and eyes. It is not specifically associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor. \\n\\nC. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome: Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and toes. It is not specifically associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor. \\n\\nD. Proteus Syndrome: Proteus Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth of tissues and organs. It is not specifically associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor. \\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is D. Proteus Syndrome, as it is not associated with an extra cusp on a maxillary central incisor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
