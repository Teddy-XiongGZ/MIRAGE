    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find out the significance of difference in height of children between 2 classes in a school, we need to compare the means of the two groups. Since we are comparing two independent groups, we should use an unpaired test. ANOVA is used to compare means of more than two groups, so it is not applicable in this case. Chisquare test is used to compare categorical variables, not continuous variables like height. Coefficient of variance is a measure of variability, not a test for significance. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Unpaired test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
