    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine in which scenario viral load done by Real Time PCR is of no role in investigative procedures, we need to consider the characteristics of each scenario and the role of viral load testing. Real Time PCR is a sensitive and specific method used to quantify the amount of viral genetic material (viral load) in a patient's sample. It is commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of viral infections. A. Person with hepatitis B on Tenofovir therapy: In this scenario, viral load testing is important to monitor the response to antiviral therapy and assess the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, viral load done by Real Time PCR is of role in investigative procedures. B. HSV causing temporal encephalitis: Real Time PCR is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. It can detect the presence of HSV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and help confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, viral load done by Real Time PCR is of role in investigative procedures. C. BK virus in patient of allograft renal transplant: BK virus can cause significant complications in patients who have undergone renal transplantation. Viral load testing by Real Time PCR is used to monitor the level of BK virus in the blood or urine of transplant recipients. It helps in the early detection of viral reactivation or infection, and guides the management of immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, viral load done by Real Time PCR is of role in investigative procedures. D. CMV PCR in blood of patient of liver transplant: CMV infection is a common complication in patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation, including liver transplant. Real Time PCR is the preferred method for monitoring CMV viral load in the blood of transplant recipients. It helps in the early detection of CMV reactivation or infection, and guides the management of antiviral therapy. Therefore, viral load done by Real Time PCR is of role in investigative procedures. Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that viral load done by Real Time PCR is of role in investigative procedures in all the given scenarios.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
