    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A non-working contact is a contact between teeth that occurs during lateral or protrusive movements of the jaw. It is designed to prevent excessive forces on the teeth and supporting structures. In natural dentition, non-working contacts are necessary to distribute forces evenly during chewing and prevent damage to the teeth. Therefore, natural dentition is not a situation where a non-working contact is not needed. Complete dentures are artificial teeth replacements that are not supported by natural teeth. Since there are no natural teeth present, there is no need for non-working contacts in complete dentures. Distal extension RPDs (removable partial dentures) are partial dentures that have artificial teeth supported by natural teeth. In this case, non-working contacts are necessary to distribute forces evenly and prevent damage to the supporting teeth. Therefore, distal extension RPDs are also not a situation where a non-working contact is not needed. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is D. None.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
