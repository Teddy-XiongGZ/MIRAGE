    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Jaundice with 50% direct bilirubin suggests a problem with the conjugation of bilirubin. Rotor syndrome and Gilbert syndrome are both conditions that can cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not direct hyperbilirubinemia. Glucuronyl transferase deficiency is another term for Gilbert syndrome, so it can be ruled out as well. Primary biliary cirrhosis is a condition that can cause direct hyperbilirubinemia, but it typically presents with other abnormalities in liver function tests (LFTs). Since the other LFTs are normal in this case, the most likely diagnosis is A. Rotor syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
