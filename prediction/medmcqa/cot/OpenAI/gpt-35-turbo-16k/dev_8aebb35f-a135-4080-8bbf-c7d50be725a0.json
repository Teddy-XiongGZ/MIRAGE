    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Penicillinase is an enzyme produced by some bacteria that can inactivate penicillin antibiotics. Therefore, penicillinase-resistant penicillins are those that are not easily inactivated by penicillinase. To determine which one of the given options is penicillinase resistant, we need to consider their chemical structures and properties. Amoxycillin and ampicillin are both aminopenicillins, which are susceptible to penicillinase. Penicillin G is a natural penicillin and is also susceptible to penicillinase. Cloxacillin, on the other hand, is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin. It has a bulky side chain that prevents penicillinase from binding to the active site of the antibiotic, thus making it resistant to inactivation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Cloxacillin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
