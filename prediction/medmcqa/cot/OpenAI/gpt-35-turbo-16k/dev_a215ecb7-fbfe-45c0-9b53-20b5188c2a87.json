    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reamers and files are both cutting tools used in metalworking. To determine the difference between their physical characteristics, we can compare the cross-section, number of flutes, and groove design. A. The cross-section of reamers is typically cylindrical, while files have a triangular cross-section. This means that option A is correct. B. The number of flutes refers to the number of cutting edges on the tool. Reamers and files can have different numbers of flutes, so this does not determine the difference between them. C. The statement that reamers have more flutes in the blade is not necessarily true. The number of flutes can vary depending on the specific tool and its intended use. D. The presence of superficial grooves to produce flutes in a double helix design is not a characteristic of reamers or files. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is A. The cross-section of reamers is square, while files have a triangular cross-section.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
