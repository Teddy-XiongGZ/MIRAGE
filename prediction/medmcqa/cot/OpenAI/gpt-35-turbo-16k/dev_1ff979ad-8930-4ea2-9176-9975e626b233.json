    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vitamins are organic compounds that are essential for the normal functioning of the body. They can be obtained from food sources or synthesized in the body. To determine which of the given options is synthesized in vivo by humans, we need to consider the body's ability to produce the vitamin. A. Niacin: Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, can be synthesized in the body from the amino acid tryptophan. However, the conversion of tryptophan to niacin is not very efficient, and most of the niacin requirement is met through dietary sources. B. Pantothenic acid: Pantothenic acid, also known as vitamin B5, is an essential nutrient that cannot be synthesized in the body. It must be obtained from dietary sources. C. Cyanocobalamin: Cyanocobalamin, also known as vitamin B12, is not synthesized in the body by humans. It is produced by certain bacteria and can only be obtained from animal-based foods or supplements. D. Folic acid: Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is not synthesized in the body by humans. It is obtained from dietary sources, such as leafy green vegetables, legumes, and fortified foods. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Cyanocobalamin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
