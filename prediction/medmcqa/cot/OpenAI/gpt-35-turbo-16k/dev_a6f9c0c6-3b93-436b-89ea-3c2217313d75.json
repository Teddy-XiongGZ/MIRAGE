    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If resin is packed in sandy stage, it means that the resin has not been properly mixed and there are air bubbles trapped within the material. This can lead to porosity in the processed denture, as the air bubbles create voids in the resin. Porosity can result in a weaker denture and can also affect the appearance of the denture, causing an inhomogeneous color. Distortion, on the other hand, is not directly related to packing the resin in sandy stage. Increased strength is also unlikely as the presence of air bubbles weakens the material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Porosity\"}"
