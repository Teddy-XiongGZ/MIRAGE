    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metabolic disorders involve abnormalities in the body's metabolism, which can affect various biochemical pathways. To investigate metabolic disorders, we need a method that can analyze and quantify the levels of different metabolites in the body. Western blot is a technique used to detect specific proteins, but it is not suitable for analyzing metabolites. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a method used to amplify and detect specific DNA sequences, so it is not the best choice for investigating metabolic disorders. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate and analyze DNA, RNA, or proteins based on their size and charge, but it may not provide detailed information about specific metabolites. Tandem mass spectrometry, on the other hand, is a powerful analytical technique that can accurately measure the levels of various metabolites in a sample. It is commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of metabolic disorders. Therefore, the best investigation for metabolic disorders is B. Tandem mass spectrometry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
