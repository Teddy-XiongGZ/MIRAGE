    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient developed breathlessness, pruritus, and urticaria after taking NSAIDs, which suggests an allergic reaction. The low blood pressure and rales on chest examination indicate an anaphylactic reaction. The initial management of anaphylaxis includes ensuring a patent airway, providing oxygenation, and supporting respiratory function. Therefore, option C (Early respiratory support and oxygenation) should be used for initial management. Crystalloids infusion (option A) can be used to maintain blood pressure, steroids (option B) can help reduce inflammation and prevent further allergic reactions, and adrenaline (option D) can be used as a second-line treatment if the patient does not respond to initial management. However, option C is the most appropriate initial management choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
