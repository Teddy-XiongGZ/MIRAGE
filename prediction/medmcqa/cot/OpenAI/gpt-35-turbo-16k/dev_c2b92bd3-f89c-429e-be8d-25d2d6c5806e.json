    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Forward scatter in flow cytometry is used to assess the size of cells. When a cell passes through the laser beam in flow cytometry, the light is scattered in different directions. Forward scatter refers to the light that is scattered in the same direction as the laser beam. The intensity of the forward scatter signal is proportional to the size of the cell. Therefore, forward scatter can be used to determine the size of cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
