    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to Tweed, inclination of lower incisors by 1\u00b0 labially increases the arch length by a certain amount. To determine the increase in arch length, we need to refer to the Tweed's formula. According to Tweed's formula, the increase in arch length is equal to the inclination of the lower incisors multiplied by a constant factor. The constant factor is typically given as 0.5 mm per degree of inclination. Therefore, to find the increase in arch length for an inclination of 1\u00b0 labially, we can multiply 1\u00b0 by 0.5 mm per degree.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
