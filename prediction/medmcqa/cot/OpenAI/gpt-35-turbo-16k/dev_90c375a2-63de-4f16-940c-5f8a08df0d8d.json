    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ideal denture base material should not have certain characteristics. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Sufficient strength: This is actually a desirable characteristic for a denture base material, as it needs to withstand the forces of chewing and biting. Therefore, this option is not correct.\\n\\nB. Dense and non-irritating surface: This is also a desirable characteristic for a denture base material, as it should be smooth and comfortable for the patient. Therefore, this option is not correct.\\n\\nC. High specific gravity: High specific gravity means that the material is heavy. This is not an ideal characteristic for a denture base material, as it can make the denture uncomfortable for the patient to wear. Therefore, this option is a possible correct answer.\\n\\nD. Esthetically acceptable: This is also a desirable characteristic for a denture base material, as it should blend in with the patient's natural teeth and gums. Therefore, this option is not correct.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. High specific gravity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
