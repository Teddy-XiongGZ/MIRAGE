    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Massive blood transfusion can lead to a complication known as citrate toxicity. Citrate is an anticoagulant commonly used in blood transfusions to prevent clotting. However, when large amounts of blood are transfused, the citrate can accumulate in the body and cause metabolic alkalosis. This occurs because citrate is metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate, which increases the levels of bicarbonate in the blood, leading to alkalosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Metabolic alkalosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
