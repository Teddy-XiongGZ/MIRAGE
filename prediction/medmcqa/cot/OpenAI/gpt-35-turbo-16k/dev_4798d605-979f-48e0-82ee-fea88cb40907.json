    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Korff's fibres are collagen fibers that are seen in reactionary dentin. They are formed in response to injury or irritation to the pulp. Mantle dentin is the first layer of dentin formed during tooth development, and it does not contain Korff's fibres. Secondary dentin is formed after the completion of root formation and does not contain Korff's fibres either. Indeed dermal tubules are not related to dentin formation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Reactionary dentin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
