    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The visual pathway consists of three main neurons: the first order neuron, the second order neuron, and the third order neuron. The first order neuron is responsible for transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. The photoreceptor cells, which include the rods and cones, are the cells in the retina that detect light and initiate the visual signal. Therefore, the photoreceptor cells can be considered as the first order neuron of the visual pathway. The bipolar neurons are the second order neurons in the visual pathway, as they receive input from the photoreceptor cells and transmit the signal to the third order neurons. The lateral geniculate body is a structure in the thalamus that receives input from the bipolar neurons and relays the visual information to the visual cortex in the brain. Therefore, the correct answer is D. all of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
