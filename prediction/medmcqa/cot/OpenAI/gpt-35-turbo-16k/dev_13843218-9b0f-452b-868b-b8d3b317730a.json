    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel rods are the structural units of enamel, which is the outermost layer of the tooth. Hydroxyapatite crystals are the main component of enamel. The arrangement of hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel rods is important for the strength and durability of the enamel. A. In center orientation of hydroxyapatite crystal is 0 degree: This statement suggests that the hydroxyapatite crystals in the center of the enamel rods have a 0-degree orientation. B. Orientation of hydroxyapatite crystals at periphery is 45 degree: This statement suggests that the hydroxyapatite crystals at the periphery of the enamel rods have a 45-degree orientation. C. Both: This option suggests that both statements A and B are true. D. None: This option suggests that neither statement A nor B is true. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the natural arrangement of hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel rods. The hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel rods are arranged in a keyhole-shaped pattern, with the crystals at the center having a 0-degree orientation and the crystals at the periphery having a 45-degree orientation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
