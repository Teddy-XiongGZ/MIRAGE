    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Addison's disease is a condition characterized by the insufficient production of adrenal hormones. To determine which gland is related to Addison's disease, we need to identify the gland responsible for producing adrenal hormones. The adrenal medulla produces adrenaline and noradrenaline, which are not directly related to Addison's disease. The post pituitary gland produces hormones such as oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone, which are also not related to Addison's disease. The parathyroid gland produces parathyroid hormone, which regulates calcium levels in the blood and is not directly related to Addison's disease. The adrenal cortex, on the other hand, is responsible for producing cortisol and aldosterone, which are the hormones affected in Addison's disease. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Adrenal cortex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
