    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a patient with oral and maxillofacial trauma, there is a risk of cervical spine injury. Therefore, the preferred method of intubation should minimize movement of the cervical spine. Let's evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. LMA (Laryngeal Mask Airway): The LMA is a supraglottic airway device that does not require direct visualization of the vocal cords. However, it may still require some manipulation of the head and neck, which can potentially worsen cervical spine injury.\\n\\nB. Combitube: The Combitube is a dual-lumen airway device that can be blindly inserted into the trachea. Similar to the LMA, it may require manipulation of the head and neck, which can be detrimental in the presence of cervical spine injury.\\n\\nC. Normal laryngoscopy & endotracheal intubation: This involves direct visualization of the vocal cords using a laryngoscope and passing an endotracheal tube into the trachea. While this method provides the best control of the airway, it requires significant manipulation of the head and neck, which can potentially worsen cervical spine injury.\\n\\nD. Fiberoptic intubation: Fiberoptic intubation involves passing an endotracheal tube through the vocal cords using a flexible fiberoptic scope. This method allows for intubation without significant manipulation of the head and neck, making it the preferred choice in patients with suspected cervical spine injury.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the answer choice is D. Fiberoptic intubation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
