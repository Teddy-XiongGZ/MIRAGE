    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dimensional stability of elastomeric impression material refers to its ability to maintain its shape and size over time. To determine the descending order of dimensional stability, we need to consider the properties of each material. Polysulphide is known for its good dimensional stability, so it should be ranked higher in the order. Polyether is also known for its good dimensional stability, so it should be ranked higher as well. Condensation silicone has moderate dimensional stability compared to polysulphide and polyether. Addition silicone is known for its excellent dimensional stability, making it the most stable material. Based on this information, the correct descending order of dimensional stability for elastomeric impression material is: Addition silicone > Polyether > Polysulphide > Condensation silicone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Addition silicone > Polyether > Polysulphide > Condensation silicone\"}"
