    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anchoring fibres of lamina densa are part of the basement membrane, which is a specialized extracellular matrix. The main component of the basement membrane is collagen. Type 2 collagen is primarily found in cartilage, so it is unlikely to be present in the anchoring fibres of lamina densa. Type 6 collagen is involved in the formation of anchoring fibrils in the skin, but it is not a major component of the basement membrane. Type 7 collagen is primarily found in the anchoring fibrils of the basement membrane, but it is not a component of the anchoring fibres of lamina densa. Type 4 collagen is the major component of the anchoring fibres of lamina densa. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Type 4 collagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
