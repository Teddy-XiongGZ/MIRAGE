    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that is known to develop resistance to antibiotics. To determine the cause of resistance, we need to consider the options provided. \\n\\nA. Pleomorphism refers to the ability of a microorganism to change its shape or form, but it is not directly related to antibiotic resistance. \\n\\nB. Elaboration of an enzyme that destroys penicillin is a mechanism of resistance known as beta-lactamase production. This enzyme breaks down penicillin and renders it ineffective against the bacterium. \\n\\nC. Penicillin analogue production refers to the ability of the bacterium to produce chemicals that are similar to penicillin but do not have the same target or are not affected by the antibiotic. This is a mechanism of resistance. \\n\\nD. Lack of nucleic acid in the cell wall is not a known mechanism of resistance for Staphylococcus aureus. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is B. Elaboration of an enzyme that destroys penicillin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
