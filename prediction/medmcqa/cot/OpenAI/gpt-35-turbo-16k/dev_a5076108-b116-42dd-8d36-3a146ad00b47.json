    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a material turns to liquid on applying critical shear stress, it indicates that the material exhibits a non-Newtonian behavior. Non-Newtonian fluids do not follow Newton's law of viscosity, which states that the shear stress is directly proportional to the shear rate. Among the given options, the flow behavior described is characteristic of a Bingham body. A Bingham body is a type of non-Newtonian fluid that behaves as a solid until a certain critical shear stress is applied, at which point it starts to flow like a liquid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
