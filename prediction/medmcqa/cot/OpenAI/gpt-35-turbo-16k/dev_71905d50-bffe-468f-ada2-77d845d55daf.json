    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is used to diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It involves measuring blood glucose levels before and after consuming a glucose drink. The test is typically recommended for pregnant women who have certain risk factors for GDM. To determine which history is not an indication for performing the OGTT, we need to consider the risk factors associated with GDM. A. Previous Eclampsia is a risk factor for GDM, as women who have had eclampsia in a previous pregnancy are at an increased risk of developing GDM. B. Previous Congenital anomalies in the fetus is not a direct indication for performing the OGTT, as it is not a known risk factor for GDM. C. Previous Unexplained fetal loss is also not a direct indication for performing the OGTT, as it is not a known risk factor for GDM. D. Polyhydramnios is a risk factor for GDM, as it is associated with an increased risk of developing GDM. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Previous Congenital anomalies in the fetus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
