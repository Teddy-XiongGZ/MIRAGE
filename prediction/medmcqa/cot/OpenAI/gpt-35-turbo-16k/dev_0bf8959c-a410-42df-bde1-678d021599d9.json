    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mesiodistal dimension refers to the width of a tooth from the mesial (towards the midline) to the distal (away from the midline) aspect. The cervicoincisal dimension refers to the height of a tooth from the cervical (near the gumline) to the incisal (biting edge) aspect. To determine which anterior tooth has a mesiodistal size greater than the cervicoincisal dimension, we need to compare the width and height of each tooth. A. Deciduous lower central incisor: Deciduous teeth are baby teeth, and the lower central incisor is one of the front teeth in the lower jaw. In general, the mesiodistal dimension of deciduous teeth is smaller than the cervicoincisal dimension. B. Permanent lower central incisor: Permanent teeth are adult teeth, and the lower central incisor is one of the front teeth in the lower jaw. In general, the mesiodistal dimension of permanent teeth is larger than the cervicoincisal dimension. C. Deciduous upper lateral incisor: Deciduous teeth are baby teeth, and the upper lateral incisor is one of the front teeth in the upper jaw. In general, the mesiodistal dimension of deciduous teeth is smaller than the cervicoincisal dimension. D. Permanent upper lateral incisor: Permanent teeth are adult teeth, and the upper lateral incisor is one of the front teeth in the upper jaw. In general, the mesiodistal dimension of permanent teeth is larger than the cervicoincisal dimension. Based on this information, the only anterior tooth with a mesiodistal size greater than the cervicoincisal dimension is the Permanent lower central incisor (Choice B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
