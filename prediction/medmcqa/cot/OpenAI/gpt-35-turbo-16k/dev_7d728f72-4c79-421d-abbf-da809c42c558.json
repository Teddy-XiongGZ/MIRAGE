    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystocele, enterocele, and urethral descent are conditions that involve the descent or prolapse of pelvic organs. The muscles of the pelvic floor play a crucial role in supporting these organs. The pubococcygeus, ischiocavernosus, and bulbospongiosus muscles are all part of the pelvic floor. However, the sphincter of the urethra and anus is not directly involved in supporting the pelvic organs. Therefore, the injury to the muscle that causes cystocele, enterocele, and urethral descent is most likely the pubococcygeus muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
