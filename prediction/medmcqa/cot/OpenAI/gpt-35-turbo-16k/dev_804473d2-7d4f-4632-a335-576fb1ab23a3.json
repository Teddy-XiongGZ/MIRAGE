    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prostaglandins are a group of lipid compounds that have various physiological effects in the body. They are derived from arachidonic acid and play a role in inflammation, pain, and smooth muscle contraction. To determine the function of prostaglandins, we need to evaluate each option. \\n\\nA. Increase capillary permeability: Prostaglandins can indeed increase capillary permeability, leading to edema and inflammation. \\n\\nB. Uterine contraction: Prostaglandins are known to stimulate uterine contractions, which is important during labor and delivery. \\n\\nC. Lowers blood pressure: Prostaglandins have vasodilatory effects, which means they can lower blood pressure. \\n\\nD. Elevates blood pressure: This statement is incorrect. Prostaglandins do not elevate blood pressure; instead, they have the opposite effect by causing vasodilation. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Elevates blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
