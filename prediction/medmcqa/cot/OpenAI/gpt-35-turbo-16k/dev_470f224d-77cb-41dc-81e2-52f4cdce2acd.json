    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive release of thyroid hormones. It is typically triggered by a precipitating event in patients with underlying hyperthyroidism. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Ineffective pre-operative hormonal control: While inadequate control of thyroid hormones can contribute to the development of thyroid storm, it is not a direct cause.\\n\\nB. Manhandling of the thyroid gland during surgery: Manipulation of the thyroid gland during surgery can potentially lead to the release of excess thyroid hormones, but it is not a common cause of thyroid storm.\\n\\nC. Parathyroid tail left after surgery: The parathyroid glands are separate from the thyroid gland and are responsible for regulating calcium levels. Leaving a parathyroid tail after surgery would not directly cause thyroid storm.\\n\\nD. Poor preoperative preparation of the patient: This is the most likely cause of thyroid storm. Inadequate preoperative preparation, such as failure to control thyroid hormone levels or discontinuation of antithyroid medications, can trigger thyroid storm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
