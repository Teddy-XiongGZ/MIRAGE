    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ligand for receptors present in the liver for uptake of LDL is Apo B-100. LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is a lipoprotein particle that carries cholesterol and triglycerides in the bloodstream. Apo B-100 is the primary protein component of LDL and is recognized by the LDL receptors in the liver. Apo B-48 is found in chylomicrons, not LDL. Apo E is involved in the clearance of remnants of chylomicrons and VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein), but not specifically for LDL. Apo A-I is the main protein component of HDL (high-density lipoprotein), not LDL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
