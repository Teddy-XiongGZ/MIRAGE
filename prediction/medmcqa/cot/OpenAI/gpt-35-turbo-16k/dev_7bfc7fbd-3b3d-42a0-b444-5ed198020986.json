    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cross section of the root most prone to vertical root fracture can be determined by considering the shape of the root. Vertical root fractures occur when there is a crack that extends vertically through the root. The shape of the root can influence the likelihood of such fractures. A. Round: A round cross section would have equal dimensions in all directions, making it less prone to vertical root fractures as there are no weak points along the root. B. Oval: An oval cross section would have unequal dimensions in two directions, potentially creating weak points along the longer axis. This could increase the likelihood of vertical root fractures compared to a round cross section. C. Kidney shape: A kidney-shaped cross section would have a curved shape with a concave side. This shape may distribute forces more evenly along the root, reducing the likelihood of vertical root fractures. D. Elliptical: An elliptical cross section would have unequal dimensions in two directions, similar to an oval shape. This could create weak points along the longer axis, increasing the likelihood of vertical root fractures compared to a round cross section. Based on this analysis, the cross section of the root most prone to vertical root fracture would be B. Oval.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
