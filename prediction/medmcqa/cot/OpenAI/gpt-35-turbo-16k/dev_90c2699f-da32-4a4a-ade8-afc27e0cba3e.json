    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys. Let's go through each option to determine which one is not true. \\n\\nA. Autosomal dominant inheritance: This is true. APKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the condition on to each of their children.\\n\\nB. Hypertension is rare: This is not true. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a common feature of APKD. The cysts in the kidneys can disrupt normal kidney function, leading to increased blood pressure.\\n\\nC. Can be associated with cysts in liver, lungs, and pancreas: This is true. APKD can affect other organs besides the kidneys, and cysts can develop in the liver, lungs, and pancreas.\\n\\nD. Pyelonephritis is common: This is not true. Pyelonephritis, which is a bacterial infection of the kidneys, is not a common feature of APKD. However, individuals with APKD may be at a slightly increased risk of developing urinary tract infections, which can lead to pyelonephritis if left untreated. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the answer is B. Hypertension is rare.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
