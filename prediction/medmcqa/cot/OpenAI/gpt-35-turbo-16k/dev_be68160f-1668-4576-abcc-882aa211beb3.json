    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bilateral conductive deafness suggests a problem with the conduction of sound waves to the inner ear. Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus. Positive family history indicates a possible genetic component. Otospongiosis is a condition where abnormal bone growth affects the middle ear, leading to conductive hearing loss. Tympanosclerosis is the formation of scar tissue on the eardrum or middle ear structures, which can also cause conductive hearing loss. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear characterized by episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. B/L otitis media refers to bilateral inflammation of the middle ear, which can cause conductive hearing loss. Considering the symptoms of bilateral conductive deafness and tinnitus with a positive family history, the most likely diagnosis is Otospongiosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
