    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If the father is a balanced translocation carrier, it means that he has a rearrangement of genetic material where no genetic material is gained or lost. In this case, the father has a 21/21 translocation, which means that a piece of chromosome 21 has broken off and attached to another chromosome 21. When the father's sperm is formed, there is a 50% chance that it will carry the balanced translocation. If the father's sperm carrying the balanced translocation fertilizes the mother's egg, there is a 100% chance that the resulting child will have Down's syndrome. Therefore, the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies if the father is a balanced translocation carrier is 100%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
