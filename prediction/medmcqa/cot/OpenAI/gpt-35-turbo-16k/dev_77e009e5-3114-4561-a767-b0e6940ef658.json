    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Palatoglossus is a muscle that is involved in swallowing and speech. To determine its developmental origin, we need to consider the embryonic structures involved in its formation. The palatoglossus muscle is part of the soft palate, which is derived from the pharyngeal arches during embryonic development. The pharyngeal arches are a series of structures that form in the early stages of development and give rise to various structures in the head and neck region. The palatoglossus muscle specifically develops from the third pharyngeal arch. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Third arch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
