    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antiserum A and antiserum B are used to test for the presence of ABO blood group antigens. If no agglutination is seen, it means that neither antiserum A nor antiserum B reacted with the blood sample. This indicates that the blood sample does not have A or B antigens on the red blood cells. Therefore, the blood group is O. The Rh factor is tested separately using antiserum for Rh factor. If no agglutination is seen when Rh+ve antiserum is added, it means that the blood sample does not have the Rh antigen on the red blood cells. Therefore, the blood group is Rh-ve. Putting it all together, if no agglutination is seen with both antiserum A, antiserum B, and Rh+ve factor, the blood group is O group and Rh-ve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. O group and Rh-ve\"}"
