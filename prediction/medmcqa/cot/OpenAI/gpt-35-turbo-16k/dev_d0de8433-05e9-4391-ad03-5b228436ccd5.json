    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucogenic compounds are those that can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate is a key intermediate in gluconeogenesis and can be converted into glucose. Oxaloacetate is also a key intermediate in gluconeogenesis and can be converted into glucose. Acetyl-CoA, on the other hand, cannot be converted into glucose and is therefore not glucogenic. Lactate can also be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. Therefore, the answer is C. Acetyl-CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
