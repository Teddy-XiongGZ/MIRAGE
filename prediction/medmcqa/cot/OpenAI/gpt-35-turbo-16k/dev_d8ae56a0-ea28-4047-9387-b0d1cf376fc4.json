    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, usually involving the heart valves. It is most commonly caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and attaching to damaged heart valves or other areas of the heart. The risk of developing infective endocarditis is highest in individuals with certain underlying heart conditions, such as congenital heart defects or valve abnormalities. Mitral stenosis is a condition where the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium and left ventricle, becomes narrowed. This narrowing can increase the risk of blood clots forming on the valve, which can then lead to infective endocarditis. Therefore, mitral stenosis is not the least common cause of infective endocarditis. Aortic stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve, which separates the left ventricle and the aorta, becomes narrowed. Similar to mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis can increase the risk of blood clots forming on the valve and subsequently lead to infective endocarditis. Therefore, aortic stenosis is not the least common cause of infective endocarditis. VSD stands for ventricular septal defect, which is a congenital heart defect where there is a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). While VSD itself does not directly increase the risk of infective endocarditis, individuals with VSD may have other associated heart abnormalities or undergo surgical repair, which can increase the risk. Therefore, VSD is not the least common cause of infective endocarditis. ASD stands for atrial septal defect, which is a congenital heart defect where there is a hole in the wall separating the two upper chambers of the heart (atria). Similar to VSD, ASD itself does not directly increase the risk of infective endocarditis. However, individuals with ASD may have other associated heart abnormalities or undergo surgical repair, which can increase the risk. Therefore, ASD is not the least common cause of infective endocarditis. Based on the above information, the least common cause of infective endocarditis among the given choices is Mitral stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
