    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The contractile element in a skeletal muscle refers to the part of the muscle responsible for generating force and causing muscle contraction. The sarcolemma is the cell membrane of a muscle fiber and is not directly involved in muscle contraction. The sarcoplasm is the cytoplasm of a muscle fiber and contains various organelles, but it is not the contractile element. The endomysium is the connective tissue that surrounds individual muscle fibers, but it is not the contractile element either. The myofibril, on the other hand, is the contractile element of a skeletal muscle. It is composed of repeating units called sarcomeres, which contain the proteins actin and myosin that interact to generate muscle contraction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Myofibril\"}"
