    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The purpose of plane of orientation can be determined by analyzing the given options. Option A states that the purpose is to serve as a guide in establishing occlusal plane. This means that the plane of orientation helps in determining the position of the occlusal plane, which is the biting surface of the teeth. Option B suggests that the purpose is to aid in measuring the height and length of posterior teeth. This means that the plane of orientation helps in determining the dimensions of the back teeth. Option C states that the purpose is to serve as an arbitrary plane when established on the articulator. This means that the plane of orientation is used as a reference point on an articulator, which is a device used to simulate jaw movements. Option D suggests that the purpose is to divide the distance between upper and lower cast equally. This means that the plane of orientation helps in dividing the distance between the upper and lower dental casts equally. Based on these options, the most appropriate answer is C. To serve as an arbitrary plane when established on the articulator.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
