    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: N. gonorrhoea is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the genital tract, causing urethritis in males and cervicitis in females. It is a sexually transmitted infection.\\nStep 2: Option A states that N. gonorrhoea is the most common cause of urethritis in males. This is true, as N. gonorrhoea is one of the main pathogens responsible for urethritis in males.\\nStep 3: Option B states that all stains of N. gonorrhoea are highly susceptible to penicillin. This is not true, as there has been an increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoea, including strains that are resistant to penicillin.\\nStep 4: Option C states that wide spread axoregnic stains cause disseminated gonococcal infection. This is true, as disseminated gonococcal infection can occur when the infection spreads beyond the genital tract to other parts of the body.\\nStep 5: Option D states that N. gonorrhoea is found exclusively in human beings. This is true, as N. gonorrhoea is a human-specific pathogen and does not infect other animals.\\nStep 6: Based on the above analysis, the answer is B. All stains are highly susceptible to penicillin, as this statement is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
