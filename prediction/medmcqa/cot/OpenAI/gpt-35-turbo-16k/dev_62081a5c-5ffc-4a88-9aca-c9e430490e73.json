    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in managing a patient with severe bleeding is to ensure airway maintenance. This is because maintaining a patent airway is crucial for the patient's survival. Once the airway is secured, further management can be initiated. Internal iliac artery ligation may be considered in cases of severe bleeding that cannot be controlled by other means, but it is not the first line of management.
