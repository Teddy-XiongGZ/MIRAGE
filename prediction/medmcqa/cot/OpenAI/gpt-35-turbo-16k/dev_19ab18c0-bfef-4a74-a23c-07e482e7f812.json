    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most effective, scientifically proven and cost efficient caries prevention program in children, we need to consider the evidence and cost-effectiveness of each option. Let's evaluate each choice:\\n\\nA. Enameloplasty: Enameloplasty involves reshaping the tooth enamel to remove rough surfaces and prevent plaque accumulation. While it can be effective in certain cases, it is not a comprehensive caries prevention program.\\n\\nB. Oral health education: Providing children with oral health education can be effective in promoting good oral hygiene practices and preventing caries. However, it may not be the most cost efficient program.\\n\\nC. Pit and fissure sealants: Pit and fissure sealants are a proven and cost-effective method for preventing caries in children. They involve applying a protective coating to the chewing surfaces of the teeth, sealing off the deep grooves where bacteria can accumulate.\\n\\nD. ART (Atraumatic Restorative Treatment): ART is a minimally invasive approach to treating dental caries in children. While it is effective in treating existing caries, it may not be the most cost efficient program for prevention.\\n\\nConsidering the evidence and cost-effectiveness, the most effective, scientifically proven and cost efficient caries prevention program in children is pit and fissure sealants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
