    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pancreatic secretion is regulated by various hormones and factors. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Cck (cholecystokinin) is a hormone released by the small intestine in response to the presence of fats and proteins. It stimulates the release of pancreatic enzymes and promotes the contraction of the gallbladder to release bile. Therefore, Cck does have an effect on pancreatic secretion.\\n\\nB. Gastrin is a hormone released by the stomach in response to the presence of food. It stimulates the release of gastric acid and also has a minor effect on pancreatic secretion. Therefore, Gastrin does have an effect on pancreatic secretion.\\n\\nC. Secretin is a hormone released by the small intestine in response to the presence of acidic chyme. It stimulates the release of bicarbonate from the pancreas to neutralize the acidity in the duodenum. Therefore, Secretin does have an effect on pancreatic secretion.\\n\\nD. Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is a hormone released by the small intestine in response to the presence of food, particularly glucose and fat. It inhibits gastric acid secretion and also stimulates insulin release from the pancreas. However, GIP does not have a direct effect on pancreatic enzyme secretion. Therefore, Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is the correct answer as it doesn't have any effect on pancreatic secretion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
