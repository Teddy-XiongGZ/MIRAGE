    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In dislocation of the jaw, the displacement of the articular disc beyond the articular tubercle of the temporomandibular joint is usually caused by excessive contraction or spasm of a muscle. The muscle responsible for this displacement is the lateral pterygoid muscle. This muscle is located in the region of the temporomandibular joint and plays a key role in jaw movement and opening. When it contracts excessively or goes into spasm, it can cause the jaw to dislocate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lateral pterygoid\"}"
