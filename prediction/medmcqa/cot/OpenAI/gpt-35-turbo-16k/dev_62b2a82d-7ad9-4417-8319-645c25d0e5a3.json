    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polymerization shrinkage refers to the contraction that occurs when a composite resin material hardens. Let's evaluate each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. The more surface area of bonded structure causes LESS shrinkage compare to surface area of unbounded structure restoration. This statement is incorrect. The more surface area of bonded structure actually causes MORE shrinkage compared to the surface area of an unbounded structure restoration.\\n\\nB. Class-V composite restoration causes contraction more than gold restoration. This statement is true. Class-V composite restorations, which involve the restoration of cavities on the root surface, tend to have more polymerization shrinkage compared to gold restorations.\\n\\nC. Etching and priming reduces shrinkages. This statement is true. Etching and priming of the tooth surface before placing the composite resin restoration can help reduce polymerization shrinkage.\\n\\nD. One third (1/3rd) of the enamel involves causes more shrinkage. This statement is incorrect. The extent of enamel involvement does not directly correlate with the amount of polymerization shrinkage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
