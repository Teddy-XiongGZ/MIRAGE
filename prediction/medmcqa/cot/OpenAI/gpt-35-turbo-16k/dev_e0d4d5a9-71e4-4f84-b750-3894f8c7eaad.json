    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Grids are used in radiography to reduce scatter radiation and improve image quality. However, they also have some disadvantages. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Skin exposure of patient: Grids can increase the amount of radiation that reaches the patient's skin, but this is not a disadvantage of grids themselves. It is a consequence of using grids.\\n\\nB. Increase exposure time: Grids can absorb some of the radiation, which may require longer exposure times to compensate. This is a disadvantage of using grids.\\n\\nC. Doesn't improve image: This is not a disadvantage of grids. Grids are specifically designed to improve image quality by reducing scatter radiation.\\n\\nD. Overall density of radiograph is increased: Grids can increase the overall density of the radiograph, as they absorb some of the radiation. This is a disadvantage of using grids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
