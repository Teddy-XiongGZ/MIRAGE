    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dystrophic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium salts in injured or necrotic tissues. To determine which oral tissue is most commonly affected by dystrophic calcification, we need to consider the characteristics of each option. Enamel is the hard outer layer of the tooth and is not typically affected by calcification. Pulp is the soft tissue inside the tooth and can undergo calcification in certain conditions, but it is not the most common site. Dentin is the hard tissue beneath the enamel and can also undergo calcification, but it is not the most common site either. The periodontal ligament is the connective tissue that surrounds and supports the tooth in the socket, and it is the most likely site for dystrophic calcification due to its proximity to injured or necrotic tissues. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Periodontal ligament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
