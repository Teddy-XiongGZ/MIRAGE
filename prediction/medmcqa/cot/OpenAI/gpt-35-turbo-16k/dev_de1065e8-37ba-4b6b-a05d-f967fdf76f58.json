    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"MHC Class II proteins are involved in presenting antigens to helper T-cells. They are primarily expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as B-cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Platelets do not express MHC Class II proteins, and T-cells are primarily involved in MHC Class I antigen presentation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. B-cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
