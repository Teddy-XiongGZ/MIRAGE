    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"TNM staging is a system used to describe the extent of cancer in a patient's body. It stands for Tumor, Node, and Metastasis. The T category describes the size and extent of the primary tumor, the N category describes the involvement of nearby lymph nodes, and the M category describes the presence of distant metastasis. Each category is assigned a numerical value or code based on the extent of the cancer. Since the categories have a specific order and represent different levels of severity, TNM staging is considered an ordinal scale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
