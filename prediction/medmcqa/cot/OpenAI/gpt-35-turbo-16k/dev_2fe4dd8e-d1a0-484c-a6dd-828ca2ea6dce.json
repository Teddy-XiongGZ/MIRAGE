    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is innervated by several nerves. To determine the sensory nerve supply of the capsule of TMJ, we need to consider the anatomy of the region. The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3) and provides sensory innervation to the temporomandibular joint capsule, as well as the skin of the temple and external ear. The facial nerve (VII) primarily innervates the muscles of facial expression and does not supply sensory innervation to the TMJ capsule. The masseteric nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3) and provides motor innervation to the masseter muscle, but not sensory innervation to the TMJ capsule. The auricular nerve primarily innervates the external ear and does not supply sensory innervation to the TMJ capsule. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Auriculotemporal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
