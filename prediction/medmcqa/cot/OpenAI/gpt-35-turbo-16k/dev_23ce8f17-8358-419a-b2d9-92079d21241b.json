    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maternal mortality refers to the death of a pregnant woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days after delivery. To determine which heart disease has the highest maternal mortality, we need to consider the impact of each heart disease on pregnancy and childbirth. A. Eisenmenger's complex is a condition where a congenital heart defect causes a reversal of blood flow within the heart. This condition can lead to severe complications during pregnancy, including heart failure and increased risk of maternal mortality. B. Coarctation of aorta is a narrowing of the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. While this condition can cause complications during pregnancy, it is not typically associated with high maternal mortality rates. C. Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the mitral valve, which controls blood flow between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart. This condition can lead to increased pressure in the left atrium and lungs, causing complications during pregnancy. However, it is not typically associated with high maternal mortality rates. D. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the rest of the body. This condition can cause complications during pregnancy, but it is not typically associated with high maternal mortality rates. Based on this information, the heart disease with the highest maternal mortality is likely A. Eisenmenger's complex, as it can lead to severe complications during pregnancy and childbirth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
