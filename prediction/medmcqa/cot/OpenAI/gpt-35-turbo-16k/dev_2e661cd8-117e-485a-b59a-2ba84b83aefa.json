    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a tooth loses its antagonist, there is no longer any force being applied to the tooth. This lack of force can lead to changes in the periodontal ligament (PDL) space. Normally, the PDL space appears as a thin radiolucent line around the root of the tooth on a radiograph.
