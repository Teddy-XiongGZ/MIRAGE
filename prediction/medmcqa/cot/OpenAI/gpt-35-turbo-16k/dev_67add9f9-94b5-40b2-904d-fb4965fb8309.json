    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Erythroblastosis fetalis is a condition where there is an incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and the fetus. It occurs when the mother has antibodies against the fetal red blood cells. These antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the fetal red blood cells, leading to hemolysis. The most common cause of erythroblastosis fetalis is Rh incompatibility, where the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive.
