    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The porosity formed due to simultaneous nucleation of solid grains and gas bubbles at the first moment that metal freezes at the mold walls is called micro porosity. This type of porosity occurs due to the entrapment of gas during solidification. Pinhole porosity refers to small, isolated holes or voids in the metal. Gas inclusion porosity refers to the presence of gas bubbles within the metal. Subsurface porosity refers to porosity that is located beneath the surface of the metal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Micro porosity\"}"
