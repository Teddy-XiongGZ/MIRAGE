    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High copper dental amalgams are considered superior to other amalgams for several reasons. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is the most accurate. \\n\\nA. Have less marginal breakdown: Marginal breakdown refers to the deterioration of the amalgam at the edges or margins. High copper dental amalgams have been shown to have better marginal integrity and less marginal breakdown compared to other amalgams. \\n\\nB. Are workable at lower Hg-alloy ratio: Workability refers to the ease with which the amalgam can be manipulated and shaped. While high copper dental amalgams do offer good workability, this is not a specific advantage over other amalgams. \\n\\nC. Have a higher ratio of tensile to compressive strength: Tensile strength refers to the ability of a material to resist being pulled apart, while compressive strength refers to its ability to withstand compression or being squashed. High copper dental amalgams do not necessarily have a higher ratio of tensile to compressive strength compared to other amalgams. \\n\\nD. Have less resistance to tarnish and corrosion: High copper dental amalgams actually have better resistance to tarnish and corrosion compared to other amalgams. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate statement is that high copper dental amalgams have less marginal breakdown.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
