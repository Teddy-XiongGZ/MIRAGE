    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lefort 1 osteotomy is a surgical procedure used to reposition the maxilla (upper jaw) in relation to the rest of the facial skeleton. It involves making a horizontal osteotomy (bone cut) above the level of the teeth and separating the maxilla from the rest of the skull. The maxilla is then repositioned and fixed in its new position. Based on this information, Lefort 1 osteotomy essentially involves osteotomy of 2 bones: the maxilla and the pterygoid plates. The maxilla is the main bone being cut and repositioned, while the pterygoid plates, which are part of the sphenoid bone, are also separated from the rest of the skull during the procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
