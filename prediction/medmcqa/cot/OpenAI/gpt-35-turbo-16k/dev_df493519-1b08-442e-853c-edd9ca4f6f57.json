    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Leishmann's stain is commonly used in the field of hematology to stain blood smears for microscopic examination. Acetone free methyl alcohol is present in Leishmann's stain for a specific purpose. To determine the purpose, let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. It fixes cells to the slide: Acetone free methyl alcohol is not typically used as a fixative in Leishmann's stain. \\n\\nB. It colors the red cells: Leishmann's stain primarily stains the nuclei of cells, not the red blood cells themselves. \\n\\nC. It prevents the cells from sticking to the slide surface: This is a possible purpose of acetone free methyl alcohol in Leishmann's stain. It helps to prevent the cells from sticking to the slide surface during the staining process. \\n\\nD. It stops metabolic and enzymatic activity of the cell: Acetone free methyl alcohol does not have a significant effect on the metabolic and enzymatic activity of cells. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most likely purpose of acetone free methyl alcohol in Leishmann's stain is to prevent the cells from sticking to the slide surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
