    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post transcriptional modifications of RNA occur after transcription and before translation. Splicing is the process of removing introns and joining exons together to form mature mRNA. 5' capping is the addition of a modified guanine nucleotide to the 5' end of mRNA. 3' polyadenylation is the addition of a poly-A tail to the 3' end of mRNA. Glycosylation, on the other hand, is a post translational modification that occurs after translation, where sugar molecules are added to proteins. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Glycosylation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
