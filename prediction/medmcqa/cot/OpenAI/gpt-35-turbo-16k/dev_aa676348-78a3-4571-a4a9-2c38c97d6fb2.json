    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the rate of loading is decreased, it means that the material is being subjected to a slower application of force or stress. This slower loading rate allows the material more time to adjust and redistribute the applied stress, resulting in a more uniform distribution of stress within the material. As a result, the material is able to deform and accommodate the applied stress more easily, leading to an increase in its mechanical properties. Therefore, the answer is B. Increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
