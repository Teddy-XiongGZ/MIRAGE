    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. It is caused by a deficiency or absence of certain clotting factors. Since hemophilia impairs the clotting process, it is expected that hemophilics will have increased bleeding time. This means that it takes longer for bleeding to stop. However, hemophilia does not affect the clotting time, which refers to the time it takes for blood to form a clot. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Increased bleeding time and clotting time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
