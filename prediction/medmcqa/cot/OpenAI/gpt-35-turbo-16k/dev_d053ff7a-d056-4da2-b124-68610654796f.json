    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Depression of the mandible refers to the downward movement of the lower jaw. To achieve this movement, several muscles work together. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Digastric: The digastric muscle is responsible for opening the mouth by depressing the mandible.\\n\\nB. Lateral pterygoid: The lateral pterygoid muscle is involved in the protrusion and lateral movement of the mandible, but it does not directly contribute to the depression of the mandible.\\n\\nC. Geniohyoid: The geniohyoid muscle is responsible for the elevation of the hyoid bone, but it does not directly contribute to the depression of the mandible.\\n\\nD. All of the above: Since the digastric muscle is involved in the depression of the mandible, option D is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Digastric.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
