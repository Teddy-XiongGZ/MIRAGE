    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi tendon organ is a sensory receptor located at the junction between a muscle and its tendon. It is responsible for monitoring tension or force within the muscle. The average number of muscle fibers attached to one Golgi tendon organ can vary depending on the muscle and the individual. However, typically, there are multiple muscle fibers attached to one Golgi tendon organ to provide accurate feedback on muscle tension. Based on this information, the most reasonable answer would be A. 3-Jan, as it represents a small number of muscle fibers attached to one Golgi tendon organ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
