When a person is in the recumbent position, the posterior segment of the right upper lobe is more likely to be affected due to the anatomical position and the effect of gravity.\\n\\nD. Aspiration responsible for 5-15% of community acquired pneumonia: This statement is true. Aspiration is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, accounting for 5-15% of cases. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, option B is the answer choice as it is not true that fungal infection is the common cause of pneumonia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
