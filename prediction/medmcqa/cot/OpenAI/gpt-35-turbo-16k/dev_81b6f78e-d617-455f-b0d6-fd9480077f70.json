    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's evaluate option A. Cow's milk contains both whey protein and casein, but the ratio is approximately 20% whey protein and 80% casein. So, option A is incorrect. Next, let's consider option B. Cow's milk does have less carbohydrate than mother's milk. This is because cow's milk is designed for the nutritional needs of calves, while mother's milk is tailored for the needs of human infants. So, option B is correct. Finally, let's analyze option C. Cow's milk does have higher levels of potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) compared to infant formula feeds. So, option C is correct. Since options A, B, and C are all correct, the answer is D. Therefore, the correct answer is D. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
