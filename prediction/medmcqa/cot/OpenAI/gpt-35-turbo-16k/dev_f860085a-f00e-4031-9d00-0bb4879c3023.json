    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nasal fractures are common injuries that can occur due to trauma to the nose. Let's evaluate each statement to determine which one is not true. \\n\\nA. Even if minor, they may be followed by bilateral ecchymosis and facial oedema: This statement is true. Nasal fractures, even if minor, can cause bruising and swelling on both sides of the nose and face.\\n\\nB. They may need to be reduced for a few weeks: This statement is not true. Nasal fractures typically require reduction, which is the realignment of the broken bones, within the first few days after the injury. The duration of reduction is usually not a few weeks.\\n\\nC. They need not be complicated by traumatic telecanthus: This statement is true. Traumatic telecanthus refers to the widening of the distance between the inner corners of the eyes due to a nasal fracture. Not all nasal fractures result in telecanthus.\\n\\nD. They may lead to the telescoping of the nasal complex into the frontal sinus: This statement is true. In some cases, nasal fractures can cause the nasal complex to collapse and push into the frontal sinus.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, statement B is not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
