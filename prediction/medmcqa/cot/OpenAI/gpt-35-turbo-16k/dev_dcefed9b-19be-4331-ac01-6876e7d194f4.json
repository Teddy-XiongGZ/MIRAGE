    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is primarily caused by acid-producing bacteria. These bacteria ferment carbohydrates from the diet and produce acids that demineralize the tooth enamel, leading to the formation of cavities. Actinomyces spp. are gram-positive bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity, but they are not directly responsible for the progression of dental caries. Proteolytic bacteria are bacteria that break down proteins, but they are not the primary cause of dental caries. Gram-positive bacteria are a broad category that includes Actinomyces spp., but not all gram-positive bacteria are responsible for dental caries. Acidogenic bacteria, on the other hand, are bacteria that produce acid as a byproduct of carbohydrate fermentation, and they are directly responsible for the progression of dental caries. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Acidogenic bacteria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
