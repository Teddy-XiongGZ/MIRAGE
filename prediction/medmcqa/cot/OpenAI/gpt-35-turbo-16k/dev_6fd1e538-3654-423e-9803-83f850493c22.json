    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At resting membrane potential, the equilibrium potentials of X and Y are -30mV and -40mV respectively. This means that the membrane potential is more negative than the equilibrium potentials of both X and Y. If a drug is infused that blocks the permeability of Z, it means that the membrane will no longer be freely permeable to Z. Since the equilibrium potential of Z is not provided, we cannot determine whether it is more positive or more negative than the resting membrane potential. However, since the membrane potential is more negative than the equilibrium potentials of X and Y, blocking the permeability of Z is likely to have little to no effect on the membrane potential. Therefore, the answer is C. No change.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
