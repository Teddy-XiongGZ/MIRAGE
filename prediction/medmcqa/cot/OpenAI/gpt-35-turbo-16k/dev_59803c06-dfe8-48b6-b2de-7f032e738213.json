    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Muscle spindles are sensory receptors located within skeletal muscles that detect changes in muscle length and tension. They consist of specialized muscle fibers called intrafusal fibers, which are surrounded by a connective tissue capsule. The intrafusal fibers can be classified into three types: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers, which are found in the central zone, and the static nuclear bag fibers, which are found in the peripheral zone. A. The central zone of the muscle spindle contains both actin and myosin filaments. This is necessary for the contraction and relaxation of the intrafusal fibers in response to changes in muscle length and tension. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. B. Type 1 nuclear bag fibers have a low myosin ATPase activity. Myosin ATPase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP to provide energy for muscle contraction. Type 1 nuclear bag fibers are involved in detecting the rate of change in muscle length. Their low myosin ATPase activity allows them to respond to slow changes in muscle length. Therefore, statement B is correct. C. The peripheral zone of the muscle spindle contains actin and myosin filaments. These filaments are responsible for the contraction and relaxation of the static nuclear bag fibers in response to changes in muscle length and tension. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. D. Type 2 nuclear bag fibers have a high level of myosin ATPase activity. This allows them to respond to rapid changes in muscle length. Therefore, statement D is correct. Based on the above explanations, the faulty statement regarding muscle spindle is statement A, which states that the central zone has no actin and myosin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
