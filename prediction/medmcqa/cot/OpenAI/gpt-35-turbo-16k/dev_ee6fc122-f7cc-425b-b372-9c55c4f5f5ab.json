    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The modified Bishop score is used to assess the readiness of the cervix for induction of labor. It takes into account five parameters: cervical dilation, cervical effacement, cervical consistency, cervical position, and fetal station. In this case, the cervix is 1 cm dilated, 30% effaced, soft, and posterior. The fetal station is at -1. According to the modified Bishop score, the points assigned for each parameter are as follows: 0 points for 0 cm dilation, 0 points for 0-30% effacement, 1 point for soft cervix, 0 points for posterior cervix, and 1 point for -1 station. Adding up these points, the modified Bishop score for this lady would be 2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
