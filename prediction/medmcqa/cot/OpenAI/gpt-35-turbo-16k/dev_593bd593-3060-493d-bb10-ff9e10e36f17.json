    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Rh isoimmunization, exchange transfusion is indicated if there is a risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia and its associated complications. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Cord blood hemoglobin is less than 10 g %: Low cord blood hemoglobin levels may indicate anemia, but it is not a direct indication for exchange transfusion in Rh isoimmunization.\\n\\nB. Cord bilirubin is more than 5 mg: Elevated cord bilirubin levels can indicate the presence of significant hemolysis, which is a concern in Rh isoimmunization. However, it alone is not a definitive indication for exchange transfusion.\\n\\nC. History of previous sibling affected: This is a significant risk factor for severe Rh isoimmunization. Previous affected siblings indicate a higher likelihood of severe hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia. Exchange transfusion may be considered in such cases.\\n\\nD. All of these: This option includes all the mentioned factors, and indeed, all of them are considered when deciding to perform an exchange transfusion in Rh isoimmunization. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of these.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
