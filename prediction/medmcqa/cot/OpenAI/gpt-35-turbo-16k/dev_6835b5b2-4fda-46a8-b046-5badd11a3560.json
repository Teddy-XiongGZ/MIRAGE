    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tramadol is known to act as an analgesic drug by stimulating mu opioid receptors. However, it also has an additional mechanism of action. To determine this, we can evaluate the potential choices. Option A, serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition, is a known mechanism of action for some antidepressant medications, but it is not the additional mechanism of action of tramadol. Option B, anticholinergic, refers to drugs that block the action of acetylcholine and is not relevant to tramadol. Option C, antihistaminic, refers to drugs that block the action of histamine and is also not relevant to tramadol. Option D, serotonin and dopamine reuptake inhibition, is the correct answer. Tramadol is known to inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and dopamine, in addition to its mu opioid receptor stimulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
