    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves. It is most commonly caused by bacteria. To determine the organism that causes bacterial endocarditis, we need to consider the bacteria that are commonly associated with this condition. Lactobacillus is a type of bacteria that is not commonly associated with causing endocarditis. Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus viridans are both types of bacteria that are known to cause endocarditis. Streptococcus pyogenes, on the other hand, is not commonly associated with causing endocarditis. Therefore, the most likely organism that causes bacterial endocarditis among the given choices is either Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus viridans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Streptococcus viridans\"}"
