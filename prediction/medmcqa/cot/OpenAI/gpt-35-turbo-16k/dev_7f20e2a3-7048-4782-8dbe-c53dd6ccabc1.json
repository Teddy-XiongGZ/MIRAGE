    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most effective method of reducing patient somatic exposure when taking a radiograph. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. A lead apron: A lead apron is used to protect the patient's body from scattered radiation, but it does not reduce somatic exposure directly.\\n\\nB. Speed E film: Speed E film refers to a type of film that requires less radiation exposure to produce an image. While it can reduce the amount of radiation needed, it does not directly reduce somatic exposure.\\n\\nC. Added filtration: Added filtration refers to the use of additional filters in the X-ray machine to remove low-energy X-rays. This can help reduce patient somatic exposure by filtering out unnecessary radiation.\\n\\nD. An open ended, shielded cone: An open ended, shielded cone is a device used to limit the X-ray beam to the area of interest and reduce scatter radiation. It can help reduce somatic exposure by focusing the radiation only on the necessary area.\\n\\nBased on the options provided, the most effective method of reducing patient somatic exposure when taking a radiograph is C. Added filtration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
