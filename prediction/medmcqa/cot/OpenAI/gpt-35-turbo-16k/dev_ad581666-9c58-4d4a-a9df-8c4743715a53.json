    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a molecule group from one molecule to another. To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the function of each enzyme listed. \\n\\nA. Oxidases: Oxidases are enzymes that catalyze oxidation reactions, not the transfer of molecule groups. \\n\\nB. Oxidases: This is a duplicate of option A. \\n\\nC. Transferases: Transferases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a molecule group from one molecule to another. This matches the description given in the question. \\n\\nD. Lipases: Lipases are enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of lipids, not the transfer of molecule groups. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Transferases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
