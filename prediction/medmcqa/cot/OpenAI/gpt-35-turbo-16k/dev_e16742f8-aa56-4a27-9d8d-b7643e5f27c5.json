    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hypoxic Ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a condition that occurs when there is a lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain, leading to brain injury. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is true for HIE. A. Lower limbs affected more than upper limbs: This is not true for HIE. HIE typically affects the brain and can result in global motor deficits, affecting both upper and lower limbs. B. Prox. Muscles > distal muscles: This is not true for HIE. HIE can result in a variety of motor deficits, but it does not specifically affect proximal muscles more than distal muscles. C. Seizure: This is true for HIE. HIE can cause seizures due to the brain injury. Seizures are a common manifestation of HIE. D. Trunk involved: This is true for HIE. HIE can affect the trunk, leading to motor deficits and impaired trunk control. Based on the evaluation, the true statement for HIE is that seizures occur and the trunk is involved.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
