    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"On a primary 2nd molar, caries occur most commonly on the occlusal pit and fissures. This is because the occlusal surface of the tooth has deep pits and fissures that can trap food particles and bacteria, making it more susceptible to decay. Proximal caries below the contact point is less common in primary molars because the contact point is usually tight, preventing food and bacteria from getting trapped in between the teeth. Buccal surface caries and proximal caries above the contact point are also less common compared to occlusal caries on primary 2nd molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
