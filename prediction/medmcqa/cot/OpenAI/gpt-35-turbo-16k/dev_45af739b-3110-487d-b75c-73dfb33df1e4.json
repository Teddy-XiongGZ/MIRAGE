    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phage mediated change in C. diphtheria is a process where genetic material is transferred from one bacterium to another through the action of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). This process is known as transduction. Conjugation involves the transfer of genetic material through direct cell-to-cell contact, while transformation involves the uptake of free DNA from the environment. Since the question specifically mentions phage-mediated change, the correct answer is C. Transduction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
