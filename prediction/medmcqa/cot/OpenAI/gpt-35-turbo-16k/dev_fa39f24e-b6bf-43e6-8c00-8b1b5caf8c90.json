    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In dentistry, sedatives are used to help patients relax and reduce anxiety during dental procedures. The most commonly used sedatives in dentistry are benzodiazepines, which are a class of drugs that have sedative, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), and muscle relaxant properties. Benzodiazepines are known to induce a state of relaxation and calmness, making them ideal for dental procedures. Morphine is an opioid analgesic and is not typically used as a sedative in dentistry. NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are commonly used for pain relief and inflammation, but they do not have sedative properties.

Benzodiazepines.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
