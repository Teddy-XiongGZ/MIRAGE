    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CT scan is a commonly used imaging modality to detect nodal metastasis. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Spiculated node: A spiculated node refers to a node with irregular or jagged margins. This can be seen on CT scan as an abnormality in the shape of the node.\\n\\nB. Size more than 6 mm: Nodal metastasis is often associated with an increase in size of the affected lymph node. CT scan can detect enlarged lymph nodes, including those larger than 6 mm.\\n\\nC. Necrotic node: A necrotic node refers to a node that has undergone tissue death. On CT scan, necrotic nodes may appear as areas of low attenuation or central hypodensity.\\n\\nD. Rounded node: A rounded node is a general term that does not provide specific information about the appearance of the node on CT scan. It is possible for a rounded node to be seen on CT scan in cases of nodal metastasis.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the option that is not seen on CT scan in case of nodal metastasis is C. Necrotic node.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
