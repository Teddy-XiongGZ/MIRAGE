    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child developed hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly after being weaned from breast milk and given sugarcane juice. This suggests a metabolic disorder related to carbohydrate metabolism. The presence of hypophosphatemia and reducing substances in urine further narrows down the possibilities. Fructokinase deficiency (choice A) is unlikely because it would not cause hypoglycemia or hepatomegaly. Aldolase B deficiency (choice B) is associated with hereditary fructose intolerance, but it does not cause hypophosphatemia. Beta galactosidase deficiency (choice D) is associated with lactose intolerance, but it does not cause hypoglycemia or hepatomegaly. The most likely enzyme deficiency in this case is glucose 6 phosphatase (choice C), which is responsible for gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to glycogen storage disease type I (von Gierke disease), which presents with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and hypophosphatemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
