    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To work out the mean and standard deviation, we need to perform mathematical calculations on the data. The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of the data. It is calculated using the individual values and their deviation from the mean. In order to perform these calculations, we need to have numerical data that can be manipulated mathematically. Nominal and ordinal scales do not provide numerical values that can be used for calculations. Dichotomous scale only has two categories, which may not provide enough variability for meaningful calculations. Therefore, the data needs to be on an interval/ratio scale, where the values have a consistent numerical relationship and can be used for mathematical calculations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
