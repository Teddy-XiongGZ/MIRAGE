    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which drug must be sold only on production of a prescription by a registered medical practitioner, we need to understand the different schedules of drugs. In India, drugs are classified into different schedules based on their potential for abuse and the level of control required. Schedule H drugs can be sold only on production of a prescription by a registered medical practitioner. Schedule G drugs are not commonly used and do not require a prescription. Schedule X drugs are highly potent and have a high potential for abuse, so they also require a prescription.
