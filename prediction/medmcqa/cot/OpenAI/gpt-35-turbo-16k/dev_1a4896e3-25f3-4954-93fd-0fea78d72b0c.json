    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, we need to understand the inheritance pattern of each condition. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the condition on to each of their children. Lichen planus, bullous pemphigoid, and pemphigus vulgaris are all autoimmune skin conditions and are not typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
