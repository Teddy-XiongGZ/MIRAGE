    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Caesarean section is a surgical procedure in which a baby is delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen and uterus. It is typically performed when a vaginal delivery is not possible or safe for the mother or baby. In this question, we are asked to identify the indications for caesarean section in pregnancy that are NOT appropriate. Eisenmenger's syndrome is a condition characterized by a heart defect that causes blood to flow abnormally in the heart and lungs. This condition can lead to severe complications during pregnancy and delivery, making caesarean section a possible indication. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart, which can restrict blood flow. This condition can also pose risks during pregnancy and delivery, making caesarean section a possible indication. MR, or mitral regurgitation, is a condition in which the mitral valve in the heart does not close properly, causing blood to flow backward. While this condition can complicate pregnancy, it is not typically an indication for caesarean section. Aortic regurgitation is a condition in which the aortic valve does not close properly, causing blood to flow backward. Similar to MR, it can complicate pregnancy but is not typically an indication for caesarean section. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. MR, as it is not an indication for caesarean section in pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
