    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Before copal varnish is applied on an unbounded amalgam restoration, the smear layer should be modified. The smear layer is a layer of debris and organic material that forms on the surface of the tooth during the preparation process. It is important to modify the smear layer before applying copal varnish to ensure proper adhesion of the varnish to the tooth surface. Dentine desensitiser is not typically applied before copal varnish, as its main purpose is to reduce tooth sensitivity. Leaving the smear layer intact or removing only the enamel smear layer would not be sufficient for proper adhesion of the copal varnish.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Smear layer is modified\"}"
