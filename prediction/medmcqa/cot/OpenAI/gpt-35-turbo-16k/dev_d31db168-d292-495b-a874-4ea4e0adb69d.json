    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lower 2nd molar refers to the second molar in the lower jaw. To determine its shape, we need to consider the normal anatomy of a lower 2nd molar. A lower 2nd molar typically has four cusps, which are the raised points on the chewing surface of the tooth. These cusps are usually arranged in a '+' shape, with two cusps in the buccal (cheek) side and two cusps in the lingual (tongue) side. Based on this information, we can eliminate options C and D, as they do not match the normal anatomy. Now, we need to determine if the shape is normal or distorted. If the cusps are well-formed and symmetrical, the shape would be considered normal. However, if the cusps are irregular or misshapen, the shape would be considered distorted. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Distorted '+' shape.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
