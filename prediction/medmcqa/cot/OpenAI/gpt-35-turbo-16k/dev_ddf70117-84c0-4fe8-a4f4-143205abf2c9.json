    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to consider the age of the patient. A 10-year-old presenting with a curved back suggests a developmental or acquired cause rather than a degenerative cause. Next, we should evaluate the radiographs. If the radiographs show a structural abnormality present from birth, such as vertebral anomalies or hemivertebrae, the most likely cause would be congenital. If there are signs of neurofibromatosis, such as multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait spots or neurofibromas, then neurofibromatosis would be the most likely cause. If there are no obvious structural abnormalities or signs of neurofibromatosis, and the curvature is not associated with any other underlying condition, then idiopathic scoliosis would be the most likely cause. Finally, if there are signs of muscle weakness or neurological deficits, such as muscle atrophy or abnormal reflexes, then a neuromuscular cause would be the most likely. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Idiopathic\"}"
