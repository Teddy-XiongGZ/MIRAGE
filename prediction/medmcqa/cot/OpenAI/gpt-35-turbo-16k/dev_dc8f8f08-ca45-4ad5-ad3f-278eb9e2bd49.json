    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resistance form in endodontic root canal preparation refers to the shape and design of the cavity form to provide stability and prevent fracture during obturation. The resistance form should prevent the apical root fracture and provide a stable environment for obturation. Option A states that resistance form is the establishment of apical tug back resistance to prevent apical root fracture during obturation. This is incorrect as apical tug back resistance refers to the tactile sensation felt when the instrument reaches the apical constriction, and it is not related to the resistance form. Option B states that resistance form is the cavity form obtained for the application of condenser in vertical compaction. This is incorrect as resistance form is not related to the application of condenser in vertical compaction. Option C states that resistance form is the cavity form designed for the application of condenser in lateral compaction. This is incorrect as resistance form is not related to the application of condenser in lateral compaction. Option D states that resistance form is the cavity form designed to obtain entry of condenser during obturation. This is incorrect as resistance form is not related to the entry of condenser during obturation. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
