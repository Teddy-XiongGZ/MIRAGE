    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When gingiva is seen protruding out of the margins during rubber dam application, there are a few possible reasons to consider. First, edematous gingival tissues can cause the gingiva to appear swollen and protrude out of the margins. Second, if the holes for the rubber dam are placed too far apart, it can cause the gingiva to be stretched and pushed out. Third, using a light-weight dam may not provide enough tension to hold the gingiva in place, allowing it to protrude. Lastly, if the holes are placed too close together, it can also cause the gingiva to be pushed out. Considering these possibilities, the most likely cause for the gingiva protruding out of the margins during rubber dam application is A. Edematous gingival tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
