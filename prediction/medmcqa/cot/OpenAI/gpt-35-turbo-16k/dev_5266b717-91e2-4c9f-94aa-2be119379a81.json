    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to know the details of the Vision 2020 program. Vision 2020 is a global initiative launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) with the goal of eliminating avoidable blindness by the year 2020. The program focuses on various strategies to achieve this goal, including the establishment of vision centers. Now, to determine the number of vision centers under Vision 2020, we need to consider the scale of the program. Since Vision 2020 is a national program, the number of vision centers is likely to be significant, but not excessively large. Looking at the options provided, option A (20) seems too low for a national program. Option B (200) is a possibility, but it may still be on the lower side. Option C (2000) seems more reasonable, as it suggests a larger number of vision centers spread across the country. Option D (20000) appears to be too high for a national program and is unlikely to be the correct answer. Based on this reasoning, the most likely answer is C. 2000.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
