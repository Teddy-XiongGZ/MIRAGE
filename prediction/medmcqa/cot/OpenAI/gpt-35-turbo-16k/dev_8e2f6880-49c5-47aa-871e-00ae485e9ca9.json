    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tissue conditioners are temporary soft liners used in dentistry to improve the fit and comfort of dentures. They are typically used for a short period of time, usually a few weeks, to allow the underlying tissues to heal and adapt to the denture. The purpose of tissue conditioners is to provide a cushioning effect and relieve pressure on the underlying tissues. A. Harden in mouth: Tissue conditioners are designed to remain soft and pliable in the mouth. They do not harden over time. B. Are expensive: The cost of tissue conditioners can vary depending on the specific product and the dental practice. However, the cost of tissue conditioners is generally not a reason for their limited use. C. Are difficult to fabricate: Tissue conditioners are relatively easy to fabricate and can be customized to fit the individual patient's denture. D. Cause ridge resorption: Ridge resorption refers to the loss of bone in the jaw that can occur over time after tooth extraction. Tissue conditioners do not cause ridge resorption. In fact, they can help to minimize pressure on the underlying tissues and potentially slow down the rate of ridge resorption. Based on the above information, the correct answer is D. Cause ridge resorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
