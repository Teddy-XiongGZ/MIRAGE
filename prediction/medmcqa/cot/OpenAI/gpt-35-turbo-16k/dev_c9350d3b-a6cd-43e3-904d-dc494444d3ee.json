    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Plasticizers are substances added to synthetic resins to improve their flexibility, workability, and durability. They are used to reduce the brittleness of the resin and make it more pliable. In dentistry, plasticizers are commonly added to dental resins to prevent polymerization shrinkage, which is the contraction of the resin during the curing process. By reducing shrinkage, plasticizers help to minimize gaps and voids between the resin and the tooth structure, improving the overall quality and longevity of dental restorations. Therefore, the correct answer is C. To prevent polymerization shrinkage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
