    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When managing a patient with hematemesis due to alcoholic liver disease, the first step is to stabilize the patient. This includes ensuring adequate airway, breathing, and circulation. Once the patient is stable, the next step is to identify the source of bleeding. In this case, the most likely source is esophageal varices, which are dilated veins in the esophagus that can bleed. To confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of bleeding, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is typically performed. This allows direct visualization of the varices and the ability to perform interventions such as band ligation or sclerotherapy. Somatostatin infusion is indicated in the management of variceal bleeding as it helps reduce portal pressure and decrease bleeding. A negative nasogastric aspirate does not exclude variceal bleeding as the blood may have already passed into the stomach or the bleeding may be intermittent. Nasogastric tube insertion can provoke variceal bleeding in some cases due to the trauma caused by the tube. Therefore, the false statement regarding the management of this patient is option D: Upper GI endoscopy is done initially.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
