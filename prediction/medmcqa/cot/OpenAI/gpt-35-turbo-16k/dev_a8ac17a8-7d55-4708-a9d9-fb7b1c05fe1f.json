    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The specific plaque hypothesis suggests that only specific micro-organisms are responsible for the pathogenicity of plaque. This means that not all plaque is pathogenic, but rather certain micro-organisms within the plaque are responsible for causing disease. The hypothesis does not state that only specific microbes cause caries, as caries can be caused by a variety of factors. Additionally, the hypothesis does not mention that plaque is pathogenic only when signs of associated disease are present. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Only specific micro-organisms are responsible for the pathogenicity of plaque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
