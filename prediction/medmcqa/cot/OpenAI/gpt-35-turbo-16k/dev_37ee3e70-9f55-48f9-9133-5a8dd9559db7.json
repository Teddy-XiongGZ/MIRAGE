    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alpha thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. It is caused by mutations in the genes that code for the alpha globin chains of hemoglobin. In alpha thalassemia, there is a deficiency or absence of alpha globin chains. This leads to an imbalance in the production of alpha and beta globin chains. The excess beta globin chains form aggregates called inclusion bodies, which can damage red blood cells and lead to anemia. Therefore, the correct answer is B. No alpha chain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
