    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a common condition in premature infants. It is caused by a deficiency of surfactant in the lungs, which leads to difficulty in breathing. Let's analyze the given options:\\n\\nA. History of receiving antenatal corticosteroids: Antenatal corticosteroids are given to pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery to accelerate fetal lung maturation and reduce the risk of RDS. Therefore, this option would not favor RDS.\\n\\nB. Air bronchogram on chest x-ray: Air bronchogram is a radiographic finding seen in conditions such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis, which are not specific to RDS.\\n\\nC. Onset of distress after 6 hours of birth: RDS typically presents within the first few hours of life, not after 6 hours of birth. Therefore, this option would not favor RDS.\\n\\nD. Term birth: RDS is more commonly seen in premature infants, and term infants are less likely to develop RDS. Therefore, this option would not favor RDS.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the answer choice that would favor Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is A. History of receiving antenatal corticosteroids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
