    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apical constriction refers to the narrowing of the root canal at the apex of the tooth. The apical foramen is the opening at the tip of the root canal. To determine the distance between the apical constriction and the apical foramen, we need to consider the anatomy of the tooth. Typically, the apical constriction is located approximately 0.5-1.5mm coronal (towards the crown) to the apical foramen. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 0.5-1.5.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
