    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tracheal secretions should be suctioned for a specific duration to ensure effective removal without causing harm. The suctioning process involves inserting a suction catheter into the trachea to remove secretions. The duration of suctioning should be based on the patient's condition and the amount of secretions present. Generally, suctioning should be performed for a short duration to minimize the risk of complications such as hypoxia or tissue damage. Prolonged suctioning can lead to hypoxia and tissue trauma. A. 10-15 seconds: This duration is relatively short and may not be sufficient to effectively remove tracheal secretions in most cases. It is unlikely to be the correct answer. B. 60 seconds: This duration is longer than the recommended time for suctioning tracheal secretions. Prolonged suctioning can increase the risk of complications. It is unlikely to be the correct answer. C. 30 seconds: This duration falls within the recommended range for suctioning tracheal secretions. It allows for effective removal of secretions without excessive risk of complications. This could be a possible correct answer. D. 3 minutes: This duration is significantly longer than the recommended time for suctioning tracheal secretions. Prolonged suctioning can lead to complications such as hypoxia and tissue damage. It is unlikely to be the correct answer. Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate answer choice is C. 30 seconds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
