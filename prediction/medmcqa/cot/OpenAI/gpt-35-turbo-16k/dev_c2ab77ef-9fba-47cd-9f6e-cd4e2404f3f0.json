    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bone necrosis refers to the death of bone tissue. It can occur when the bone is exposed to high temperatures during drilling. To determine the temperature at which bone necrosis occurs, we need to consider the thermal tolerance of bone tissue. Bone tissue can withstand temperatures up to a certain threshold before necrosis occurs. The correct answer can be determined by considering the temperature range at which bone necrosis is likely to occur. Option A: 65 - This temperature is relatively high and may exceed the thermal tolerance of bone tissue. Option B: 35 - This temperature is relatively low and is unlikely to cause bone necrosis. Option C: 45 - This temperature is within a reasonable range and may be close to the threshold for bone necrosis. Option D: 55 - This temperature is also within a reasonable range and may be close to the threshold for bone necrosis. Based on the options provided, options C and D are the most likely temperatures at which bone necrosis occurs. Therefore, the answer is either C or D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C/D\"}"
