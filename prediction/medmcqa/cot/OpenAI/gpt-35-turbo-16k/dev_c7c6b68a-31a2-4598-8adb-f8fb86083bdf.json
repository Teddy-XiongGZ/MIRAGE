Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not true about metformin. \\n\\nA. Inhibits cellular respiration in mitochondria: This statement is true. Metformin works by inhibiting complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to a decrease in ATP production and an increase in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity.\\n\\nB. Excreted unchanged in urine: This statement is true. Metformin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with approximately 90% of the drug being eliminated this way.\\n\\nC. Reduce hepatic glucose production: This statement is true. One of the main mechanisms of action of metformin is to reduce hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis.\\n\\nD. Used in decompensated heart failure: This statement is not true. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with decompensated heart failure due to the potential risk of lactic acidosis. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
