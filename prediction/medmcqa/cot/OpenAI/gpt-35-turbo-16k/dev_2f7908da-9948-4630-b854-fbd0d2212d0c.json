    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chromic gut and plain gut are both types of absorbable sutures commonly used in deep wounds. To determine the advantage of chromic gut over plain gut in deep wounds, we need to consider the characteristics of each suture. A. Greater strength: Both chromic gut and plain gut have similar strength and are suitable for use in deep wounds. Therefore, this is not the advantage of chromic gut over plain gut. B. Greater ease of use: Ease of use is subjective and can vary depending on the surgeon's preference. It is not a specific advantage of chromic gut over plain gut. C. Delayed resorption: Chromic gut is treated with chromium salts, which slows down the rate of absorption compared to plain gut. This delayed resorption can be advantageous in deep wounds where prolonged suture support is desired. Therefore, this is a potential advantage of chromic gut over plain gut. D. Less tissue irritation: Both chromic gut and plain gut are made from natural materials and are generally well-tolerated by the body. However, chromic gut may cause less tissue irritation due to its slower absorption rate. Therefore, this is another potential advantage of chromic gut over plain gut. Considering the above points, the correct answer is D. Less tissue irritation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
