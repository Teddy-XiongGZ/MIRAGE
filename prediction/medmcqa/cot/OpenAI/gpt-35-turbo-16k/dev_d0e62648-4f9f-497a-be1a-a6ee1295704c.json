    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The highest level of evidence is determined by the quality and reliability of the study design. In this case, we are looking for the highest level of evidence. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Case control studies: Case control studies are observational studies that compare individuals with a specific condition (cases) to individuals without the condition (controls). While they can provide valuable information, they are generally considered to be of lower quality and have a higher risk of bias compared to other study designs.\\n\\nB. Meta-analysis: Meta-analysis is a statistical technique that combines the results of multiple studies on a specific topic to generate a more precise estimate of the effect. While meta-analyses can provide valuable insights, they are not considered a study design themselves and are dependent on the quality of the included studies.\\n\\nC. Cohort studies: Cohort studies are observational studies that follow a group of individuals over time to determine the incidence of outcomes. They are generally considered to be of higher quality compared to case control studies, but they still have limitations.\\n\\nD. Systematic review: A systematic review is a comprehensive and unbiased review of the available evidence on a specific topic. It involves a rigorous search and evaluation of multiple studies and aims to provide a summary of the best available evidence. Systematic reviews are considered to be of high quality and are often used as a basis for clinical guidelines and decision-making.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the highest level of evidence is seen in systematic reviews, as they involve a thorough evaluation of multiple studies and provide a summary of the best available evidence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Systematic review\"}"
