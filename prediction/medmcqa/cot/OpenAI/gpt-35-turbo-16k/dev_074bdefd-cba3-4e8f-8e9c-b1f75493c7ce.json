    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anodontia refers to the congenital absence of teeth. It is a condition where a person is born without any teeth. To determine which part of the body is affected by anodontia, we need to understand the normal development of teeth. Teeth develop from the dental lamina, which is an embryonic structure that forms in the oral cavity. The dental lamina gives rise to the tooth buds, which eventually develop into teeth. The dental lamina is present in both the maxilla (upper jaw) and the mandible (lower jaw). However, the alveolar bone, which is the bone that supports the teeth, is specific to the jaws. The cranium, on the other hand, refers to the skull. Given that anodontia is the absence of teeth, it primarily affects the development of teeth in both the maxilla and the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A and B\"}"
