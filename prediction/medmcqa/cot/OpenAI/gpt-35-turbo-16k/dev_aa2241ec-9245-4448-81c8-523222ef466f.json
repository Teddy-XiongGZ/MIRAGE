    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the false statement about cast cobalt alloys, we need to evaluate each statement one by one. \\n\\nA. The modulus of elasticity refers to the stiffness of a material. If cast cobalt alloys have a modulus of elasticity twice that of gold alloys, it means they are stiffer than gold alloys. \\n\\nB. If cast cobalt alloys are more rigid than gold alloys, it supports the statement made in option A. \\n\\nC. Ductility refers to the ability of a material to deform under tensile stress. If cast cobalt alloys have higher ductility than gold alloys, it means they can deform more before breaking. \\n\\nD. The proportional limit is the maximum stress a material can withstand without deviating from linear elastic behavior. If cast cobalt alloys have a lower proportional limit than gold alloys, it means they can withstand less stress before permanent deformation occurs. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the false statement is option C, as cast cobalt alloys do not have higher ductility than gold alloys.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
