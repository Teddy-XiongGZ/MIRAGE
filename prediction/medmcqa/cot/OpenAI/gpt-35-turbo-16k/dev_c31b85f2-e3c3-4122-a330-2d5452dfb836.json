    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Counter bevel is a type of bevel that is given to the tooth surface to provide additional retention for a dental restoration. It involves creating a beveled edge on the tooth surface. The purpose of a counter bevel is to prevent the restoration from dislodging or breaking off. In order to determine where a counter bevel should not be given, we need to consider the factors that may affect the retention of the restoration. The occlusal surface of a premolar is subjected to significant forces during chewing, so a counter bevel should not be given on this surface as it may compromise the strength of the restoration. Similarly, the lingual surface of a premolar is also subjected to forces during tongue movements, so a counter bevel should not be given on this surface either. However, the facial surface of a premolar is less likely to be subjected to significant forces, so a counter bevel can be given on this surface. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Facial surface of premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
