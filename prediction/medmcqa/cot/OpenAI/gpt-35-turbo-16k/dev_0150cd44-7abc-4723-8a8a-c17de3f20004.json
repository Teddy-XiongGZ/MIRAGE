    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biomineralization is a process by which inorganic metals are incorporated in the body and made a part of biological structures. To determine the example of biomineralization, we need to identify a biological structure that contains inorganic metals. A. Pinna (anatomy): The pinna is the visible part of the external ear in humans and some other mammals. It is composed of cartilage and does not contain inorganic metals. B. Hooves of cattle: The hooves of cattle are made of keratin, a protein, and do not contain inorganic metals. C. Honeycomb: Honeycomb is a structure made by bees to store honey and raise their young. It is composed of beeswax, which is a mixture of lipids and does not contain inorganic metals. D. Mollusc shell: Mollusc shells, such as those of snails and clams, are examples of biomineralization. They are composed of calcium carbonate, which is an inorganic mineral. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Mollusc shell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
