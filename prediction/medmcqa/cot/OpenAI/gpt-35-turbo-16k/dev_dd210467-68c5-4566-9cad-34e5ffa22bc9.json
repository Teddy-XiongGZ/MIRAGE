    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Premolars are the teeth located between the canines and molars. They have a similar shape and function to the permanent premolars. To determine which primary tooth resembles a premolar, we need to consider the location and characteristics of the primary teeth. The upper and lower molars are located at the back of the mouth, while the premolars are located between the canines and molars. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B, which are both molars. Now, we need to compare the characteristics of the remaining options, which are the upper 2nd molar (option C) and the lower 2nd molar (option D). The upper 2nd molar is typically larger and has a more complex shape compared to the lower 2nd molar. The lower 2nd molar is usually smaller and has a simpler shape, which is more similar to a premolar. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Lower 2nd molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
