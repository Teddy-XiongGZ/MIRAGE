    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best choice for core built up on a molar tooth, we need to consider the properties and requirements of the material. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Light cure resin lacks sufficient strength for a core: This option suggests that light cure resin is not strong enough for a core. We need a material that can provide sufficient strength to support the tooth structure.\\n\\nB. Core made with a light cure resin would be too opaque and esthetically unacceptable: This option suggests that a core made with light cure resin would be aesthetically unacceptable due to its opacity. However, the question does not mention anything about the esthetic requirements of the core.\\n\\nC. Core made with a light cure resin would be too brittle and would fracture easily: This option suggests that a core made with light cure resin would be brittle and prone to fracture. We need a material that can provide durability and resistance to fracture.\\n\\nD. Its lower viscosity allows free flow of resin also around pins and post: This option suggests that the lower viscosity of the chemically cured composite allows for better flow around pins and posts. This can be beneficial for achieving a secure and stable core.\\n\\nBased on the given options, it seems that option D provides a logical reason for using a chemically cured composite for core built up on a molar tooth. It offers the advantage of lower viscosity, allowing for better flow around pins and posts, which can contribute to a more secure and stable core.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
