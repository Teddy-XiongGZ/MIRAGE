    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which nonaqueous elastomeric impression material has the least shelf life, we need to consider the properties and characteristics of each material. Shelf life refers to the period of time during which a material can be stored and remain usable. A. Poly ether: Poly ether impression materials generally have a longer shelf life compared to other elastomeric materials. They are known for their stability and resistance to degradation over time. B. Addition silicone: Addition silicone impression materials also have a relatively long shelf life. They are stable and can maintain their properties for an extended period. C. Condensation silicone: Condensation silicone impression materials have a shorter shelf life compared to poly ether and addition silicone. They are more prone to degradation and changes in properties over time. D. Polysulphide: Polysulphide impression materials have the shortest shelf life among the options provided. They are known to deteriorate relatively quickly and may require more frequent replacement. Based on the properties and characteristics of these materials, the answer is D. Polysulphide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
