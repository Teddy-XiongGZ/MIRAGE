    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formula for the standard error of the mean is given by the square root of the variance divided by the sample size. The formula for the standard error of the difference of means is similar, but it involves the variances and sample sizes of two different groups. The formula for the standard error of proportions is the square root of the product of the proportion of success and the proportion of failure, divided by the sample size. The formula for the standard error of the difference in proportions is similar, but it involves the proportions and sample sizes of two different groups. In this case, the square root of pq/n indicates the standard error of proportions, where p and q are the proportions of success and failure, respectively, and n is the sample size. Therefore, the answer is C. Standard error of proportions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
