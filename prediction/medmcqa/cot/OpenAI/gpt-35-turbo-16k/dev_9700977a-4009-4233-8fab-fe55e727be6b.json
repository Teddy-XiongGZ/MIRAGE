    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Paul-Bunnell test is commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis. It is based on the detection of heterophile antibodies in the patient's serum. These antibodies are produced in response to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis. The test works by agglutination of sheep or horse red blood cells (SRBCs or HRBCs) in the presence of the patient's serum. The agglutination occurs due to the interaction between the heterophile antibodies and antigens on the surface of the SRBCs or HRBCs. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Heterophile antibody test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
