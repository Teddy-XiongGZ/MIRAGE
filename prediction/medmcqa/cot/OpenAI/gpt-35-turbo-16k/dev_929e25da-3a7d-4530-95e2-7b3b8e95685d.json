    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Functional appliances are orthodontic devices that are used to correct malocclusion and improve jaw function. They work by exerting forces on the teeth and jaws to stimulate growth and development. The term 'tissue-borne' refers to appliances that are primarily supported by the soft tissues of the mouth, such as the lips, cheeks, and tongue, rather than being anchored to the teeth or bone. A. Activator: The activator is a removable functional appliance that is supported by the teeth and the soft tissues of the mouth. It is not primarily tissue-borne, so it is not the correct answer. B. Bionator: The bionator is a removable functional appliance that is also supported by the teeth and the soft tissues of the mouth. It is not primarily tissue-borne, so it is not the correct answer. C. Twin block: The twin block is a removable functional appliance that is primarily supported by the soft tissues of the mouth. It is designed to be tissue-borne, making it a potential correct answer. D. Frankel: The Frankel appliance is a removable functional appliance that is primarily supported by the soft tissues of the mouth. It is designed to be tissue-borne, making it a potential correct answer. Based on the information provided, both the Twin block and Frankel appliances can be considered tissue-borne functional appliances. Therefore, the correct answer is either C. Twin block or D. Frankel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C/D\"}"
