    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The facial bones are prone to fractures due to trauma or injury. To determine which facial bone is most prone to fracture, we need to consider the anatomy and common mechanisms of injury. The mandible is the lower jawbone and is commonly fractured due to direct blows or trauma to the face. The nasal bone is located in the upper part of the nose and is also prone to fractures, especially from nasal trauma or fractures of the nasal bridge. The zygoma, also known as the cheekbone, is located on the lateral aspect of the face and can be fractured from direct blows or trauma to the cheek. The frontal bone forms the forehead and is less prone to fractures compared to the other facial bones. Considering the common mechanisms of injury and the location of the bones, the most prone to fracture among the given options is the nasal bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Nasal\"}"
