    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To remove working side interference, we need to reduce the contact between the working side cusps and the opposing teeth. The guiding cusps are the cusps on the working side that guide the movement of the mandible during chewing. The supporting cusps are the cusps on the opposing teeth that support the occlusal forces. Therefore, reducing the contact between both the guiding cusps and the supporting cusps will help remove the working side interference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
