    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Strain is a measure of the deformation or elongation of a material when subjected to an applied load or force. It is not the applied load or force itself (choice A), but rather the resulting deformation (choice B). Strain is not an external force opposing the applied load (choice C) or an internal force opposing the applied load (choice D). Therefore, the correct answer is B. A deformation resulting from an applied load.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
