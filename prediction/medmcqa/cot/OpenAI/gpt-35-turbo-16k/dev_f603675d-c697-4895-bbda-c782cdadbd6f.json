    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucocorticoid deficiency refers to a deficiency in the hormone cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal glands. Cortisol plays a crucial role in regulating various body functions. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not a feature of glucocorticoid deficiency. \\n\\nA. Fever: Glucocorticoid deficiency can lead to a decrease in immune function, making individuals more susceptible to infections. Infections can cause fever, so fever can be a feature of glucocorticoid deficiency. \\n\\nB. Hyperkalemia: Glucocorticoids help regulate electrolyte balance, including potassium levels. A deficiency in glucocorticoids can lead to an increase in potassium levels, resulting in hyperkalemia. Therefore, hyperkalemia can be a feature of glucocorticoid deficiency. \\n\\nC. Postural hypotension: Glucocorticoids play a role in maintaining blood pressure. A deficiency in glucocorticoids can lead to low blood pressure, especially upon standing, resulting in postural hypotension. Therefore, postural hypotension can be a feature of glucocorticoid deficiency. \\n\\nD. Weight loss: Glucocorticoids have an anabolic effect, meaning they promote the synthesis of proteins and the storage of energy. A deficiency in glucocorticoids can lead to weight loss due to decreased protein synthesis and increased breakdown of muscle tissue. Therefore, weight loss can be a feature of glucocorticoid deficiency. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is A. Fever.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
