    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radio-resistant cells are cells that are able to withstand the damaging effects of radiation. In the retina, the cells that are known to be radio-resistant are the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. These cells are located between the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) and the choroid, and they play a crucial role in supporting the function of the photoreceptor cells. The ganglion cell layer and bipolar cells are not considered to be radio-resistant cells in the retina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
