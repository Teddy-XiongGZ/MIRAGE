    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question mentions that the role of one of the rotator cuff muscles has been ignored or given less importance. To determine which muscle fits this description, we need to consider the knowledge and attention given to each of the rotator cuff muscles. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Supraspinatus: The supraspinatus muscle is one of the most well-known and studied rotator cuff muscles. It plays a crucial role in shoulder abduction and is often implicated in rotator cuff injuries.\\n\\nB. Infraspinatus: The infraspinatus muscle is also a well-known rotator cuff muscle. It is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder and is commonly involved in rotator cuff tears.\\n\\nC. Teres minor: The teres minor muscle is another rotator cuff muscle that assists in external rotation of the shoulder. While it may not receive as much attention as the supraspinatus or infraspinatus, it is still considered an important muscle.\\n\\nD. Subscapularis: The subscapularis muscle is the only muscle left that has not been mentioned yet. Based on the information provided, it is likely that the subscapularis muscle is the 'forgotten rotator cuff muscle' as it has received less attention or importance compared to the other rotator cuff muscles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Subscapularis\"}"
