    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is a non-parametric test, we need to understand the characteristics of non-parametric tests. Non-parametric tests are used when the data does not meet the assumptions of parametric tests, such as normal distribution or equal variances. Non-parametric tests do not rely on specific population parameters and are based on ranks or categories of data. Now let's evaluate each option: A. Pearson correlation is a parametric test that measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. B. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a parametric test used to compare means of three or more groups. C. Mann-Whitney test is a non-parametric test used to compare the medians of two independent groups. D. Student t-test is a parametric test used to compare the means of two independent groups. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Mann-Whitney test, as it is the only option that is a non-parametric test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
