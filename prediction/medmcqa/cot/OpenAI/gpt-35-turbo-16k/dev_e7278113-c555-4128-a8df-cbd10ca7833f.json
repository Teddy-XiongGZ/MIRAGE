    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to determine the elimination rate constant (k) using the given information. The elimination rate constant can be calculated using the formula k = (0.693 / t1/2), where t1/2 is the half-life of the drug. Since the drug follows first order kinetics, the half-life can be calculated using the formula t1/2 = (0.693 / k). Given that 75 mg of the drug is eliminated in 90 minutes, we can calculate the elimination rate constant as k = (0.693 / 90). Next, we can calculate the half-life as t1/2 = (0.693 / k). Once we have the half-life, we can use it to calculate the amount of drug remaining after 6 hours using the formula A = A0 * (0.5)^(t / t1/2), where A0 is the initial amount of drug administered, t is the time elapsed, and A is the amount of drug remaining.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 30 mg\"}"
