    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a patient presents with altered sensorium, the first step is to assess the patient's vital signs and stabilize them if necessary. Once the patient is stable, the next step is to perform a thorough physical examination to look for any signs of infection, trauma, or other underlying causes. In this case, the question is asking which tests should not be done. A. Complete blood counts (CBC): This test can help identify any abnormalities in the blood, such as infections or anemia, which could be contributing to the altered sensorium. Therefore, it should be done. B. Random blood sugar: This test is important to check for any abnormalities in blood glucose levels, as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can cause altered sensorium. Therefore, it should be done. C. Lumbar puncture: This test involves inserting a needle into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. It is typically done to evaluate for infections or bleeding in the central nervous system. In a patient with altered sensorium, a lumbar puncture may be necessary to rule out meningitis or encephalitis. Therefore, it should be done. D. Non-contrast CT head: This test is commonly performed in patients with altered sensorium to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or bleeding in the brain. It can help identify conditions such as stroke, hemorrhage, or tumors. Therefore, it should be done. Based on the above reasoning, the test that should not be done in this case is the lumbar puncture (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
