    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Papain is a proteolytic enzyme that cleaves IgG antibodies. It cleaves the antibody molecule into three fragments: two Fab fragments and one Fc fragment. The Fab fragments contain the antigen-binding sites, while the Fc fragment is responsible for effector functions such as complement activation and binding to Fc receptors. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 1 Fc and 2 Fab fragments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
