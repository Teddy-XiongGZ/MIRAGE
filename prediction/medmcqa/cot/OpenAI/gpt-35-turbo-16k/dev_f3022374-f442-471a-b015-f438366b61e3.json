    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mercury toxicity can occur through various routes of exposure. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Skin contact with mercury: While skin contact with mercury can lead to absorption of small amounts of mercury, it is not the greatest potential hazard.\\n\\nB. Inhalation of mercury vapours: Inhalation of mercury vapours is a significant route of exposure and can lead to the greatest potential hazard of mercury toxicity.\\n\\nC. During amalgam restoration: Amalgam restoration involves the use of dental amalgam, which contains mercury. However, the exposure during this procedure is usually limited and controlled, making it less likely to be the greatest potential hazard.\\n\\nD. Ingestion of amalgam scrap during removal: Ingestion of amalgam scrap during removal can lead to exposure to mercury, but it is not the greatest potential hazard compared to inhalation of mercury vapours.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the correct answer is B. Inhalation of mercury vapours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
