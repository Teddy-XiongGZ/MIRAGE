    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To classify a traumatized tooth as nonvital with or without crown fracture, we need to refer to the Ellis classification system. The Ellis classification system categorizes tooth fractures based on the involvement of the pulp. Class-III fractures involve the pulp exposure due to crown fracture, Class-IV fractures involve the pulp exposure due to crown and root fractures, Class-V fractures involve the pulp exposure due to root fracture, and Class-VII fractures involve the avulsion of the tooth. Since the question mentions a nonvital tooth, it is likely that the pulp is already necrotic or nonvital. Therefore, the correct classification for a traumatized tooth nonvital with or without crown fracture would be Class-IV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Class-IV\"}"
