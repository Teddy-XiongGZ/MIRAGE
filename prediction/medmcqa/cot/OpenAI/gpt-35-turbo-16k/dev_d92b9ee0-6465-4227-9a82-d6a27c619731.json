    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a caries-free individual, the saliva plays an important role in maintaining oral health. Saliva helps to neutralize acids produced by bacteria in the mouth, which can contribute to the development of dental caries (tooth decay). The buffering capacity of saliva refers to its ability to resist changes in pH when acids are introduced. Step 1: Since the individual is caries-free, it suggests that their saliva is effective in preventing tooth decay. This implies that the saliva has a good buffering capacity for acids. Step 2: Low buffering capacity would mean that the saliva is not able to neutralize acids effectively, which would increase the risk of tooth decay. Step 3: Medium buffering capacity would suggest that the saliva can partially neutralize acids, but may not be as effective as a high buffering capacity. Step 4: High buffering capacity would indicate that the saliva is able to effectively neutralize acids, reducing the risk of tooth decay. Based on this reasoning, the answer is C. High buffering capacity for acids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
