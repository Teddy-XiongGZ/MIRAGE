    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the major drawback of pro-root MTA and how to decrease its setting time. To answer this, we need to consider the options provided. Option A: 3% of NaOH - NaOH is a strong base and adding it to MTA may increase the setting time rather than decrease it. Option B: 3% NaCl - NaCl is a common salt and it is unlikely to have any effect on the setting time of MTA. Option C: 5% CaCl - Calcium chloride (CaCl) is known to accelerate the setting time of MTA. Therefore, adding 5% CaCl to pro-root MTA can decrease its setting time. Option D: Distilled Water - Water is the main component of MTA and adding more water is unlikely to decrease the setting time. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is C. 5% CaCl.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
