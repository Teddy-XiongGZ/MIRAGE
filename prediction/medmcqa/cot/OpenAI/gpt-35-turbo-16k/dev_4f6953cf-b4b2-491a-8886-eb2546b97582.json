    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In case of a deep carious lesion, incomplete debridement is done for specific reasons. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Allow secondary dentin formation first: Secondary dentin formation occurs as a response to dental caries. However, incomplete debridement is not necessary for this process to occur.\\n\\nB. To seal the cavity and create an aseptic field: Incomplete debridement may not effectively seal the cavity and create an aseptic field. Complete removal of carious tissue is usually required for proper cavity preparation.\\n\\nC. Prevent pulp exposure and allow a thin layer of dentin to remain: This option seems plausible. Incomplete debridement can help prevent pulp exposure and allow a thin layer of dentin to remain, providing some protection to the pulp.\\n\\nD. Avoid microleakage: Incomplete debridement may not effectively prevent microleakage. Complete removal of carious tissue is usually necessary to ensure proper sealing of the cavity.\\n\\nConsidering the above explanations, option C seems to be the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
