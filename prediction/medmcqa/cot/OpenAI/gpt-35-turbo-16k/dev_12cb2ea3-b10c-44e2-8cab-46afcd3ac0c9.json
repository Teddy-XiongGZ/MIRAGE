    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The working time of impression material refers to the period during which the material can be manipulated and placed in the mouth before it sets. To determine the working time, we need to understand the different stages of the material's setting process. Option A states that the working time is after the start of appearing elastic properties of the impression material. This means that the material has already started to set and become elastic. Option B states that the working time is just after the start of appearing elastic properties. This implies that the material has just begun to set and become elastic. Option C states that the working time is the time from the start of mixing until just before the start of appearing elastic properties. This suggests that the working time includes the period of mixing and manipulating the material before it starts to set. Option D mentions the loss of lustre of the impression material, which is unrelated to the working time. Based on these explanations, the most appropriate answer is option C. The working time of impression material includes the time from the start of mixing until just before the start of appearing elastic properties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
