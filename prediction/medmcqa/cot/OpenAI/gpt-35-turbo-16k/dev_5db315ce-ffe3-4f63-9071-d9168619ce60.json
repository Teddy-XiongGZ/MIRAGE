    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), severe acidosis can occur due to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Acidosis is characterized by a decrease in blood pH. To counteract acidosis, the administration of a substance that can buffer the excess acid and increase blood pH is required. Among the given options, the most appropriate method to counteract acidosis during CPR is to administer sodium bicarbonate intravenously. Sodium bicarbonate is an alkaline substance that can act as a buffer and help restore the blood pH to normal levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sodium bicarbonate intravenously\"}"
