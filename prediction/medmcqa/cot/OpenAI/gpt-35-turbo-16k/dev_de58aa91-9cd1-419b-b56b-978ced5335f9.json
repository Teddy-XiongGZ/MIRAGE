    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Von-Gierk's disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I), is a metabolic disorder characterized by the inability to break down glycogen into glucose. This leads to hypoglycemia and an accumulation of glycogen in various tissues. Ketosis is not typically seen in GSD I because the body is unable to produce ketone bodies due to the lack of glucose availability. Therefore, the associated finding of ketosis would be unexpected in a patient with Von-Gierk's disease. A. There is hypoglycemia - This is a characteristic finding in Von-Gierk's disease due to the inability to break down glycogen into glucose. B. Have low blood sugar levels - This is correct, as hypoglycemia is a characteristic finding in Von-Gierk's disease. C. Oxaloacetate is required for gluconeogenesis - This is correct, as oxaloacetate is an important intermediate in the gluconeogenesis pathway. D. Low fat mobilization - This is incorrect, as patients with Von-Gierk's disease have increased fat mobilization due to the inability to utilize glucose for energy production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
