    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute pyelonephritis is an infection of the kidneys, usually caused by bacteria. To diagnose acute pyelonephritis, specific investigations are required to confirm the presence of infection. The most specific investigation for acute pyelonephritis is the presence of bacteria in the gram stain. This test directly visualizes the bacteria in a sample from the patient's urine. Histopathological examination is not specific for acute pyelonephritis and is usually not necessary for diagnosis. Leucocyte esterase test and nitrite test are commonly used to screen for urinary tract infections, but they are not as specific as the gram stain for diagnosing acute pyelonephritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
