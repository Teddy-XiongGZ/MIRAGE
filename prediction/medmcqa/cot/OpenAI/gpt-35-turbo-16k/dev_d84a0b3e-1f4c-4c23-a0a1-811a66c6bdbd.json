    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Staghorn calculi are large kidney stones that occupy the renal pelvis and extend into at least two calyces. Mild hydronephrosis indicates that there is some dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to obstruction caused by the staghorn calculus. The treatment of choice for a patient with a staghorn calculus with mild hydronephrosis is typically percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). PCNL involves making a small incision in the back and using a nephroscope to remove the stone. This procedure is highly effective for large stones and allows for complete removal. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) uses shock waves to break up the stone, but it may not be as effective for staghorn calculi. Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) involves using a flexible ureteroscope to access and remove the stone, but it may not be suitable for large staghorn calculi. Open surgery is a more invasive option and is typically reserved for cases where other treatments have failed or are not feasible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. PCNL\"}"
