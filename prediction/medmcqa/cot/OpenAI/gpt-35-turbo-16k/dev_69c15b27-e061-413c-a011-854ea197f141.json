    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cranial nerves IX, X, and XI are the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves, respectively. To determine the nucleus in the brain that is common to these cranial nerves, we need to identify the nuclei associated with each nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) originates from the nucleus ambiguus, the vagus nerve (X) also originates from the nucleus ambiguus, and the accessory nerve (XI) originates from the spinal accessory nucleus. Therefore, the nucleus in the brain that is common to these cranial nerves is the nucleus ambiguus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Nucleus ambiguus\"}"
