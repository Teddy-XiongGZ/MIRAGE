    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the non-invasive method to measure blood flow, we need to consider the options provided. \\n\\nA. Electric pulp test: This test is used to assess the vitality of dental pulp and is not directly related to measuring blood flow. \\n\\nB. Percussion: Percussion is a technique used to assess the tenderness or pain in a specific area by tapping on it. It is not a method to measure blood flow. \\n\\nC. Radiograph: Radiographs, also known as X-rays, are imaging techniques used to visualize internal structures. While they can provide information about blood vessels, they do not directly measure blood flow. \\n\\nD. Laser Doppler flowmetry: Laser Doppler flowmetry is a non-invasive method used to measure blood flow in tissues. It works by using laser light to detect the movement of red blood cells. This is the correct answer as it directly measures blood flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
