    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Left ventricular hypertrophy and central cyanosis in a five-year-old child are suggestive of a congenital heart defect. Let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. Tricuspid atresia: Tricuspid atresia is a congenital heart defect where the tricuspid valve is completely closed or absent. It usually presents with cyanosis, but left ventricular hypertrophy is not a typical finding.\\n\\nB. Eisenmenger syndrome: Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when a congenital heart defect with a left-to-right shunt leads to pulmonary hypertension and reversal of the shunt, resulting in cyanosis. However, left ventricular hypertrophy is not a characteristic feature of Eisenmenger syndrome.\\n\\nC. Tetralogy of Fallot: Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by four abnormalities, including right ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy is not a typical finding in Tetralogy of Fallot.\\n\\nD. Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage: Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect to the left atrium. It can present with cyanosis, but left ventricular hypertrophy is not a characteristic feature.\\n\\nBased on the given information, the most probable diagnosis is Tricuspid atresia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
