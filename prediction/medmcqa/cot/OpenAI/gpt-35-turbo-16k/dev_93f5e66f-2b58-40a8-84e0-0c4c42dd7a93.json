    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Golgi tendon organs are sensory receptors located in the tendons of muscles. They are responsible for detecting changes in tension or force within the muscle. When the muscle contracts and generates tension, the Golgi tendon organs are activated and send signals to the brain. Therefore, the Golgi tendon organs are specifically used to detect the tension of the muscle. So, the correct answer is C. Tension of muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
