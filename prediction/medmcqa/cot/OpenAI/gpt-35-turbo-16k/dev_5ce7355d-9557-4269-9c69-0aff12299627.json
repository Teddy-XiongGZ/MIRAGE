    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluorosis is a condition that occurs due to excessive intake of fluoride during tooth development. It leads to the formation of white or brown spots on the teeth. Deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, are the first set of teeth that erupt in children and are eventually replaced by permanent teeth. To determine why deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis, we need to consider the factors that contribute to fluorosis. Option A states that the placenta acts as a barrier. However, the placenta is only present during pregnancy and does not have a direct role in the development of deciduous teeth. Therefore, option A is unlikely to be the correct answer. Option B suggests that fluoride is taken up by the fast-growing skeletal tissue. While fluoride is indeed taken up by skeletal tissue, it does not explain why deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis. The development of fluorosis is specific to the teeth and is not solely dependent on skeletal tissue growth. Therefore, option B is also unlikely to be the correct answer. Option C states that the calcification time of deciduous teeth is less. This is a plausible explanation for why deciduous teeth do not show fluorosis. Deciduous teeth have a shorter calcification time compared to permanent teeth, which means they are exposed to fluoride for a shorter duration during development. This reduced exposure to fluoride decreases the likelihood of fluorosis occurring in deciduous teeth. Considering the above explanations, option C seems to be the most reasonable answer. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
