    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the tooth with greater crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane. The faciolingual dissecting plane is a vertical plane that divides the tooth into two halves - the facial half and the lingual half. The distal aspect of a tooth refers to the side that is away from the midline of the dental arch. To determine which tooth has greater crown bulk distal to the faciolingual dissecting plane, we need to consider the anatomy of each tooth and its position in the dental arch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
