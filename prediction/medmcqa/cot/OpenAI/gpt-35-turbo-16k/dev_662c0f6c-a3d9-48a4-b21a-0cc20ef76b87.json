    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Buffering capacity is the ability of a solution to resist changes in pH. It depends on the concentration of the weak acid and its conjugate base in the solution. The higher the concentration of the weak acid and its conjugate base, the higher the buffering capacity. Histidine, Cysteine, Tyrosine, and Arginine are all amino acids that can act as weak acids and their conjugate bases. To determine which one has the maximum buffering capacity, we need to consider their pKa values. The lower the pKa value, the stronger the acid. Therefore, the amino acid with the lowest pKa value will have the highest buffering capacity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
