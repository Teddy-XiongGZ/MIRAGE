    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The PCL (Posterior Cruciate Ligament) is one of the four major ligaments of the knee joint. It is located in the back of the knee and connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone). The PCL functions to prevent excessive posterior translation (backward movement) of the tibia relative to the femur. A. It is not an extra synovial structure. The PCL is a ligament, which means it is a band of fibrous tissue that connects bones together. B. This statement is true. The PCL is one of the primary restraints for posterior dislocation of the knee joint. It helps to stabilize the knee and prevent the tibia from sliding too far backward. C. This statement is false. The primary restraint for internal rotation around the knee joint is the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), not the PCL. D. This statement is true. The PCL is attached to the medial (inner) femoral condyle, along with the lateral (outer) femoral condyle. Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is C. Primary restrain for internal rotation around the knee joint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
