    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which muscle is responsible for the retraction of the mandible, we need to understand the anatomy and function of the muscles involved. The muscles that move the mandible are primarily located in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for protrusion and lateral movement of the mandible, not retraction. The temporalis muscle is a large muscle that covers the temporal bone and is responsible for elevating and retracting the mandible. The medial pterygoid muscle is responsible for elevating and protruding the mandible, not retraction. The masseter muscle is a powerful muscle that elevates the mandible, but it is not primarily responsible for retraction. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Temporalis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
