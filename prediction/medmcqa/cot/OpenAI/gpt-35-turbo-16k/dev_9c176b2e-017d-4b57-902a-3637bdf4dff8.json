    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Efferent arteriole constriction refers to the narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood away from the glomerulus in the kidney. This constriction can have various effects on the renal system. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Decreased GFR: Efferent arteriole constriction actually leads to an increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) because it increases the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus, pushing more fluid through the filtration membrane. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\\n\\nB. Increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure: This is the correct answer. Efferent arteriole constriction increases the resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus, resulting in increased hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus. This increased pressure favors filtration.\\n\\nC. Decreased blood flow in peritubular vessels: Efferent arteriole constriction actually increases the blood flow in peritubular vessels. Since less blood is leaving the glomerulus, more blood is available to flow through the peritubular capillaries. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\\n\\nD. Increased oncotic pressure in peritubular vessels: Efferent arteriole constriction does not directly affect the oncotic pressure in peritubular vessels. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
