    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrous oxide is commonly used as an adjunct to other general anesthesia agents, but not as a standalone agent. Let's evaluate each option to determine the correct answer. A. Difficulty in maintaining an adequate oxygen concentration: Nitrous oxide is a weak anesthetic and does not provide sufficient oxygenation on its own. B. Expense of the agent and its exposure hazards: While cost and exposure hazards may be factors, they are not the primary reason why nitrous oxide is not used as a standalone agent. C. Adverse effect on liver: Nitrous oxide does not have a significant adverse effect on the liver. D. Poor analgesic property: Nitrous oxide is primarily used for its analgesic properties rather than its anesthetic properties. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Poor analgesic property.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
