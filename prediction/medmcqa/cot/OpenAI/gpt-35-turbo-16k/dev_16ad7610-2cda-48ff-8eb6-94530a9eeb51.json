    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine fetal lung maturity, we need to consider various factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Lecithin/Sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio >2: This is a marker of fetal lung maturity. A ratio greater than 2 indicates mature lungs.\\n\\nB. Positive shake test: The shake test is used to assess the presence of surfactant in the amniotic fluid. A positive result indicates the presence of surfactant, which is a marker of fetal lung maturity.\\n\\nC. Increased phosphatidyl glycerol: Phosphatidyl glycerol is a phospholipid that appears in the amniotic fluid as the lungs mature. An increased level of phosphatidyl glycerol is indicative of fetal lung maturity.\\n\\nD. Blue cells in Nile Blue Test: The Nile Blue Test is used to assess the presence of phosphatidyl glycerol in the amniotic fluid. Blue cells indicate the presence of phosphatidyl glycerol, which is a marker of fetal lung maturity.\\n\\nBased on this information, the option that does not indicate fetal lung maturity is D. Blue cells in Nile Blue Test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
