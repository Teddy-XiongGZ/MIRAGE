    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening infection that involves the submandibular space. It is characterized by rapid and progressive swelling of the floor of the mouth and the submandibular region. The infection can spread rapidly and compromise the airway. Therefore, the first step when a patient with Ludwig's angina reports to the emergency room is to secure the airway. This can be achieved by performing a tracheostomy under general anesthesia. This option ensures immediate airway control and allows for better visualization and access to the infected area. Incision and drainage under local anesthesia may be necessary later in the management of Ludwig's angina, but it is not the first step. I/V antibiotics and fluids are important in the management of Ludwig's angina, but they do not address the immediate need for airway control. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Tracheostomy under general anesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
