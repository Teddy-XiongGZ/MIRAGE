    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The release of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic terminal is a process known as exocytosis. This process is triggered by the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal. Therefore, to inhibit the release of synaptic vesicles, we need to prevent calcium influx into the nerve terminal. Option C, prevention of calcium influx, is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
