    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given results, we can analyze the effects of the unknown drug on different parameters. 1. Heart rate: The heart rate in the new drug treated group is 72, which is higher than the heart rate in the placebo treated group (86). This suggests that the new drug may have a stimulatory effect on the heart. 2. Blood pressure: The systolic blood pressure in the new drug treated group is 150, while it is 110 in the placebo treated group. This indicates that the new drug may increase the systolic blood pressure. 3. Diastolic blood pressure: The diastolic blood pressure in the new drug treated group is 68, which is lower than the diastolic blood pressure in the placebo treated group (80). This suggests that the new drug may have a lowering effect on the diastolic blood pressure. 4. Tremors: Tremors are absent in the placebo treated group but present in the new drug treated group. This indicates that the new drug may cause tremors. Based on these observations, the new drug is likely to be an Alpha-1 antagonist and beta-2 agonist, as it increases heart rate, increases systolic blood pressure, lowers diastolic blood pressure, and causes tremors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Alpha-1 antagonist and beta-2 agonist\"}"
