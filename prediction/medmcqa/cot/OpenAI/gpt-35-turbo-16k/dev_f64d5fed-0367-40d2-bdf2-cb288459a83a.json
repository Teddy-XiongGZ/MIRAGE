    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The homunculus is a representation of the human body in the brain, specifically in the primary motor cortex. It is a distorted map where body parts that require more precise movements have larger representations. The maximum area in the homunculus signifies increased precisiveness of movements. This is because the larger the representation of a body part in the homunculus, the more cortical space is dedicated to controlling that body part, allowing for more precise movements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
