    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The heart sounds S1 and S2 are normal heart sounds and do not indicate stiffness of the ventricular wall. S1 is the first heart sound and is caused by the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves. S2 is the second heart sound and is caused by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. On the other hand, S3 and S4 are abnormal heart sounds that can indicate ventricular wall stiffness. S3 is a low-pitched sound heard in early diastole and is caused by rapid ventricular filling. S4 is a low-pitched sound heard in late diastole and is caused by atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle. Therefore, the correct answer is C. S3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
