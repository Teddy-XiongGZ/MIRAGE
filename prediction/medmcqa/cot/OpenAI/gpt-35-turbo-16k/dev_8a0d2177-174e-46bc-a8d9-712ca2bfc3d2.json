    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine periodontal disease, an epidemiological survey is done by assessing the condition of the gums and teeth. The gingival index (G.I.) measures the severity of gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums. The plaque index (P.I.) measures the amount of plaque on the teeth, which is a contributing factor to periodontal disease.
