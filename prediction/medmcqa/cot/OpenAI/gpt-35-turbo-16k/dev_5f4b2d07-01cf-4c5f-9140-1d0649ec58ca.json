    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phenylbutyrate is used in the management of urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is responsible for the detoxification of ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism. In urea cycle disorders, there is a deficiency or dysfunction of one of the enzymes involved in the urea cycle, leading to the accumulation of ammonia. Phenylbutyrate is a medication that helps in the management of urea cycle disorders by reducing the levels of ammonia in the body. It does this by acting as a nitrogen scavenger, converting ammonia into a less toxic form called phenylacetylglutamine. This compound can then be excreted in the urine, helping to remove excess nitrogen from the body. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Scavenges nitrogen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
