    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cardio inhibitory function is responsible for slowing down the heart rate. To determine which nucleus has this function, we need to consider the functions of each nucleus listed. \\n\\nA. Nucleus Ambiguus: This nucleus is involved in controlling the motor function of the vagus nerve, which innervates the heart. It does not have a direct cardio inhibitory function. \\n\\nB. Nucleus Tractus Solitarius: This nucleus receives sensory information from the baroreceptors and chemoreceptors in the cardiovascular system. It is involved in regulating blood pressure and heart rate, but it does not have a direct cardio inhibitory function. \\n\\nC. Rostral Ventrolateral Medulla: This nucleus is involved in regulating sympathetic outflow, which increases heart rate and blood pressure. It does not have a cardio inhibitory function. \\n\\nD. Dorsal motor nucleus of vagus: This nucleus is responsible for the parasympathetic innervation of the heart, which slows down the heart rate. It has a cardio inhibitory function. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is D. Dorsal motor nucleus of vagus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
