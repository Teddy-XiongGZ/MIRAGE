    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The eruption sequence of teeth follows a specific pattern. The mandibular incisors usually erupt before the mandibular molars, so option A is a normal and expected event. The mandibular canines usually erupt before the mandibular premolars, so option B is also a normal and expected event. The eruption of the mandibular 2nd premolar before the mandibular 2nd molar is not a common occurrence, but it can still happen in some cases. However, the eruption of the maxillary premolar and canine before the maxillary 2nd molar is not a normal sequence and is considered abnormal. Therefore, option D is the event that has little or no significance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
