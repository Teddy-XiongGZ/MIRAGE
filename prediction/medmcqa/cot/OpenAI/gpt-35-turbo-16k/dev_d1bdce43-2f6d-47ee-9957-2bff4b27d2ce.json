    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The correct sequential order of sperm formation is as follows: Spermatogonia (1) undergo mitosis to produce primary spermatocytes (2). Primary spermatocytes (2) then undergo meiosis I to produce secondary spermatocytes (3). Secondary spermatocytes (3) then undergo meiosis II to produce spermatids (4). Finally, spermatids (4) undergo spermiogenesis to differentiate into spermatozoa (5). Therefore, the correct sequential order is 1234.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
