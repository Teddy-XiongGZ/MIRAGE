    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times, we need to calculate the confidence interval. The formula for the confidence interval is: Lower limit = average - (Z * (SD / sqrt(n))), where Z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, SD is the standard deviation, and n is the sample size. In this case, the sample size is 100 and the desired confidence level is 95%. The z-score for a 95% confidence level is approximately 1.96. Plugging in the values, we get: Lower limit = 30 - (1.96 * (1 / sqrt(100))) = 30 - (1.96 * 0.1) = 30 - 0.196 = 29.804. Rounding down to the nearest whole number, the lower limit of the average that can be expected 95% of times is 29.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
