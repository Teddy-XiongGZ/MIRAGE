    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade, leading to both thrombosis and bleeding. In DIC, there is consumption of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in abnormal laboratory findings. To reveal bleeding in DIC, we need to look for markers of fibrinolysis, which is the breakdown of blood clots. The best laboratory investigation to reveal bleeding in DIC is the measurement of Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs). FDPs are small protein fragments that are released when blood clots are broken down. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased FDPs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
