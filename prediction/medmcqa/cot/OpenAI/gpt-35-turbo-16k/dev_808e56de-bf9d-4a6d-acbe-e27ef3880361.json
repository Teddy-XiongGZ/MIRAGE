    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infratemporal fossa is a space located deep to the zygomatic arch and lateral to the pterygoid plates. To determine the anterior limit of the infratemporal fossa, we need to consider the structures that border it anteriorly. A. The lateral pterygoid plate is a bony structure that forms part of the medial wall of the infratemporal fossa, so it is not the anterior limit. B. The maxillary posterior wall is not directly related to the infratemporal fossa, so it is not the anterior limit. C. The pterygomaxillary fissure is a narrow gap between the maxilla and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. It is located anteriorly to the infratemporal fossa and serves as the anterior limit. D. The mastoid process is a bony prominence located on the temporal bone, which is posterior to the infratemporal fossa. It is not the anterior limit. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Pterygomaxillary fissure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
