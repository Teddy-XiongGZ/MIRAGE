    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation of failure to thrive, polyuria, and medullary nephrocalcinosis suggests a renal disorder. The blood pH of 7.48 indicates alkalosis, which can be caused by a defect in renal acidification. The low potassium level (2 mEq/l) and low sodium level (126 mEq/l) suggest a renal tubular defect. The low chloride level (88 mEq/l) further supports a renal tubular disorder. Among the given options, the most likely diagnosis is Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (A) as it is characterized by failure to acidify urine, resulting in alkalosis and electrolyte abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
