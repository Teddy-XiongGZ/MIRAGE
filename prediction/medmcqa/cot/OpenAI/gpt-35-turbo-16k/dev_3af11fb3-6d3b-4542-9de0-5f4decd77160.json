    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In molecular biology, the 5'-3' direction refers to the orientation of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. In this direction, nucleotides are added or removed from the 3' end of the molecule. DNA repair involves the removal and replacement of damaged nucleotides, which can occur in either direction. DNA replication involves the synthesis of a new DNA strand, which occurs in the 5'-3' direction. RNA editing refers to the modification of RNA molecules, which can also occur in either direction. Transcription is the process of synthesizing RNA from a DNA template, and it occurs in the 5'-3' direction. Therefore, the correct answer is C. RNA editing does not occur in the 5'-3' direction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
