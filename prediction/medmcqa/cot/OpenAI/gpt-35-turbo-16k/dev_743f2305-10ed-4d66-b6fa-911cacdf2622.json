    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rh isoimmunisation occurs when a person with Rh-negative blood is exposed to Rh-positive blood, leading to the production of antibodies against the Rh antigen. The Rh antigen is present on the surface of red blood cells and is responsible for the positive or negative designation of blood type. In this case, we are looking for the type of Hb (hemoglobin) that is not affected by Rh isoimmunisation. Rh isoimmunisation specifically targets the Rh antigen, so the type of Hb that does not have the Rh antigen would not be affected. The Rh antigen is not present on the Hb molecule itself, but rather on the red blood cell membrane. Therefore, the type of Hb that is not affected by Rh isoimmunisation is not dependent on the presence or absence of the Rh antigen. Considering the given options, the type of Hb that is not affected by Rh isoimmunisation is not determined by any of the antibodies listed (Anti C, Anti E, Anti lewis, Anti D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Anti lewis\"}"
