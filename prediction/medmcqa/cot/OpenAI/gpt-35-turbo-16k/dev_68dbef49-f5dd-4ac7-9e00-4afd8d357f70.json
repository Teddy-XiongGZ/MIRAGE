    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the measure of location that divides the distribution in the ratio of 3:1, we need to consider the quartiles. The quartiles divide the distribution into four equal parts. The first quartile (Q1) represents the value below which 25% of the data falls, the median (Q2) represents the value below which 50% of the data falls, and the third quartile (Q3) represents the value below which 75% of the data falls. Since we want a ratio of 3:1, we need to find the quartile that represents the value below which 75% of the data falls. Therefore, the answer is C. Third quartile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
