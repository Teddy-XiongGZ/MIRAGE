    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aortic stenosis is a condition characterized by narrowing of the aortic valve, which obstructs the flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta. The physical signs of severe aortic stenosis include a delayed carotid upstroke and a systolic ejection murmur. A late peaking holosystolic murmur is typically associated with mitral regurgitation, not aortic stenosis. A diastolic rumble is commonly heard in mitral stenosis, not aortic stenosis. An opening snap is a characteristic finding in mitral stenosis, not aortic stenosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. A delayed carotid upstroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
