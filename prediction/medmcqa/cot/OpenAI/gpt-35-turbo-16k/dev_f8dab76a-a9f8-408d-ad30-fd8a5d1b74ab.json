    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The phenomenon described in the question is related to the appearance of a substance under different conditions of color. Mesomerism refers to the delocalization of electrons in a molecule, which does not directly relate to the appearance of color. Fluorescence refers to the emission of light by a substance after it has absorbed light of a different wavelength, which is not directly related to the appearance of color either. Refractive index refers to the measure of how light bends when passing through a substance, which is also not directly related to the appearance of color. Metamerism, on the other hand, refers to the phenomenon where two substances appear to have the same color under one set of conditions but appear different under another set of conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Metamerism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
