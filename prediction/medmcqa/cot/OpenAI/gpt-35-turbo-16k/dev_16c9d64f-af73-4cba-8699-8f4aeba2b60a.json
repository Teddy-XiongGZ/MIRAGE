    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The history of vomiting and malnutrition along with positive Guthrie test suggests a possible metabolic disorder. The presence of blue eyes, blonde hair, and fair skin indicates a lack of melanin production, which is commonly seen in phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This enzyme is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates in the body and can lead to various symptoms, including mental retardation. The Guthrie test is used to screen for PKU by measuring the levels of phenylalanine in the blood. Therefore, options A, C, and D are likely to be true for PKU. Option B, which suggests a white patch of hair due to tryptophan deficiency, is not associated with PKU. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
