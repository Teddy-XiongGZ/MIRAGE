    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the calcification stage of tooth development, disturbances can lead to various dental anomalies. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Peg laterals: This refers to the condition where the lateral incisors are smaller and have a conical shape. It is not directly related to disturbances during the calcification stage.\\n\\nB. Microdontia: This refers to the condition where the teeth are smaller than normal. While disturbances during calcification can potentially affect tooth size, microdontia can also be caused by other factors.\\n\\nC. Supernumerary tooth: This refers to the presence of extra teeth in the dental arch. It is not directly related to disturbances during the calcification stage.\\n\\nD. Interglobular dentin: This refers to the presence of globular defects in the dentin. It is a disturbance that can occur during the calcification stage of tooth development.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Interglobular dentin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
