    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Let's analyze each statement one by one.\\n\\nStatement A: Hepatitis B core antigen status is the most sensitive indicator of positive vertical transmission of disease. This statement is incorrect because the most sensitive indicator of positive vertical transmission of hepatitis B is the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the infant.\\n\\nStatement B: Hepatitis B is the most common form of hepatitis after blood transfusion. This statement is incorrect because hepatitis C is the most common form of hepatitis after blood transfusion.\\n\\nStatement C: The proper treatment of infants born to infected mothers includes the administration of hepatitis B immune globulin as well as vaccine. This statement is correct. Infants born to hepatitis B-infected mothers should receive both hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth to prevent vertical transmission.\\n\\nStatement D: Patients who develop chronic active hepatitis should undergo MTP. This statement is incorrect. MTP (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) is not the appropriate treatment for chronic active hepatitis. The treatment for chronic active hepatitis depends on the underlying cause and may include antiviral medications, immunosuppressive therapy, or liver transplantation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
