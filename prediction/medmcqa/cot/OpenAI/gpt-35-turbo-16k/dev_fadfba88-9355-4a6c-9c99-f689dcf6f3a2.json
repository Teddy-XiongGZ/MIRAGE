    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chronic periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gums and supporting structures of the teeth. In this condition, there is a breakdown of the periodontal tissues, including the gums, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone. The immune response plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes are important components of the immune system and are involved in the immune response against infections. Mast cells are also involved in the immune response and play a role in allergic reactions. Plasma cells are a type of B-lymphocyte that produce antibodies. In chronic periodontitis, there is an increased infiltration of immune cells, including B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, and plasma cells, in the periodontal tissues. These cells are recruited to the site of infection to help fight off the bacteria causing the inflammation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Plasma cells. In chronic periodontitis, there is an increased number of plasma cells in the periodontal tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
