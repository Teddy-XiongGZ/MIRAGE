    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best method to prevent cross infection in other patients in the same ward is to practice proper hand washing. Hand washing is a crucial and effective measure in preventing the spread of infections. It helps to remove microorganisms from the hands and reduce the risk of transmission.
