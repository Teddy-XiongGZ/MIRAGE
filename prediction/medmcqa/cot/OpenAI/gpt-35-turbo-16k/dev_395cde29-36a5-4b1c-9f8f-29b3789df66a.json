    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the force generated by the 90\u00b0 rotation of the finger spring in the pendulum appliance with distalisation, we need to consider the properties of the spring and the angle of rotation. The force generated by a spring is directly proportional to the angle of rotation. Assuming that the force generated by the spring is linearly proportional to the angle of rotation, we can use the formula: Force = k * \u03b8 Where: - Force is the force generated by the spring - k is the spring constant - \u03b8 is the angle of rotation Since the question does not provide the spring constant or any other specific information, we cannot calculate the exact force. Therefore, we cannot determine the answer choice from the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
