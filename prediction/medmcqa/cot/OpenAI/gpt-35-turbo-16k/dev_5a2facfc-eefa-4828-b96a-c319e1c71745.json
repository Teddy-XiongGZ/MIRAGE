    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus. It is commonly found in areas where sheep and dogs are raised. The adult tapeworm resides in the intestines of dogs, and the eggs are passed in the feces. When humans come into contact with contaminated soil, water, or food, they can ingest the eggs and become infected. The eggs hatch in the intestines and the larvae migrate to various organs, most commonly the liver and lungs, where they form cysts. These cysts can grow and cause symptoms depending on their size and location. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Parasitic in nature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
