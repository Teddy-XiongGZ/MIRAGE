    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the patient presented with acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. Salbutamol inhalation didn't improve the condition, but the addition of intravenous coicosteroids and aminophylline improved the patient's condition. To determine the mechanism of action of coicosteroids in this condition, we need to consider their known effects. Coicosteroids are known to have anti-inflammatory properties and can reduce airway inflammation in asthma. They work by suppressing the immune response and reducing the production of inflammatory mediators. This can help to relieve bronchial constriction and improve symptoms. Given this information, we can eliminate options A, B, and D as they do not align with the known mechanism of action of coicosteroids. Option C, which suggests that coicosteroids increase the action of aminophylline on adenosine receptors, is also not correct. Therefore, the correct answer is D. They increase the mucociliary clearance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
