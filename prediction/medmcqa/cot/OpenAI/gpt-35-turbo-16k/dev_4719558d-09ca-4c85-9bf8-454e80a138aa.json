However, in general, stage-I cancer larynx is often treated with a single modality approach rather than a combination of treatments. Radical surgery, which involves the complete removal of the tumor, is typically reserved for more advanced stages of laryngeal cancer. Chemotherapy is usually used in combination with other treatments for more advanced stages as well.
