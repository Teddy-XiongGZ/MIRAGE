    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelinated nerve fibers have a myelin sheath, which is a fatty substance that wraps around the axon. This myelin sheath acts as an insulator and helps to increase the speed of nerve impulse conduction. Now let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers: This statement is incorrect. Myelinated fibers conduct impulses faster than non-myelinated fibers due to saltatory conduction.\\n\\nB. Membrane currents are generated at nodes of Ranvier: This statement is correct. Nodes of Ranvier are the gaps in the myelin sheath where the axon is exposed, and it is at these nodes that membrane currents are generated.\\n\\nC. Saltatory conduction of impulses is seen: This statement is correct. Saltatory conduction is the rapid jumping of the nerve impulse from one node of Ranvier to the next, which occurs in myelinated fibers.\\n\\nD. Local anesthesia is effective only when the nerve is not covered by myelin sheath: This statement is incorrect. Local anesthesia can still be effective even when the nerve is covered by a myelin sheath. It blocks the generation and conduction of nerve impulses regardless of whether the nerve is myelinated or not.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is A. Impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
