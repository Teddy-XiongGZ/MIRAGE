    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontosis is a condition that affects the supporting structures of the teeth, including the gums, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone. It is characterized by inflammation and destruction of these tissues. To determine which teeth are mainly affected by periodontosis, we need to consider the distribution of the supporting structures. The molars, premolars, and incisors all have supporting structures, so we need to determine which teeth are most commonly affected. Molars are located at the back of the mouth and have multiple roots, making them more susceptible to periodontosis. Upper incisors are the front teeth in the upper jaw, and premolars are located between the canines and molars. Based on the distribution of supporting structures and the likelihood of periodontosis, the most likely answer is C. Molars and incisors. These teeth are commonly affected by periodontosis due to their location and the presence of multiple roots in molars.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
