    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a permanent tooth has a fracture involving the apical one-third of the root, it is likely to have damage to the pulp and surrounding tissues. This can lead to various outcomes. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Exhibit internal root resorption: Internal root resorption is a pathological process where the tooth's own tissues resorb from the inside. While it can occur in response to trauma, it is not the most likely outcome in this case.\\n\\nB. Remain vital and functional: It is unlikely for the tooth to remain vital and functional after such a fracture, as the damage to the pulp and surrounding tissues would compromise its health.\\n\\nC. Be ankylosed: Ankylosis is a condition where the tooth fuses to the surrounding bone, usually due to trauma. While it is possible for ankylosis to occur in this case, it is not the most likely outcome.\\n\\nD. Exhibit external root resorption and exfoliate: External root resorption is a pathological process where the tooth's root is resorbed from the outside. Given the extent of the fracture and damage to the tooth, this is the most likely outcome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
