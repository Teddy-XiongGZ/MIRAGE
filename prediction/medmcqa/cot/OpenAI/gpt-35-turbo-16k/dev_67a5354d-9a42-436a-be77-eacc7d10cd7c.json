    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To differentiate between an enamel hatchet and a chisel, we need to consider the characteristics of each tool. Let's go through each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Curved in one plane only: Both enamel hatchet and chisel can have a curved blade, so this is not a distinguishing factor.\\n\\nB. Blade is larger: This could be a distinguishing factor as enamel hatchets typically have a smaller blade compared to chisels.\\n\\nC. Blade is perpendicular to the long axis of handle: This is a characteristic of a chisel, not an enamel hatchet.\\n\\nD. Blade is heavier: Both enamel hatchets and chisels can have heavy blades, so this is not a distinguishing factor.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. Blade is larger.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
