    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p-value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A p-value less than 0.10 indicates that there is a 10% chance of observing the results (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, the correct interpretation of a p-value less than 0.10 is that there is evidence to suggest that the drug is effective in chronic hypertensives, but there is still a possibility that the results could have occurred by chance. So, the correct answer is B. 90% of test results could have occurred by chance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
