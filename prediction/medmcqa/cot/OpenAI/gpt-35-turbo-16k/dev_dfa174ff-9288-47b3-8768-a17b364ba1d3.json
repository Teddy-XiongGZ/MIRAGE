    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). COX is responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in inflammation, pain, and platelet aggregation. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX, meaning that its effects last for the lifespan of the platelet (7-10 days). This leads to a decrease in the production of thromboxane TXA2, which promotes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Additionally, aspirin also inhibits the production of prostaglandin PGI2, which promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Inhibition of prostaglandin PGI2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
