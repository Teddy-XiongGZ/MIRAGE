    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a relaxed state, the chest wall and lung recoil are balanced at the functional residual capacity (FRC). FRC is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal expiration. It represents the equilibrium point where the elastic recoil of the lungs is balanced by the outward recoil of the chest wall. Minute volume refers to the total volume of air moved in and out of the lungs per minute, and it does not represent the balance between chest wall and lung recoil. Total lung capacity (TLC) is the maximum volume of air the lungs can hold, and residual volume is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal expiration. Neither TLC nor residual volume represent the balance between chest wall and lung recoil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. FRC\"}"
