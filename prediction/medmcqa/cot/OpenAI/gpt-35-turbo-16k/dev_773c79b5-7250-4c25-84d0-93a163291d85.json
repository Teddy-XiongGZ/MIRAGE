    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The position and movement of the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is controlled by various structures. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Lower head of lateral pterygoid muscle: The lower head of the lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for depressing the mandible and assisting in protrusion. It does not directly control the position and movement of the articular disc.\\n\\nB. Sphenomandibular ligament: The sphenomandibular ligament is a passive structure that helps stabilize the mandible. It does not control the position and movement of the articular disc.\\n\\nC. Superficial head of medial pterygoid muscle: The superficial head of the medial pterygoid muscle is involved in elevating the mandible and assisting in protrusion. It does not directly control the position and movement of the articular disc.\\n\\nD. Upper head of lateral pterygoid muscle: The upper head of the lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for pulling the articular disc forward during jaw opening and controlling its position and movement. It plays a crucial role in the function of the TMJ.\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is D. Upper head of lateral pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
