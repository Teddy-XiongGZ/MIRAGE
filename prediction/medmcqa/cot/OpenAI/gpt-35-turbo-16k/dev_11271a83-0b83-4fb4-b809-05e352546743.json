    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To select patients with respect to potential factors that will affect the results, we need a sampling method that takes into account these factors. Systematic random sampling involves selecting every nth patient from a list, without considering any specific factors. Simple random sampling involves randomly selecting patients from a list, without considering any specific factors. Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and randomly selecting entire clusters, which may not take into account specific factors. Stratified random sampling, on the other hand, involves dividing the population into subgroups based on specific factors and then randomly selecting patients from each subgroup. This method allows for the selection of patients with respect to potential factors that will affect the results. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Stratified random sampling.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
