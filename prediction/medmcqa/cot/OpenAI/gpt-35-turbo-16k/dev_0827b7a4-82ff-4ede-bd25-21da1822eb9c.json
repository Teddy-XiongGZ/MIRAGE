    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Skeletal muscles contract when the actin and myosin filaments slide past each other. This sliding filament theory is the basis for muscle contraction. Step 2: Calcium plays a crucial role in muscle contraction by binding to troponin, which causes a conformational change in tropomyosin. Step 3: The conformational change in tropomyosin exposes the binding sites on actin, allowing myosin heads to bind and form cross-bridges. Step 4: The myosin heads then undergo a power stroke, pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere and shortening the muscle. Step 5: Finally, the myosin heads detach from actin, and the process can repeat if there is sufficient calcium and ATP available. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Contraction is initiated by calcium binding to troponin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
