    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Continued use of a vibrator can lead to various effects on the skin and underlying tissues. The vibrations from the device can cause mechanical trauma to the skin, leading to changes in its appearance and texture. This trauma can result in the formation of nodules, which are small, raised bumps on the skin. Additionally, the constant friction and pressure from the vibrator can cause surface roughness and irregularities. Discoloration may also occur due to the disruption of blood flow in the affected area. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Random nodule formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
