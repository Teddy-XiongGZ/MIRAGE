    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The extra-embryonic mesoderm is a layer of cells that forms outside the embryo during early development. To determine its origin, we need to consider the different layers of cells in the embryo. The epiblast and hypoblast are the two primary layers of cells in the early embryo. The primary yolk sac is formed from the hypoblast, while the secondary yolk sac is formed from the endoderm. Therefore, the extra-embryonic mesoderm is not derived from the epiblast, primary yolk sac, or secondary yolk sac. This leaves us with the option D, hypoblast, as the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
