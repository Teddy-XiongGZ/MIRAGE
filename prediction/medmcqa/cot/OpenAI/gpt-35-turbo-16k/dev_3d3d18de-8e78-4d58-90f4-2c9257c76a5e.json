    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which fracture results in the given deformity, we need to analyze the deformity and compare it with the characteristics of each fracture option. A. Supracondylar fracture of humerus: This fracture typically results in posterior displacement of the distal fragment, causing a 'gunstock' deformity with the forearm in extension and the elbow in flexion. B. Lateral condylar fracture: This fracture usually results in a 'planovalgus' deformity, with the elbow deviated laterally and the forearm deviated medially. C. Olecranon fracture: This fracture can result in an 'extensor lag' deformity, where the patient is unable to fully extend the elbow. D. Radial head fracture: This fracture may result in a 'nursemaid's elbow' deformity, where the patient is unable to fully supinate the forearm. Based on the given deformity, the most likely fracture is the Supracondylar fracture of humerus (Option A), which causes a 'gunstock' deformity with the forearm in extension and the elbow in flexion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
