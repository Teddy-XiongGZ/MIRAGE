    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, the cardiovascular system undergoes significant changes to accommodate the growing fetus. These changes can put additional strain on the heart, especially in patients with pre-existing heart conditions. To determine the worst prognosis during pregnancy in a heart patient, we need to consider the impact of pregnancy on each of the given conditions. A. Mitral regurgitation: Mitral regurgitation is the backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium due to a leaky mitral valve. During pregnancy, the increased blood volume and heart rate can exacerbate the regurgitation. However, with appropriate management, the prognosis can be relatively good. B. Mitral valve prolapse: Mitral valve prolapse is a condition where the mitral valve bulges back into the left atrium during systole. Pregnancy does not typically worsen mitral valve prolapse, and the prognosis is generally favorable. C. Aortic stenosis: Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve, which obstructs blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. Pregnancy increases the blood volume and cardiac output, which can worsen the obstruction and lead to heart failure. Therefore, aortic stenosis has a worse prognosis during pregnancy compared to the other conditions. D. Pulmonary stenosis: Pulmonary stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, which obstructs blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. Pregnancy does not typically worsen pulmonary stenosis, and the prognosis is generally favorable. Based on the above considerations, the worst prognosis during pregnancy is seen in C. Aortic stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
