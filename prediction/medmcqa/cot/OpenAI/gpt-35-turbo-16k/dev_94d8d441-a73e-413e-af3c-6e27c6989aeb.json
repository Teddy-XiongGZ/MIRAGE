    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endodermal cells are derived from the endoderm germ layer during embryonic development. The endoderm gives rise to various organs and tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and respiratory system. To determine which cells are of endodermal origin, we need to consider the embryonic origin of each cell type listed. \\n\\nA. Epithelial cells of the intestine: The intestine is derived from the endoderm, so the epithelial cells of the intestine are of endodermal origin. \\n\\nB. Odontoblasts: Odontoblasts are cells that form dentin in teeth. Dentin is derived from the mesoderm, not the endoderm. Therefore, odontoblasts are not of endodermal origin. \\n\\nC. Goblet cells: Goblet cells are specialized epithelial cells found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. They are derived from the endoderm, so goblet cells are of endodermal origin. \\n\\nD. Hepatocytes: Hepatocytes are the main functional cells of the liver. The liver is derived from the endoderm, so hepatocytes are of endodermal origin. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the cell type that is not of endodermal origin is B. Odontoblasts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
