    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mandibular incisors typically have one root canal. However, in some cases, they can have two root canals. To determine the percentage of Mandibular incisors with two root canals, we need to consider the prevalence of this anatomical variation. Based on available data, the percentage of Mandibular incisors with two root canals is relatively low. Let's analyze the given options: \\n\\nA. 22-40%: This range seems too high for the prevalence of two root canals in Mandibular incisors. \\nB. 11-22%: This range is more plausible, but we need to consider other options as well. \\nC. 20-50%: This range is also quite high and unlikely to be accurate. \\nD. 5-15%: This range seems more reasonable and aligns with the available data. \\n\\nConsidering the information provided, the most appropriate answer choice is D. 5-15%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
