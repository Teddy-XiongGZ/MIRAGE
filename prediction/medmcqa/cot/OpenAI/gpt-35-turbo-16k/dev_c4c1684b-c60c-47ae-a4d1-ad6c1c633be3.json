    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key ridge useful in assessing malocclusion refers to the area of the jaw where the teeth come together. Malocclusion is a misalignment of the teeth and jaw. To determine which bone the key ridge is present on, we need to consider the anatomy of the jaw. The maxilla is the upper jaw bone, and it forms the majority of the hard palate and the upper dental arch. The zygomatic buttress is a bony prominence on the side of the face that supports the cheekbone. The sphenoid bone is located deep within the skull and is not directly involved in the formation of the jaw. The mandible is the lower jaw bone, and it is responsible for the movement of the lower teeth. Considering the function and location of the key ridge, it is most likely present on the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Mandible\"}"
