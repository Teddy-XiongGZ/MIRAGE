    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best way to prevent infection to the child in this scenario is to provide both the full course of Hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin to the child. Here's why: 1. Option A, providing only the Hepatitis vaccine to the child, may not be sufficient to prevent infection as the child is already at risk due to the mother being HBs Ag positive. 2. Option C, providing Hepatitis B immunoglobulin to the mother, may help reduce the risk of transmission to the child, but it is not the most effective method on its own. 3. Option D, providing Hepatitis B immunization to the mother, is important for the long-term health of the mother, but it does not directly prevent transmission to the child. 4. Option B, providing both the full course of Hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin to the child, is the best approach as it provides both active and passive immunity to the child, reducing the risk of transmission.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
