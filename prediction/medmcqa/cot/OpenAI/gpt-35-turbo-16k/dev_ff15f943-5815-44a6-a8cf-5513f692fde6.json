    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with abdominal pain and funneling of the internal os on ultrasound. This suggests the possibility of cervical insufficiency, which is a condition where the cervix begins to dilate prematurely. Given the gestational age of 22 weeks, the ideal management would be to consider cervical cerclage. Cervical cerclage is a surgical procedure in which a stitch is placed around the cervix to reinforce it and prevent further dilation. The two common types of cervical cerclage are Fothergill's stitch and Mc Donald's stitch. Dinoprost and Misoprost are medications used for medical abortion and would not be appropriate in this case. Therefore, the ideal management in this scenario would be either Fothergill's stitch or Mc Donald's stitch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C/D\"}"
