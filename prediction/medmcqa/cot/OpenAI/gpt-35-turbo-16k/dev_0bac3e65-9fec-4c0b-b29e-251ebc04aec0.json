    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A temporary bridge constructed from a synthetic resin is used to replace a missing tooth temporarily until a permanent bridge or restoration can be placed. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Is not required when the missing tooth is provided on a partial denture: This statement is incorrect because a temporary bridge is still needed even if the missing tooth is provided on a partial denture.\\n\\nB. Should be cemented with a polycarboxylate cement to ensure retention between the preparation and fitting stages: This statement is incorrect because a temporary bridge is usually cemented with a temporary cement, not a polycarboxylate cement.\\n\\nC. Should have the same buccal and lingual contours as the permanent bridge: This statement is correct. The temporary bridge should have similar contours to the permanent bridge to provide proper esthetics and function.\\n\\nD. Should restore the occlusion to the same extent as the permanent bridge: This statement is incorrect because a temporary bridge is not intended to fully restore the occlusion like a permanent bridge.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the correct answer is C. Should have the same buccal and lingual contours as the permanent bridge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
