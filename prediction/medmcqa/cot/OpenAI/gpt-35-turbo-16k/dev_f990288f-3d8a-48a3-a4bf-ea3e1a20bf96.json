    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The adrenal glands are responsible for secreting various hormones. To determine the exclusive source of secretion in females, we need to consider the hormones produced by the adrenal glands and their role in female physiology. A. Estrogen: While the adrenal glands do produce a small amount of estrogen, the primary source of estrogen in females is the ovaries. B. Testosterone: The adrenal glands do produce a small amount of testosterone, but the ovaries are the primary source of testosterone in females. C. DHEAS (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate): DHEAS is a precursor hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It is converted into other hormones, including estrogen and testosterone, in peripheral tissues. However, it is not the exclusive source of secretion in females. D. Progesterone: Progesterone is primarily produced by the ovaries in females, particularly during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Based on the above information, the correct answer is D. Progesterone, as the adrenal glands are not the exclusive source for its secretion in females.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
