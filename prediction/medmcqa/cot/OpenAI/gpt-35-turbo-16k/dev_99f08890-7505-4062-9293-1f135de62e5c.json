    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient is a 16-year-old male with nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis. The CT scan shows an enhancing mass in the nasopharynx with minimal extension into the sphenoid sinus and no lateral extension. This information suggests a nasopharyngeal mass. To determine the stage of this lesion, we need to refer to the staging system for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The most commonly used staging system is the TNM system, which stands for Tumor, Node, and Metastasis. In this case, the T stage refers to the size and extent of the primary tumor. According to the TNM staging system, a nasopharyngeal mass with minimal extension into the sphenoid sinus and no lateral extension would be classified as T1. The stage of the lesion can then be determined by combining the T stage with the N (lymph node involvement) and M (metastasis) stages. However, since the question only provides information about the T stage, we can conclude that the stage of this lesion is IA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
