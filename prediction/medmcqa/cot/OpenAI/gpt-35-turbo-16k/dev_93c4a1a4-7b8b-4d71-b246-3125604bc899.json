    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The movement of the condyle in the glenoid fossa is primarily responsible for the opening and closing of the jaw. To determine which muscle causes the forward movement of the condyle, we need to consider the muscles involved in jaw movement. The masseter muscle is responsible for elevating the jaw, not for the forward movement of the condyle. The temporalis muscle is also involved in elevating the jaw and does not directly cause the forward movement of the condyle. The medial pterygoid muscle is responsible for the lateral movement of the jaw, not the forward movement of the condyle. The lateral pterygoid muscle, on the other hand, is responsible for the forward movement of the condyle in the glenoid fossa. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Lateral pterygoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
