    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Consistent radiographs require several factors to be considered. The long cone technique is used to minimize distortion and produce consistent images. Fixed kvp (kilovoltage peak) and mA (milliamperage) settings ensure consistent exposure and image quality. Automatic processing helps to ensure consistent development of the radiographs. Proper developing techniques, such as maintaining the correct temperature and timing, also contribute to consistent results. Considering these factors, the answer choice that encompasses all of these requirements is D. Proper developing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
