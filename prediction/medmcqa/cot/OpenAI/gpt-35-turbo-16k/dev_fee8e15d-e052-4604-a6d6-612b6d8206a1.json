    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Guthrie test is a screening test for phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting the amino acid phenylalanine into another amino acid called tyrosine. In PKU, there is a defect in the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme, leading to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood. This can cause various symptoms, including vomiting and malnutrition. The Guthrie test detects elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood. Therefore, option A is true. Option B is not true because a white patch of hair is not a characteristic feature of PKU. Option C is true because the accumulation of phenylalanine in PKU can lead to the production of phenylacetate, which can be detected in the urine. Option D is true because if PKU is left untreated, it can lead to mental retardation. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
