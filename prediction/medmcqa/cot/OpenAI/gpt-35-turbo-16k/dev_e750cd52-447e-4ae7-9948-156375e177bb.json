    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To check for viability of myocardium, we need a noninvasive investigation that can assess the blood flow and function of the heart muscle. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. FDG-18 PET CT: This is a nuclear imaging technique that uses a radioactive tracer to assess glucose metabolism in the heart. While it can provide information about myocardial viability, it is not the best choice as it primarily evaluates metabolism rather than blood flow or function.\\n\\nB. MIBG scintigraphy: This is a nuclear imaging technique that uses a radioactive tracer to assess sympathetic innervation of the heart. It is not the best choice for evaluating myocardial viability as it primarily assesses nerve function rather than blood flow or function.\\n\\nC. Echocardiogram: This is a noninvasive imaging technique that uses ultrasound waves to assess the structure and function of the heart. It can provide information about myocardial viability by evaluating wall motion abnormalities and assessing blood flow. Echocardiogram is commonly used for this purpose and is considered the best noninvasive investigation for checking myocardial viability.\\n\\nD. Thallium scintigraphy: This is a nuclear imaging technique that uses a radioactive tracer to assess blood flow to the heart muscle. It can provide information about myocardial viability by evaluating perfusion. While it is a good option, echocardiogram is generally preferred as it provides additional information about wall motion abnormalities.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the best noninvasive investigation to check for viability of myocardium is an echocardiogram.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
