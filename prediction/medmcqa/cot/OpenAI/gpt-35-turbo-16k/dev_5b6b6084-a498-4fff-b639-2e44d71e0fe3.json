    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute bacterial meningitis is a serious infection of the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The most common pathogens causing acute bacterial meningitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The drug of choice for treating acute bacterial meningitis depends on the causative organism and its susceptibility to antibiotics. Erythromycin is not the drug of choice for acute bacterial meningitis. Sulfisoxazole is not commonly used for treating acute bacterial meningitis. Cefoperazone is not typically used as the first-line treatment for acute bacterial meningitis. Ceftriaxone, on the other hand, is a third-generation cephalosporin that has excellent activity against the common pathogens causing acute bacterial meningitis. It penetrates well into the cerebrospinal fluid and has a broad spectrum of activity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Ceftriaxone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
