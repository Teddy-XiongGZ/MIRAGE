    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a functional implant, bone loss is expected to occur due to the lack of natural stimulation from the tooth root. However, the amount of bone loss can vary depending on various factors. After 1 year, it is generally expected to see some bone loss in a functional implant. Option A: 1.5 to 2 mm - This is a possible range of bone loss, but it may be on the higher side. Option B: Less than 0.1 mm - This seems unlikely as bone loss is expected to occur in a functional implant. Option C: 1 to 2 mm - This is a possible range of bone loss, but it may be on the higher side. Option D: 1 to 1.5 mm - This is a possible range of bone loss and seems to be a reasonable estimate. Considering the options, the most reasonable answer would be D. 1 to 1.5 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
