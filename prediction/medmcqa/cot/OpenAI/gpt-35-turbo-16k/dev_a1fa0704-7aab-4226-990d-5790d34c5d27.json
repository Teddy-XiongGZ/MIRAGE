    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"T cells are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the immune response. They are responsible for recognizing and attacking foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. T cells express specific proteins on their surface, known as cluster of differentiation (CD) markers, which help to identify and classify them. CD4 and CD8 are two important CD markers found on T cells. CD4 is associated with helper T cells, which coordinate the immune response and activate other immune cells. CD8 is associated with cytotoxic T cells, which directly kill infected or cancerous cells. Therefore, the correct answer is C. CD8.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
