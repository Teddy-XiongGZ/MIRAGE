    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"T-lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that play a crucial role in the immune response. They are responsible for cell-mediated immunity, which involves the activation of other immune cells and the destruction of infected or abnormal cells. T-lymphocytes do not directly produce antibodies, so option A can be ruled out. Lymphokines are chemical messengers produced by T-lymphocytes that help regulate the immune response, and delayed hypersensitivity is a type of immune response mediated by T-lymphocytes. Therefore, option B is a possible answer. T-lymphocytes do not directly activate the complement system, so option C can be ruled out. Immediate hypersensitivity is an allergic reaction mediated by antibodies, not T-lymphocytes, so option D can be ruled out as well.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
