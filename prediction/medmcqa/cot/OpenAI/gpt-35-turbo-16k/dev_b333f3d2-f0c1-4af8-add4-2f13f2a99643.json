    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best radiographic view of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), we need to consider the anatomy and purpose of each view. \\n\\nA. Transorbital view: This view is used to assess the orbits and is not specific to the TMJ. \\n\\nB. Reverse Towne's view: This view is used to visualize the occipital bone and is not specific to the TMJ. \\n\\nC. Transpharyngeal view: This view involves inserting a radiopaque contrast medium into the pharynx to visualize the TMJ. It is an invasive procedure and not commonly used. \\n\\nD. Panorex: This view is a panoramic radiograph that captures the entire dentition, including the TMJ. It provides a good overview of the TMJ and is commonly used in dental practice. \\n\\nBased on the options provided, the best radiographic view of the temporomandibular joint is D. Panorex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
