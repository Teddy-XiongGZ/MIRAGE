    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament is a specialized connective tissue that surrounds and attaches teeth to the alveolar bone. It contains blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to the ligament and the surrounding tissues. To determine the vascular supply of the periodontal ligament, we need to consider the location and distribution of blood vessels within the ligament. Option A states that the greatest vascular supply is in the middle-third of a single rooted tooth. This is not accurate because the blood vessels in the periodontal ligament are distributed throughout its entire length, not limited to a specific third. Option B suggests that the greatest vascular supply is in the middle-third of a multirooted tooth. This is also incorrect because, similar to option A, the blood vessels are distributed throughout the entire length of the periodontal ligament, regardless of the tooth's root structure. Option C states that the vascular supply forms a net-like plexus that runs closer to the cementum than to the bone. This is not accurate because the blood vessels in the periodontal ligament are located closer to the bone than to the cementum. The blood vessels enter the ligament from the bone side and then branch out to supply the ligament and surrounding tissues. Option D suggests that the vascular supply forms a net-like plexus that runs closer to the bone than to the cementum. This is the correct answer. The blood vessels in the periodontal ligament run closer to the bone, entering from the bone side and forming a network within the ligament. This arrangement allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the blood vessels and the cells of the ligament. Therefore, the correct answer is D. A net-like plexus that runs closer to the bone than to the cementum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
