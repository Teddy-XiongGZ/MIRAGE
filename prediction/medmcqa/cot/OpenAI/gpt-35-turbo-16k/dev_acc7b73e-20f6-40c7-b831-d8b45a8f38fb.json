    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the poor prognostic indicator of ALL, we need to consider the factors that are associated with a worse outcome in patients with this condition. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Female sex: Gender is not typically considered a poor prognostic indicator in ALL.\\n\\nB. Leukocyte count < 50,000: A higher leukocyte count is generally associated with a poorer prognosis in ALL, so a leukocyte count < 50,000 would not be a poor prognostic indicator.\\n\\nC. Age greater than 1 year: ALL is more common in children, and age greater than 1 year is not typically considered a poor prognostic indicator.\\n\\nD. Hypodiploidy: Hypodiploidy, which refers to a chromosome number less than the normal diploid number, is associated with a worse prognosis in ALL. Therefore, hypodiploidy is a poor prognostic indicator of ALL.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Hypodiploidy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
