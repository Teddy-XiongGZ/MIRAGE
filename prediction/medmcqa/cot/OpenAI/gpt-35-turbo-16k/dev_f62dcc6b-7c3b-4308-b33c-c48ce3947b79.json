    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adrenal suppression refers to the suppression of the adrenal glands, which are responsible for producing hormones such as cortisol. To determine which anaesthetic agent causes adrenal suppression, we need to consider the effects of each option on the adrenal glands. A. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine sedative that does not directly affect the adrenal glands. It is unlikely to cause adrenal suppression. B. Thiopentone is a barbiturate anaesthetic that can suppress the adrenal glands. It inhibits the release of cortisol and can lead to adrenal suppression. C. Etomidate is an intravenous anaesthetic that also suppresses the adrenal glands. It inhibits the production of cortisol and can cause adrenal suppression. D. Propofol is a short-acting intravenous anaesthetic that does not directly affect the adrenal glands. It is unlikely to cause adrenal suppression. Based on this information, the anaesthetic agents that can cause adrenal suppression are Thiopentone (B) and Etomidate (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/C\"}"
