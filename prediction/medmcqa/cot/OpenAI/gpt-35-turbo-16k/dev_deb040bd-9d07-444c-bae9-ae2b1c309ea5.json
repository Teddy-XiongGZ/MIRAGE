    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of fatigue, tingling sensation in both hands and legs, fissured red tongue, lesions at the angle of the mouth, and peripheral neuropathy suggests a possible vitamin deficiency. Decreased RBC glutathione reductase activity is a characteristic finding in a specific vitamin deficiency. Riboflavin deficiency can cause similar symptoms, but it does not typically present with lesions at the angle of the mouth. Thiamine deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, but it does not typically present with a fissured red tongue. Vitamin B6 deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, but it does not typically present with lesions at the angle of the mouth. Vitamin B12 deficiency, on the other hand, can cause all of the mentioned symptoms, including fatigue, tingling sensation, fissured red tongue, lesions at the angle of the mouth, and peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the likely deficient vitamin in this case is Vitamin B12.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Vitamin B12\"}"
