    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The submandibular gland is innervated by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve. Therefore, during the excision of the submandibular gland, special care should be taken to avoid the mandibular branch of the facial nerve, which supplies the muscles of mastication. The ansa cervicalis is not directly related to the submandibular gland and is responsible for innervating the infrahyoid muscles. The posterior auricular nerve is not involved in the innervation of the submandibular gland. The submandibular ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion located near the submandibular gland, but it is not directly related to the excision of the gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
