    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The diagnosis of primary herpes simplex is typically made by laboratory testing. One common method is to perform a culture of the lesion and then stain the cells to identify the presence of the herpes simplex virus. Giemsa stain and Wright stain are commonly used stains in microbiology, but they are not specific for herpes simplex virus. Routine cytology is a general term for the examination of cells under a microscope, but it is not specific for herpes simplex virus either.
