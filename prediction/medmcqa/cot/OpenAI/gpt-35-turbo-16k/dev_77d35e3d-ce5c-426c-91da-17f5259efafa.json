    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best investigation to diagnose the pathology in a 2-year-old premature neonate with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) would be an MRI brain. Transcranial ultrasound is commonly used in neonates to evaluate the brain, but it may not provide enough detail to diagnose the underlying pathology causing the seizures. CT head can provide good imaging of the brain, but it involves radiation exposure, which is a concern in young children. X-ray is not typically used to evaluate the brain. Therefore, MRI brain is the most appropriate investigation choice in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. MRI brain\"}"
