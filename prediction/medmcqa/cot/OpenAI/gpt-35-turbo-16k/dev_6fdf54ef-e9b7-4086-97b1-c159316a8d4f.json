    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Naive T cells are activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that present antigens to them. The main APCs involved in T cell activation are dendritic cells. Dendritic cells capture antigens, process them, and present them on their surface using major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This interaction between the antigen-presenting dendritic cell and the naive T cell leads to T cell activation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
