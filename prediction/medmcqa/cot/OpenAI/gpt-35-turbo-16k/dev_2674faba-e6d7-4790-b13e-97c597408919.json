    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common mediastinal tumor, we need to consider the prevalence of different types of tumors in the mediastinum. The mediastinum is divided into three compartments: anterior, middle, and posterior. The most common mediastinal tumor overall is the thymoma, which is typically found in the anterior mediastinum. Neurogenic tumors, such as neurofibromas and ganglioneuromas, are also relatively common in the posterior mediastinum. Lymphomas can occur in any compartment of the mediastinum and are a common tumor type as well. Bronchogenic cysts are less common than the other options and are typically found in the middle mediastinum. Considering the overall prevalence, the most common mediastinal tumor is the thymoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Thymoma\"}"
