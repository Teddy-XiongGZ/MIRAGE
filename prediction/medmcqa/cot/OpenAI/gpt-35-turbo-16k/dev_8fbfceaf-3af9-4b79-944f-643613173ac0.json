    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infants born to mothers with I.D.D.M (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) are at risk for long-term complications due to exposure to high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. DM (Diabetes Mellitus): Infants born to I.D.D.M mothers have an increased risk of developing diabetes later in life, so this is a possible long-term complication.\\n\\nB. Ketotic hypoglycemia: Ketotic hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by low blood sugar levels and the production of ketones. While infants born to I.D.D.M mothers may experience hypoglycemia, ketotic hypoglycemia is not a specific long-term complication.\\n\\nC. Obesity: Infants born to I.D.D.M mothers may have an increased risk of developing obesity, but it is not a direct long-term complication.\\n\\nD. Blindness: Infants born to I.D.D.M mothers are at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to blindness. Therefore, blindness is a possible long-term complication.\\n\\nConsidering the options, the correct answer is D. Blindness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
