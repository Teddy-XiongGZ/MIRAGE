    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In response to traumatic occlusal forces, the alveolar bone undergoes remodeling. This remodeling process involves the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation, while osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption. When there are areas of tension, osteoblasts are stimulated to deposit new bone, resulting in bone formation. On the other hand, in areas of pressure, osteoclasts are stimulated to resorb bone, resulting in bone resorption. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Osteoblasts in areas of tension and osteoclasts in areas of pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
