    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Moyer's classification of class II type D malocclusion, the term 'class II' refers to a dental malocclusion where the upper teeth (maxilla) are positioned further forward than the lower teeth (mandible). The term 'type D' indicates that the malocclusion is characterized by a retruded or retrognathic mandible. Now, we need to determine the position of the maxilla. The options A, B, C, and D describe different combinations of maxillary and mandibular positions. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider that in class II type D malocclusion, the maxilla is usually in a normal or orthognathic position. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Orthognathic maxilla and retrognathic mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
