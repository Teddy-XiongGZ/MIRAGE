    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's go through each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Before performing the ABG, syringe should be loaded with 0.3 cc of heparin - This is true. Heparin is added to the syringe to prevent clotting of the blood sample.\\n\\nB. Normal pH, HCO3, and PCO2 levels may not indicate absence of an acid-base imbalance - This is true. Normal values do not necessarily rule out the presence of an acid-base imbalance.\\n\\nC. A different site should be tried if modified Allen's test is negative - This is true. If the modified Allen's test is negative, it indicates inadequate collateral circulation and an alternative site should be used.\\n\\nD. Radial artery is the preferred site - This is generally true. The radial artery is commonly used for ABG sampling due to its accessibility and low risk of complications. However, other sites like the brachial or femoral artery can be used if necessary.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer choice that is NOT true about performing an ABG is B. Normal pH, HCO3, and PCO2 levels may not indicate absence of an acid-base imbalance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
