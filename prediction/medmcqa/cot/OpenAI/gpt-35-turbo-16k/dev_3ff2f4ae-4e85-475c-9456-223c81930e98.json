    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel prism demineralization refers to the process of mineral loss from the enamel prisms, which are the structural units of enamel. To determine the pattern of enamel prism demineralization, we need to consider the resistance to dissolution of the head and tail of the enamel prisms. The head of the enamel prism is the portion that is closer to the enamel surface, while the tail is the portion that is closer to the dentin. Recent studies have shown that the head of the enamel prism is more resistant to dissolution compared to the tail. This is because the head is exposed to the oral environment and is constantly subjected to the effects of acids and other factors that can lead to demineralization. On the other hand, the tail is protected by the dentin and is less exposed to these factors. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Head is more resistant to dissolution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
