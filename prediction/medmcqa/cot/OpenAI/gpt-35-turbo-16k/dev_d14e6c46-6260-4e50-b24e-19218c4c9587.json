    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tingling sensation in the limbs is a common side effect of certain medications, including anti-tubercular therapy. This side effect is often due to a deficiency of certain vitamins or nutrients. To determine which vitamin substitution can improve the symptoms, we need to consider the potential deficiencies caused by anti-tubercular therapy. Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, including tingling sensations. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) deficiency can also lead to neurological symptoms. Folic acid (Vitamin B9) deficiency is associated with anemia and can cause neurological symptoms in severe cases. Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12) deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, which can manifest as tingling sensations in the limbs. Considering these possibilities, the most appropriate vitamin substitution to improve the symptoms would be Methylcobalamine (Vitamin B12).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Methylcobalamine\"}"
