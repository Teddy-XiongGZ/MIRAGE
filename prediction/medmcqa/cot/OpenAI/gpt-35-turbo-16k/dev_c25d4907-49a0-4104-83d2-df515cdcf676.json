    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most appropriate initial investigation for a lactating mother with a painful breast lump is usually an ultrasound (USG). Mammography is not typically recommended for lactating women due to the increased density of breast tissue during lactation, which can make mammograms less accurate. MRI is generally reserved for further evaluation if the USG findings are inconclusive or if there is a suspicion of malignancy. X-ray is not typically used for evaluating breast lumps.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. USG\"}"
