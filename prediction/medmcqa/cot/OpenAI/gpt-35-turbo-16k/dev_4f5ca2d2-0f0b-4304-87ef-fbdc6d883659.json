    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a person lies down, several physiological changes occur. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. There is immediate increase in venous return: When a person lies down, the effect of gravity on blood flow changes. Blood that was pooling in the lower extremities due to gravity now has an easier time returning to the heart. This results in an increase in venous return.\\n\\nB. Heart rate becomes stable at slightly more than normal: When a person lies down, the heart rate tends to decrease due to the decreased demand on the cardiovascular system. Therefore, this option is not correct.\\n\\nC. Cerebral blood flow increases & becomes stable at more than normal: When a person lies down, the blood flow to the brain may increase slightly due to the redistribution of blood. However, it does not become stable at more than normal. Therefore, this option is not correct.\\n\\nD. Blood flow to the Apex of lung decreases: When a person lies down, the blood flow to the apex of the lung may decrease due to the effect of gravity. This is because the apex of the lung is located higher than the base, and blood flow is more prominent at the base. Therefore, this option is correct.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Blood flow to the Apex of lung decreases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
