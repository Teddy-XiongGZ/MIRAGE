    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The given symptoms include absent thumb, radial deviation of wrist, bowing of forearm, and thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by a low platelet count. The absence of thumb, radial deviation of the wrist, and bowing of the forearm are suggestive of a congenital anomaly known as radial ray deficiency. This condition is often associated with other abnormalities, including heart defects. Therefore, it is important to investigate for any associated cardiac abnormalities. Echocardiography is a non-invasive imaging test that can provide detailed information about the structure and function of the heart. Since cardiac abnormalities are commonly associated with radial ray deficiency, echocardiography should not be excluded from the investigation. On the other hand, bone marrow examination and karyotyping are not directly related to the symptoms described and are unlikely to provide useful information in this case. Platelet count, however, is relevant as it can help confirm the presence of thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the investigation that need not be done in this case is D. Karyotyping.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
