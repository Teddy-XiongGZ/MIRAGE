    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the tertiary monoblock system of obturation of the root canal, we need to understand the options provided. A. Resilon monoblock obturation: Resilon is a synthetic polymer-based material used for root canal obturation. It is not a tertiary monoblock system. B. Active Gutta percha: Gutta percha is a commonly used material for root canal obturation. However, active gutta percha is not a specific term or technique related to tertiary monoblock obturation. C. Orthograde obturation with MTA: MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate) is a material used in endodontics for various purposes, but it is not specifically associated with tertiary monoblock obturation. D. Gutta Percha and AH plus sealer: Gutta percha is a commonly used material for root canal obturation, and AH plus sealer is a resin-based sealer. This combination is commonly used in the technique known as the \"tapered cone\" or \"lateral condensation\" technique, which is a tertiary monoblock system of obturation. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Gutta Percha and AH plus sealer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
