    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Saliva production is primarily regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system is responsible for stimulating the production of saliva. Cholinergic drugs, which activate the parasympathetic system, can therefore increase saliva production. On the other hand, anticholinergic drugs block the effects of the parasympathetic system and can decrease saliva production. Adrenergic drugs, which activate the sympathetic nervous system, do not have a direct effect on saliva production. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Cholinergic drugs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
