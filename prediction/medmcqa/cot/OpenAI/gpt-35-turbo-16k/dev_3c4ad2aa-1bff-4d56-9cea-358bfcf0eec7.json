    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amalgam restorations are dental fillings made from a mixture of metals, including mercury. The residual mercury content in amalgam restorations is an important factor in determining their clinical service. To determine the best residual mercury content, we need to consider the composition of amalgam restorations. Amalgam restorations typically consist of approximately 50% mercury and a mixture of other metals such as silver, tin, and copper. The residual mercury content refers to the amount of mercury that remains in the amalgam after it has set and hardened. Based on this information, we can conclude that the best clinical service would be achieved when the residual mercury content is closest to the original composition of the amalgam, which is around 50%. Therefore, the answer is B. 48-52%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
