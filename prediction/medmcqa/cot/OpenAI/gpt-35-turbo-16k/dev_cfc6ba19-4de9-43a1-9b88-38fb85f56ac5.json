    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The attached gingiva is the firm, dense, and tightly bound tissue that surrounds the teeth and extends from the free gingival margin to the mucogingival junction. It is important for maintaining the stability and health of the gingiva. In children, the attached gingiva may have some unique characteristics compared to adults. Interdental clefts are not a unique characteristic of attached gingiva in children. Interdental clefts refer to the spaces between the teeth, which are not specific to the attached gingiva. Retrocuspid papilla is a small, rounded elevation of tissue located on the lingual aspect of the mandibular cuspid teeth. It is not directly related to the attached gingiva. Stillman's cleft is a V-shaped notch or groove that can occur in the attached gingiva. However, it is not a unique characteristic of attached gingiva in children. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both. Children may have interdental clefts and Stillman's clefts in their attached gingiva.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
