    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The conversion of glucose-6-P to fructose-6-P involves a change in the arrangement of atoms within the molecule, but no addition or removal of water molecules. This indicates that it is not a dehydration reaction. The reaction also does not involve the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond, so it is not an aldol cleavage. The conversion of glucose-6-P to fructose-6-P is a rearrangement of the atoms within the molecule, resulting in the formation of an isomer. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Isomerisation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
