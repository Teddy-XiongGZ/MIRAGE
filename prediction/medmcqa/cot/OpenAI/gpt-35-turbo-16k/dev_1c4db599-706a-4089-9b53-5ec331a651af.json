    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcification is the process of depositing calcium salts in tissues. Enzymes that play a role in calcification are likely to be involved in the metabolism of calcium. \\n\\nA. Enolase is not directly involved in calcium metabolism. Calcitonin is a hormone that regulates calcium levels but does not directly participate in calcification. \\n\\nB. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphate esters, including those found in calcium phosphate. Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide and is not directly involved in calcium metabolism. \\n\\nC. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphate esters, including those found in calcium phosphate. Pyrophosphatase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes pyrophosphate, which is involved in the metabolism of calcium. \\n\\nD. Pyrophosphatase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes pyrophosphate, which is involved in the metabolism of calcium. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid and is not directly involved in calcium metabolism. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is C. Alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
