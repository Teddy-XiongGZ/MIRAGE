    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The forces acting through a fixed partial denture on the abutment tooth should be directed in a way that minimizes stress and strain on the tooth and surrounding structures. The goal is to distribute the forces evenly and avoid excessive forces on any one area. A. As far as possible at right angles to the long axis of the teeth: This option is incorrect because directing the forces at right angles to the long axis of the teeth can create rotational forces and increase the risk of tooth movement or damage. B. Parallel to the long axis of the teeth: This option is correct. Directing the forces parallel to the long axis of the teeth helps to distribute the forces evenly and minimize stress on the abutment tooth. C. By decreasing the mesio-distal dimension: This option is incorrect. Decreasing the mesio-distal dimension refers to reducing the width of the prosthesis, which does not directly affect the direction of forces acting on the abutment tooth. D. None of the above: This option is incorrect because option B, directing the forces parallel to the long axis of the teeth, is the correct choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
