    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best finish line for an anterior metal ceramic crown depends on various factors such as esthetics, tooth preparation, and material used. However, in general, a chamfer with bevel or a shoulder with bevel is preferred for anterior metal ceramic crowns. A chamfer with bevel provides a smooth and rounded finish line, which helps in achieving good esthetics and reducing the risk of chipping or fracture of the ceramic material. On the other hand, a shoulder with bevel provides a more defined and precise finish line, which can be advantageous in cases where there is a need for better retention and resistance form. Heavy chamfer and shoulder without bevel are less commonly used options and may not provide optimal esthetics or strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Shoulder with bevel\"}"
