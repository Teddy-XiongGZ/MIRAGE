    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars can be determined by considering the anatomy of the tooth. Mandibular molars typically have two roots, a mesial root and a distal root. The mesial root usually has one main canal, while the distal root can have one or two canals. Accessory canals are additional canals that branch off from the main canal and extend into the root. A. A lateral canal extending from the coronal third to the furcal region in the distal canal is not a major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars. This option is incorrect. B. The presence of both lateral and furcal canals is a possible pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars. This means that there can be additional canals branching off from both the main canal and extending into the furcal region. This option is a possible answer. C. A single furcation canal extending from the pulp chamber to the intra-radicular region is not a major pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars. This option is incorrect. D. The pattern of accessory canals in mandibular molars can vary and depend on the age of the patient. This option is a possible answer. Considering the above explanations, the correct answer is either B or D, as both options describe possible patterns of accessory canals in mandibular molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/D\"}"
