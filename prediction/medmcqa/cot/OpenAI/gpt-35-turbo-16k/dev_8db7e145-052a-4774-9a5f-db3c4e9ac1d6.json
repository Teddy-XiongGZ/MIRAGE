    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The length of the humerus bone can be used to estimate a person's height. There is a positive correlation between the length of the humerus bone and height. To estimate the height, we can use the following formula: Height = (Length of humerus * 2.97) + 69.08. Plugging in the given length of the humerus (24.5 cm) into the formula, we get: Height = (24.5 * 2.97) + 69.08 = 72.765 + 69.08 = 141.845 cm. Therefore, the predicted height of this person is approximately 141.845 cm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
