    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total volume of the ceftriaxone solution required to give 180 mg. Since the concentration of the solution is 500 mg/5ml, we can set up a proportion: 500 mg/5 ml = 180 mg/x ml. Solving for x, we find that x = (180 mg * 5 ml) / 500 mg = 1.8 ml. Next, we need to determine how many divisions in the 2 ml syringe will correspond to 1.8 ml. Since there are 10 divisions per ml, we can multiply 1.8 ml by 10 to find the total number of divisions: 1.8 ml * 10 divisions/ml = 18 divisions. Therefore, the answer is B. 18 divisions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
