    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrates are commonly used in the treatment of acute angina attacks. They work by dilating the coronary arteries, which increases blood flow to the heart muscle. This helps to relieve the chest pain associated with angina. Nitrates also have the ability to relax smooth muscles, including those in the blood vessels, which leads to vasodilation. This vasodilation reduces the workload on the heart and decreases both preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart) and afterload (the resistance the heart has to pump against). However, the major mechanism of action of nitrates in the acute attack of angina is the coronary vasodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
