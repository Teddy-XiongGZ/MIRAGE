    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The neonate presenting with jaundice on the first day of life is concerning for pathological jaundice rather than physiological jaundice. Physiological jaundice typically appears after the first 24 hours of life and resolves within the first week. In this case, the mother's blood group being '0' positive suggests the possibility of ABO incompatibility, which can lead to hemolysis and subsequent jaundice in the neonate. Therefore, the appropriate management for this patient would be to perform a blood test to determine the neonate's blood group and direct Coombs test to confirm the presence of antibodies. If the Coombs test is positive, indicating ABO incompatibility, phototherapy would be the initial treatment of choice to manage the jaundice. Exchange transfusion is reserved for severe cases of hyperbilirubinemia that do not respond to phototherapy. Liver function tests and liver biopsy are not indicated as the primary management for this presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Phototherapy\"}"
