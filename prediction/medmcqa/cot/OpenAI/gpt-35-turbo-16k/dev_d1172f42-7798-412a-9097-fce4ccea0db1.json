    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most common route for metastasis of oral cancer can be determined by considering the anatomy and physiology of the oral cavity. Oral cancer can spread through direct extension, lymphatics, blood vessels, or aspiration of tumor cells. 1. Direct extension: Oral cancer can spread directly to adjacent structures such as the jawbone, tongue, or throat. However, this is not the most common route for metastasis. 2. Lymphatics: The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the spread of cancer cells. Lymph nodes in the neck are commonly involved in oral cancer metastasis. Therefore, lymphatics can be a potential route for metastasis. 3. Blood vessels: Cancer cells can enter the bloodstream and spread to distant organs. This process is known as hematogenous metastasis. While blood vessels can be a route for metastasis, it is not the most common route for oral cancer. 4. Aspiration of tumor cells: Aspiration refers to the inhalation of foreign substances into the respiratory tract. While it is possible for tumor cells to be aspirated and spread to other parts of the body, it is not the most common route for oral cancer metastasis. Considering the above information, the most common route for metastasis of oral cancer is through the lymphatics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
