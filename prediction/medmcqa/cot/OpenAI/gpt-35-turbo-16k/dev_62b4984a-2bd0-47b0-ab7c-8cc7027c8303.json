    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which one of the following is not a criterion for making a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase, we need to understand the diagnostic criteria for this condition. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The accelerated phase of CML is characterized by the presence of one or more of the following criteria: 1) Blasts 10-19% of WBC's in peripheral blood, 2) Basophils 10-19% of WBC's in peripheral blood, 3) Increasing spleen size unresponsive to therapy, and 4) Persistent thrombocytosis (>1000 x 109/L) unresponsive to therapy. We need to identify the criterion that is not part of the diagnostic criteria for accelerated phase CML.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
