    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the volume of filler, we need to consider the density of the filler material. Assuming the density of the filler material is constant, we can use the formula: volume = weight / density. Since the filler constitutes 75% by weight, it means that the remaining 25% is the resin matrix. Therefore, the volume of filler is 75% of the total volume of the composite. Now, we need to determine the percentage of the volume of filler. To do this, we divide the volume of filler by the total volume of the composite and multiply by 100. So, the percentage volume of filler is (75% / (75% + 25%)) * 100 = 75% * 100 / 100 = 75%. Therefore, the answer is 75%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
