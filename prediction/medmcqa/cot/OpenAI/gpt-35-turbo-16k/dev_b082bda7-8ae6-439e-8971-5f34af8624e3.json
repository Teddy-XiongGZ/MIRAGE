    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise, there are several physiological changes that occur. Let's analyze each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Cerebral blood flow increases if there is an increase in systolic blood pressure: This statement is incorrect. During exercise, cerebral blood flow may increase due to increased cardiac output, but it is not directly related to an increase in systolic blood pressure.\\n\\nB. Body temperature increases: This statement is correct. During exercise, the body generates heat, leading to an increase in body temperature.\\n\\nC. Blood flow to muscle increases after 1\u00bd minute: This statement is correct. During exercise, blood flow to the muscles increases to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients.\\n\\nD. Lymphatic flow from muscle decreases: This statement is incorrect. Lymphatic flow from the muscles actually increases during exercise to help remove waste products and toxins.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. Body temperature increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
