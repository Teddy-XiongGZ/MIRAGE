Zona occludens, also known as tight junctions, are protein complexes that form a barrier between cells, preventing the passage of molecules between them. \\n2. Zona adherens, also known as adherens junctions, are protein complexes that connect adjacent cells and provide mechanical strength to tissues. \\n3. Macula adherens, also known as desmosomes, are protein complexes that anchor intermediate filaments between cells, providing structural support. \\n4. Gap junctions are specialized protein channels that allow direct communication and exchange of small molecules between adjacent cells. \\n\\nNow, we need to identify which of these cell junctions is not present in the structure marked with the arrow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
