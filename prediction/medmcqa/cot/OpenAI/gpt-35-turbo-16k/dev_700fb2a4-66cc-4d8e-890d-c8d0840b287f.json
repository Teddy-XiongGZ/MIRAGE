    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which an opening is created in the neck to provide an alternative airway. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Increase dead air space: Dead air space refers to the portion of the respiratory system where no gas exchange occurs. Tracheostomy does not directly increase dead air space as it bypasses the upper airway and allows air to directly enter the lower airways.\\n\\nB. Increase respiratory resistance: Tracheostomy can actually decrease respiratory resistance as it bypasses the upper airway, which may be narrowed or obstructed in certain conditions.\\n\\nC. Decrease respiratory work: Tracheostomy can decrease respiratory work by providing a more efficient and direct route for air to enter the lungs, especially in cases of upper airway obstruction.\\n\\nD. Cause obstruction in respiration: Tracheostomy is performed to alleviate obstruction in respiration, so it does not cause obstruction.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Decrease respiratory work.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
