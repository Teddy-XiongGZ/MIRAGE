    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a periodontal pocket, which is a space that forms between the gum and tooth due to gum disease, there is an inflammatory response. This means that immune cells are recruited to the area to fight off infection. The connective tissue wall of a periodontal pocket is rich in immune cells. Plasma cells are a type of immune cell that produce antibodies, but they are not typically found in high numbers in the connective tissue wall of a periodontal pocket. Erythrocytes are red blood cells and are not typically involved in the immune response. Leukocytes are a broad category of white blood cells that include lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are a specific type of leukocyte that play a key role in the immune response. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. Lymphocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
