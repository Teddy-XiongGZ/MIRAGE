    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To remove non working side interference, we need to identify which cusps are causing the interference. Non working side interference occurs when the cusps on the side opposite to the direction of movement come into contact during jaw movement. In this case, we need to reduce the cusps that are causing the interference. Step 1: Determine the direction of movement. Step 2: Identify the cusps on the non working side that are causing the interference. Step 3: Reduce the cusps that are causing the interference. Based on the given options, the correct answer would be D. Either of the arch's supporting cusps should be reduced, as it is not specified whether the interference is caused by the maxillary or mandibular supporting cusps.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
