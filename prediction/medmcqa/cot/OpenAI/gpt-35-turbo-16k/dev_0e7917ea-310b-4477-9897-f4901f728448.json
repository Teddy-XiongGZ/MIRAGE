    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In electrophoresis, charged particles move towards the oppositely charged electrode. Lipoproteins are classified based on their density, and their density is determined by the amount of protein and lipid present. VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) are all lipoproteins that contain varying amounts of protein and lipid. Chylomicrons, on the other hand, are large lipoproteins that are primarily composed of triglycerides. Triglycerides are neutral molecules and do not have a charge. Therefore, chylomicrons do not move towards the charged end in electrophoresis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
