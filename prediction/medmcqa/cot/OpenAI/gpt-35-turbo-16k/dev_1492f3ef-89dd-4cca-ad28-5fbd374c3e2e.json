The articular disc is narrower in the center, allowing for movement of the condyle.\\n\\nC. Strengthened by lateral pterygoid: The lateral pterygoid muscle attaches to the articular disc and helps to stabilize and move the disc during jaw movements.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the correct answer is D. All of the above, as options B and C are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
