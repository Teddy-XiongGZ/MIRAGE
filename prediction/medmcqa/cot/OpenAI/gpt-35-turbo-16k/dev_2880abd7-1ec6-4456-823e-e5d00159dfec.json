    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pneumocystis jirovecii is a common opportunistic infection in patients with weakened immune systems, such as those on chemotherapy. Prophylaxis is the use of medications to prevent the occurrence of an infection. To determine the drug used for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii, we need to consider the drugs that are effective against this organism. Cotrimoxazole, also known as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is the drug of choice for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that is not specifically indicated for this purpose. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is used for its anti-inflammatory properties and is not effective against Pneumocystis jirovecii. Cephalosporins are a class of antibiotics that do not have activity against Pneumocystis jirovecii. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Cotrimoxazole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
