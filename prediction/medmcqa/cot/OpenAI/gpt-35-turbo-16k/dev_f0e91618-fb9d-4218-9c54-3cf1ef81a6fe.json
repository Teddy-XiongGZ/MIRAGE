    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and accumulation of highly branched glycogen called limit dextrins suggests a glycogen storage disease. McArdle's disease (A) is characterized by muscle cramps and exercise intolerance, not hepatomegaly or hypoglycemia. Anderson's disease (B) is a disorder of lipid metabolism and does not involve glycogen storage. Cori's disease (D) is characterized by hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia, but the glycogen accumulation in Cori's disease is in the form of short outer chains. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the given symptoms is von Gierke's disease (C), which is characterized by hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and accumulation of highly branched glycogen called limit dextrins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
