    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a case of hypothermia, it is important to measure the core body temperature accurately. The ideal site to measure core body temperature is the rectal temperature. This is because the rectal temperature closely reflects the core body temperature and is less affected by external factors such as ambient temperature. Other sites like oral, tympanic membrane, and armpit may not provide an accurate measurement in cases of hypothermia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Rectal\"}"
