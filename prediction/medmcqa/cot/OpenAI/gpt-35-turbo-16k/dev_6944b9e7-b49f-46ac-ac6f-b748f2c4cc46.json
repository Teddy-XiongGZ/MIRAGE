    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome involves various tests to detect the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Amniotic fluid volume estimation: This test is not specific for Down's syndrome and is primarily used to assess the overall health of the fetus and detect certain birth defects.\\n\\nB. Alpha-fetoprotein estimation: This test is used to screen for neural tube defects and certain chromosomal abnormalities, but it is not specific for Down's syndrome.\\n\\nC. Cordocentesis: Also known as fetal blood sampling, this invasive procedure involves taking a sample of the baby's blood from the umbilical cord. It can be used to directly analyze the baby's chromosomes and detect Down's syndrome.\\n\\nD. Chorionic villous biopsy: This procedure involves taking a sample of cells from the placenta to analyze the baby's chromosomes. It is commonly used for antenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome.\\n\\nBased on this information, the option that is not done for antenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome is B. Alpha-fetoprotein estimation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
