    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the infant mortality rate, we need to divide the number of infant deaths (deaths before 1 year of age) by the number of live births and then multiply by 1,000. First, we need to calculate the number of live births. The total number of deaths in that year is given as 500. From this, we subtract the number of deaths before 28 days of life (56), the number of deaths between 28 days and 1 year (34), and the number of deaths showing no signs of life at birth (56). This gives us the number of live births, which is 500 - 56 - 34 - 56 = 354. Next, we calculate the infant mortality rate by dividing the number of infant deaths (56 + 34) by the number of live births (354) and multiplying by 1,000. This gives us (56 + 34) / 354 * 1,000 = 90.4. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 197.4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
