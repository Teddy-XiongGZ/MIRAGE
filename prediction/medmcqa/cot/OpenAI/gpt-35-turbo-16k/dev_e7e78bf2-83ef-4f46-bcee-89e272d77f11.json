    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lateral movement of the condyle refers to the movement of the mandibular condyle (part of the jaw joint) towards the side. To determine which muscle is responsible for this movement, we need to consider the muscles involved in jaw movement. The lateral pterygoid muscle is the primary muscle responsible for lateral movement of the mandible. It is located on both sides of the jaw joint. The contralateral lateral pterygoid refers to the muscle on the opposite side of the jaw joint, while the ipsilateral lateral pterygoid refers to the muscle on the same side of the jaw joint. The medial pterygoid muscle is not directly involved in lateral movement of the condyle. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Ispilateral lateral pterygoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
