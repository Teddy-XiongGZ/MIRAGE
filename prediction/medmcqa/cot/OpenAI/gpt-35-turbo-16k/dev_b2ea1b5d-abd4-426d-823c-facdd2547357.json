    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bending orthodontic wire at room temperature is an example of work/strain hardening. This process involves deforming the material, which increases its strength and hardness. Tempering is a heat treatment process used to increase the toughness of a material. Age hardening and precipitation hardening are also heat treatment processes, but they involve the formation of precipitates within the material to increase its strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Work/ Strain hardening\"}"
