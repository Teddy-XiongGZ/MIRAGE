    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During cryosurgery, the targeted cells are frozen using extremely cold temperatures. The freezing process causes damage to the cells, leading to their death. This is achieved by creating ice crystals within the cells, which disrupts their structure and function. As a result, the cells undergo necrosis and eventually die. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Cell death occurs when the temperature falls below -20\u00b0C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
