    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bilateral papillary necrosis is a condition characterized by the death of the renal papillae, which are the small, nipple-like structures at the tips of the renal pyramids. It is often associated with conditions that cause ischemia or inflammation of the kidneys. In this case, the patient presents with abdominal pain and CECT shows bilateral papillary necrosis. To investigate the cause of her papillary necrosis, several tests can be done. A. Urine acidification test: This test measures the ability of the kidneys to acidify urine. It is not directly related to the investigation of papillary necrosis, so it may not be necessary in this case. B. Sickling test: This test is used to diagnose sickle cell disease, which is a genetic disorder that can cause vaso-occlusive crises and ischemia in various organs, including the kidneys. Since ischemia can be a cause of papillary necrosis, this test may be relevant and should not be excluded. C. Urine-PCR for TB: Tuberculosis (TB) can cause renal involvement, including papillary necrosis. Therefore, performing a urine PCR for TB can be a relevant investigation in this case. D. Bacterial culture of urine: Infections, including urinary tract infections, can lead to inflammation and ischemia in the kidneys, which can contribute to papillary necrosis. Therefore, performing a bacterial culture of urine can be a relevant investigation in this case. Based on the above reasoning, the test that shall not be done to investigate the cause of her papillary necrosis is the urine acidification test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
