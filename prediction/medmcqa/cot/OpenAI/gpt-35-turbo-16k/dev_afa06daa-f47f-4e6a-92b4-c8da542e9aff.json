    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Magnesium is a cofactor for many enzymes in the body. To determine which enzyme requires magnesium, we can eliminate the enzymes that do not require magnesium. Phosphatase is an enzyme that removes phosphate groups from molecules and does not require magnesium. Aldolase is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of sugar molecules and does not require magnesium. Dismutase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of one molecule into two molecules and does not require magnesium. ATPase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP to release energy and requires magnesium as a cofactor. Therefore, the correct answer is D. ATPase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
