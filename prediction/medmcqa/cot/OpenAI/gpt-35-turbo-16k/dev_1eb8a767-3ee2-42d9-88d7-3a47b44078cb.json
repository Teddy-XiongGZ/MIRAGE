    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During a mandibular nerve block, the target nerve being blocked is the mandibular nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve. The mandibular nerve provides sensory innervation to the lower jaw, lower teeth, and the temporomandibular joint. It also innervates the muscles of mastication. The mandibular nerve does not directly innervate the abducens, facial, vagus, or trochlear nerves. Therefore, during a mandibular nerve block, none of these nerves would be directly damaged.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
