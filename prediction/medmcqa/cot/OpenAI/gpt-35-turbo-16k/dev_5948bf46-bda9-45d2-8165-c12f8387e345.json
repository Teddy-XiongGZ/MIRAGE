    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ketogenic amino acids are those that can be converted into ketone bodies, while glucogenic amino acids are those that can be converted into glucose. To determine which amino acids are both ketogenic and glucogenic, we need to consider their metabolic pathways. Isoleucine and leucine are both ketogenic amino acids, meaning they can be converted into ketone bodies but not glucose. Arginine is a glucogenic amino acid, meaning it can be converted into glucose but not ketone bodies. Glycine is neither ketogenic nor glucogenic. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
