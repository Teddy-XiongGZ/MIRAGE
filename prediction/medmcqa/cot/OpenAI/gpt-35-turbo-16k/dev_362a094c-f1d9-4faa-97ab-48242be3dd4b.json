    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zone of stimulation refers to the area where bone remodeling is actively occurring. This process involves the activity of various cells, including fibroblasts, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts. Fibroblasts are responsible for producing collagen and other extracellular matrix components. Osteoclasts are involved in bone resorption, while osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation. Therefore, options A, B, and C are all likely to be present in the zone of stimulation. On the other hand, new bone formation is a result of the activity of osteoblasts, so it is expected to be present in the zone of stimulation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. New bone formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
