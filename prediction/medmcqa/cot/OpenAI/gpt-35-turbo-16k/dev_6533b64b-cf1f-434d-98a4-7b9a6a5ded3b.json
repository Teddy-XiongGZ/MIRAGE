    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the upper denture falls when the patient opens their mouth wide, it indicates a problem with the stability of the denture. Let's consider each option: A. Thick labial flange refers to the thickness of the front part of the denture that rests against the lips. This is unlikely to cause the denture to fall when the mouth is opened wide. B. Over-extended borders means that the borders of the denture extend beyond the natural contours of the patient's mouth. This can lead to instability and the denture falling. C. Thick disto-buccal flange refers to the thickness of the back part of the denture that rests against the cheek. While this can contribute to instability, it is less likely to be the primary cause of the denture falling. D. Poor peripheral seal refers to a lack of proper fit and seal between the denture and the patient's oral tissues. This can result in the denture becoming loose and falling when the mouth is opened wide. Considering these options, the most likely cause of the upper denture falling when the patient opens their mouth wide is D. Poor peripheral seal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
