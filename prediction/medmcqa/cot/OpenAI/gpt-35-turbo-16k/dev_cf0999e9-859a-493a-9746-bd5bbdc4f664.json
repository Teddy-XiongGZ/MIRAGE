    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar levels by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. It is commonly used in the management of hypoglycemia. Now, let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Large for date baby: Large for date baby refers to a baby that is larger than expected for its gestational age. This condition is usually associated with maternal diabetes. Since the baby is already at risk for hypoglycemia due to maternal diabetes, glucagon injection can be effective in managing persistent hypoglycemia. \\n\\nB. Galactosemia: Galactosemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Glucagon injection is not effective in managing hypoglycemia caused by galactosemia. \\n\\nC. Infant of diabetic mother: Infants born to diabetic mothers are at risk for hypoglycemia due to the sudden withdrawal of maternal glucose after birth. Glucagon injection can be effective in managing persistent hypoglycemia in infants of diabetic mothers. \\n\\nD. Nesidioblastosis: Nesidioblastosis is a rare condition characterized by excessive insulin secretion by the pancreas. Glucagon injection is not effective in managing hypoglycemia caused by nesidioblastosis. \\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the answer is B. Galactosemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
