    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The contraction of skeletal muscles involves a complex process. Let's break it down step-by-step:\\n\\n1. When a nerve impulse reaches the neuromuscular junction, it triggers the release of acetylcholine.\\n2. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the muscle cell membrane, causing depolarization.\\n3. This depolarization spreads along the muscle cell membrane and into the T-tubules.\\n4. The depolarization of the T-tubules causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\\n5. The released calcium ions bind to troponin, a protein on the actin filaments.\\n6. The binding of calcium to troponin causes a conformational change, which moves tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin.\\n7. With the myosin-binding sites exposed, the myosin heads can bind to actin and form cross-bridges.\\n8. The myosin heads undergo a power stroke, pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere.\\n9. ATP is required for the detachment of the myosin heads from actin and the re-energizing of the myosin heads for another power stroke.\\n\\nBased on this step-by-step process, the correct answer is C. Contraction is initiated by calcium binding to troponin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
