    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The p-value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis (Ho). It represents the probability of obtaining the observed data or more extreme data if the null hypothesis is true. In hypothesis testing, we compare the p-value to a predetermined significance level (usually 0.05) to make a decision. If the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis (Ho) and conclude that there is evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (H1). On the other hand, if the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (Ho) and do not have enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (H1).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Rejective Ho, p <0.05\"}"
