    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Severe acidosis is a condition characterized by a low pH in the blood. The treatment for severe acidosis depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) may be used to correct the acidosis by increasing the pH of the blood. Ringers lactate and dextrose are not typically used as treatments for acidosis. Ringers lactate is a solution used for fluid resuscitation and dextrose is a form of sugar used for energy. Therefore, the correct answer is A. i.v. NaHCo3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
