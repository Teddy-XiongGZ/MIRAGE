    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is typically caused by common respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The most commonly used drug for the management of CAP is usually an antibiotic that covers these pathogens. Vancomycin is not typically used as a first-line treatment for CAP, as it is more commonly used for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Streptomycin is not commonly used for the treatment of CAP. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers many of the common pathogens causing CAP, but it is not the most commonly used drug. Azithromycin, on the other hand, is a commonly used antibiotic for the management of CAP, as it covers both typical and atypical pathogens. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Azithromycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
