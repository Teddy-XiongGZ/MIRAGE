    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Annealing is a heat treatment process that involves heating a material to a specific temperature and then slowly cooling it. The purpose of annealing is to reduce the hardness and increase the ductility of the material. It is commonly used to relieve internal stresses, improve machinability, and enhance the material's microstructure. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Stress relieving heat treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
