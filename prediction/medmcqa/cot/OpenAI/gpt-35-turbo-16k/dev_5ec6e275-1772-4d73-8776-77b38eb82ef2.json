    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which drug has gameticidal action against all species of plasmodium, we need to consider the mechanism of action of each drug. Primaquine is known to have gametocidal activity against all species of plasmodium, making it an effective drug for preventing transmission of malaria. Chloroquine, on the other hand, primarily acts against the asexual erythrocytic stages of plasmodium and does not have gametocidal activity. Quinine is also primarily used for treating the asexual erythrocytic stages of plasmodium and does not have gametocidal activity. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Primaquine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
