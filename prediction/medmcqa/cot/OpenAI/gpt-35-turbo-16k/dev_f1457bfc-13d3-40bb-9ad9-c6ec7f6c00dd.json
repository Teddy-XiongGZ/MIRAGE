    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The otic ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion located in the infratemporal fossa. To determine which nerve carries the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the otic ganglion, we need to consider the anatomical connections. The greater petrosal nerve carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the superior salivatory nucleus to the pterygopalatine ganglion. The lesser petrosal nerve carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the inferior salivatory nucleus to the otic ganglion. The chorda tympani carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the superior salivatory nucleus to the submandibular ganglion. The auriculotemporal nerve carries sensory fibers from the auricle and skin of the temporal region. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Lesser petrosal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
