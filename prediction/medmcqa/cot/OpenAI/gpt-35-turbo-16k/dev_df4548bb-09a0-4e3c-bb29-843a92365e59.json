    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heavy and light body impression materials are used in dentistry for making accurate molds of the teeth and surrounding tissues. Heavy body materials have a higher viscosity and are used to create a stable base or tray for the impression. Light body materials have a lower viscosity and are used to capture fine details and reproduce the soft tissues. Mercaptan is a type of impression material, but it is not commonly used as a heavy or light body material. Silicone is a commonly used material for both heavy and light body impressions. It is available in different viscosities to suit the specific needs of the impression. Reversible hydrocolloid, also known as alginate, is a type of impression material that is typically used for preliminary impressions and not for heavy or light body impressions. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. 1 and 2, which refers to Mercaptan and Silicone being used with heavy and light body impression materials.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
