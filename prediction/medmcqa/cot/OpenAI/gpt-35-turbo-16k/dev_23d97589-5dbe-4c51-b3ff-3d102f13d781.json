    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the number of pregnant women registered in the sub-center, we need to calculate the crude birth rate. The crude birth rate is the number of live births per 1,000 population in a given year. Given that the crude birth rate for the sub-center is 20, we can use this information to estimate the number of pregnant women registered. To do this, we can use the formula: Number of pregnant women = (Crude birth rate / 1,000) * Total population. However, since we don't have the total population, we cannot calculate the exact number of pregnant women registered. Therefore, we cannot determine the answer based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot determine\"}"
