    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a tooth is tipped, it means that it is tilted or inclined in one direction. The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a connective tissue that surrounds and attaches the tooth to the surrounding bone. It contains collagen fibers that provide support and stability to the tooth. When the tooth is tipped, the fibers of the PDL will experience changes in tension and compression. In the case of tipping, the fibers of the PDL on the side towards which the tooth is tilted will be stretched. This is because the tooth is being pulled away from the bone in that direction. On the other hand, the fibers of the PDL on the opposite side of the tilt will be compressed. This is because the tooth is being pushed towards the bone in that direction. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Half compressed half stretched.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
