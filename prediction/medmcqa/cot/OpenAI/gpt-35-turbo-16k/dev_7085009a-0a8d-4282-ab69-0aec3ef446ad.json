    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a bus accident, the priority for shifting patients to the hospital is determined by the severity of their condition and the potential for immediate life-threatening complications. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Severe haemorrhage with leg fracture: Severe bleeding can be life-threatening, but if it can be controlled on-site, the patient may not require immediate hospital transfer.\\n\\nB. Head injury: Head injuries can be serious and potentially life-threatening. Depending on the severity of the head injury, this patient may require immediate transfer to the hospital.\\n\\nC. Circulation shock: Circulatory shock is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. Patients in circulatory shock should be given high priority for hospital transfer.\\n\\nD. Airway obstruction: Airway obstruction can quickly lead to respiratory distress and potentially cardiac arrest. This is also a high-priority condition that requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nBased on the severity and potential for immediate life-threatening complications, the patient with circulation shock should be given more priority to shift to the hospital.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
