    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To differentiate among maxillary 1st, 2nd, and 3rd molars, we need to consider the distinguishing features of each tooth. The relative position of the DL groove refers to the groove on the distolingual aspect of the tooth. The relative position of the ML groove refers to the groove on the mesiolingual aspect of the tooth. ML cusp size refers to the size of the cusp on the mesiolingual aspect of the tooth. The oblique ridge is a ridge that runs obliquely across the occlusal surface of the tooth. The most constant and valuable trait to differentiate among maxillary 1st, 2nd, and 3rd molars is the relative position of the ML groove. This is because the ML groove is consistently located in a specific position on each molar, allowing for reliable differentiation between the three molars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
