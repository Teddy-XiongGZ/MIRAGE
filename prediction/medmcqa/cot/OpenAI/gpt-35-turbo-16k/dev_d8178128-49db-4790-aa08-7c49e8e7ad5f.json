    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the shape of the access cavity of the mandibular 1st molar, we need to consider the anatomy of the tooth. The mandibular 1st molar typically has two roots, a mesial root and a distal root. The access cavity is created to gain access to the pulp chamber and root canals. The shape of the access cavity is influenced by the position and orientation of the roots. In the case of the mandibular 1st molar, the access cavity is typically oval in shape. This is because the mesial root is positioned more mesially, while the distal root is positioned more distally. The oval shape allows for adequate access to both roots and facilitates proper instrumentation and cleaning of the root canals. Therefore, the answer is A. Oval.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
