    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iontophoresis is a technique that uses an electric current to deliver medication or other substances through the skin. Fluoride is sometimes used in iontophoresis for the treatment of dental conditions such as tooth sensitivity. To determine the percentage of fluoride used in iontophoresis, we need to consider the concentration of fluoride typically used in dental treatments. The most commonly used concentration of fluoride in dental treatments is 1.23%. However, it is important to note that the concentration of fluoride used in iontophoresis may vary depending on the specific treatment protocol and the patient's needs. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be determined based on the information provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
