    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation exposure affects different tissues and organs in different ways. To determine which of the given options is least sensitive to radiation exposure, we need to consider the effects of radiation on each option. A. Bone: Bone tissue is relatively sensitive to radiation exposure, as it can lead to bone marrow suppression and increased risk of bone cancer. B. Hematopoietic tissue: Hematopoietic tissue, which includes the bone marrow where blood cells are produced, is highly sensitive to radiation exposure. Radiation can cause damage to the bone marrow, leading to decreased production of blood cells and increased risk of blood disorders. C. Nerve: Nerve tissue is relatively resistant to radiation exposure. While high doses of radiation can cause damage to nerves, it generally requires higher levels of radiation exposure compared to other tissues. D. Muscle: Muscle tissue is also relatively resistant to radiation exposure. It is less sensitive compared to bone and hematopoietic tissue. Based on the above information, the option that is least sensitive to radiation exposure is D. Muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
