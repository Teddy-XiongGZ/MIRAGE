    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biliary atresia is a condition characterized by the obstruction or absence of the bile ducts, leading to bile flow impairment. It is a common cause of neonatal cholestasis. To rule out biliary atresia in a 2-month-old child, the investigation of choice is typically an ultrasound (USG). USG can help visualize the biliary system and identify any abnormalities or obstructions. Hepatic scintigraphy can also be used to evaluate the liver function and detect any bile flow abnormalities. ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and CT scan are not typically the initial investigations of choice for ruling out biliary atresia in a 2-month-old child.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
