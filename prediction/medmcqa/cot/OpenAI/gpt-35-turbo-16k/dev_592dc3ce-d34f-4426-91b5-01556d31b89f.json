    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which marker is not expressed on the surface of T-cells at some stage of development, we need to consider the expression patterns of each marker. \\n\\nA. CDIa: CDIa is a marker that is expressed on the surface of T-cells at some stage of development. \\n\\nB. PAX5: PAX5 is a transcription factor that is not typically expressed on the surface of T-cells. It is involved in B-cell development. \\n\\nC. CD34: CD34 is a marker that is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells, including T-cell precursors. \\n\\nD. Tdt: Tdt, or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, is an enzyme that is expressed during early stages of T-cell development. \\n\\nBased on this information, the marker that is not expressed on the surface of T-cells at some stage of development is B. PAX5.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
