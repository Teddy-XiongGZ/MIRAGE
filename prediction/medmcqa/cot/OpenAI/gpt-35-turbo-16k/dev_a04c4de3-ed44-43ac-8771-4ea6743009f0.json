    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's calculate the initial rate of the reaction. The initial rate of a reaction can be determined by dividing the change in product concentration by the change in time. In this case, after 9 minutes, 170 substrate is converted to product, which is a change of 170 - 0 = 170 substrate. The change in time is 9 - 0 = 9 minutes. Therefore, the initial rate of the reaction is 170 substrate / 9 minutes = 18.89 substrate/minute. Next, let's calculate the Vmax of the reaction. Vmax is the maximum rate of the reaction when the enzyme is saturated with substrate. Since the concentration of the substrate is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme, we can assume that the enzyme is saturated with substrate. Therefore, the initial rate of the reaction is equal to the Vmax. Now, let's calculate the Km value of the enzyme. Since the concentration of the substrate is 1000 times the Km value, we can assume that the concentration of the substrate is much higher than the Km value. Therefore, we can use the initial rate of the reaction (Vmax) to calculate the Km value using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Rearranging the equation, we have Km = Vmax / 2. In this case, Km = 18.89 substrate/minute / 2 = 9.445 substrate/minute. Now, let's calculate the new initial rate of the reaction when the concentration of the enzyme is changed to 1/3 and the concentration of the substrate is doubled. The new initial rate can be determined by dividing the change in product concentration by the change in time. In this case, we want to find the time taken to convert the substrate into 12 microgram/ml, which is a change of 12 - 0 = 12 microgram/ml. The change in time is what we want to find. Therefore, the new initial rate of the reaction is 12 microgram/ml / x minutes, where x is the time taken to convert the substrate into 12 microgram/ml. Since the concentration of the enzyme is changed to 1/3, the new Vmax of the reaction is 1/3 * Vmax = 1/3 * 18.89 substrate/minute = 6.2967 substrate/minute. Since the concentration of the substrate is doubled, the new Km value of the enzyme is 2 * Km = 2 * 9.445 substrate/minute = 18.89 substrate/minute. Using the new Vmax and Km values, we can calculate the new initial rate of the reaction. The new initial rate is equal to the new Vmax divided by the new Km. Therefore, the new initial rate is 6.2967 substrate/minute / 18.89 substrate/minute = 0.333 substrate/minute. Now, let's set up the equation to find the time taken to convert the substrate into 12 microgram/ml. The equation is 0.333 substrate/minute * x minutes = 12 microgram/ml. Solving for x, we have x = 12 microgram/ml / 0.333 substrate/minute = 36.036 minutes. Therefore, the time taken to convert the substrate into 12 microgram/ml is approximately 36.036 minutes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 27 minutes\"}"
