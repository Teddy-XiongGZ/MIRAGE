    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vitreous humor is the gel-like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina in the eye. It is different from blood in terms of its composition. To determine the high concentration of a substance in vitreous humor compared to blood, we need to consider the normal concentration of that substance in blood. A. Sodium: Sodium is an electrolyte that is present in both blood and vitreous humor. However, the concentration of sodium is higher in blood compared to vitreous humor. Therefore, sodium does not have a high concentration in vitreous humor compared to blood. B. Potassium: Potassium is also an electrolyte that is present in both blood and vitreous humor. However, the concentration of potassium is higher in blood compared to vitreous humor. Therefore, potassium does not have a high concentration in vitreous humor compared to blood. C. Glucose: Glucose is a sugar that serves as a major energy source for cells. The concentration of glucose in blood is tightly regulated, and it is typically higher in blood compared to vitreous humor. Therefore, glucose does not have a high concentration in vitreous humor compared to blood. D. Ascorbate: Ascorbate, also known as Vitamin C, is an antioxidant that is present in both blood and vitreous humor. However, the concentration of ascorbate is significantly higher in vitreous humor compared to blood. Therefore, ascorbate has a high concentration in vitreous humor compared to blood. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Ascorbate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
