    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Beta thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells. In beta thalassemia, there is a reduced or absent production of beta globin chains, leading to an imbalance in the production of alpha and beta globin chains. This imbalance results in ineffective erythropoiesis and destruction of red blood cells. Since beta thalassemia leads to a decreased production of hemoglobin, the red blood cells are typically hypochromic, meaning they have a reduced amount of hemoglobin. Additionally, the red blood cells are also microcytic, meaning they are smaller in size than normal. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Microcytic and hypochromic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
