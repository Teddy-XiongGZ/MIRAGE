    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the fetal heart rate drops, it can be due to various reasons. In this case, the drop in fetal heart rate is typically associated with umbilical cord compression. Let's go through the options to determine the correct answer:\\n\\nA. Early deceleration: Early decelerations are gradual decreases in the fetal heart rate that mirror the contractions of the mother. They are typically caused by head compression during labor and are considered a normal finding.\\n\\nB. Late deceleration: Late decelerations are gradual decreases in the fetal heart rate that occur after the peak of a contraction. They are usually associated with uteroplacental insufficiency and can be a sign of fetal distress.\\n\\nC. Variable deceleration: Variable decelerations are abrupt decreases in the fetal heart rate that vary in duration, depth, and timing. They are typically caused by umbilical cord compression and are considered a common finding.\\n\\nD. Prolonged deceleration: Prolonged decelerations are sustained decreases in the fetal heart rate that last longer than 2 minutes. They can be caused by various factors, including umbilical cord compression, fetal head compression, or placental insufficiency.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is C. Variable deceleration, as it is the drop in fetal heart rate that is typically associated with umbilical cord compression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
