    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common complication of ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy). ECT is a medical procedure used to treat certain mental illnesses, such as severe depression. To determine the most common complication, we need to consider the potential side effects of ECT. A. Antegrade amnesia: This refers to the inability to form new memories after the procedure. While it is a known side effect of ECT, it is not the most common complication. B. Retrograde amnesia: This refers to the loss of memories that occurred before the procedure. It is also a known side effect of ECT, but it is not the most common complication. C. Psychosis: Psychosis is a condition characterized by a loss of contact with reality. While ECT can cause temporary confusion and disorientation immediately after the procedure, it is not a common long-term complication. D. Depression: ECT is actually used as a treatment for severe depression, so it is unlikely to be a complication of the procedure. Based on the above analysis, the most common complication of ECT is likely to be either antegrade amnesia or retrograde amnesia. However, since the question asks for the 'most' common complication, we can conclude that the answer is: A. Antegrade amnesia\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
