    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When comparing gel form and liquid form of etchant, there are several factors to consider. Gel form of etchant is preferred over liquid form because it provides better control over placement. This is because the gel has a thicker consistency and can be easily manipulated and applied precisely to the desired area. Additionally, gel form of etchant enhances and concentrates the action of acid. The gel adheres to the tooth surface and stays in place, allowing for a longer contact time and a more effective etching process. Lastly, gel form of etchant helps in visualization while placement. The gel is usually colored, making it easier for the dentist to see where it has been applied and ensure complete coverage. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Helps in visualization while placement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
