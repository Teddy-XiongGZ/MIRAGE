    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic medication. To determine how it produces its antiarrhythmic effects, we need to consider its mechanism of action. Lidocaine works by blocking sodium channels, which are responsible for the depolarization phase of the action potential in cardiac cells. By blocking sodium channels, lidocaine decreases the excitability of cardiac cells and reduces their ability to generate and conduct electrical impulses. This leads to a decrease in cardiac excitability and a decrease in spontaneous pacemaker activity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Decreasing cardiac excitability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
