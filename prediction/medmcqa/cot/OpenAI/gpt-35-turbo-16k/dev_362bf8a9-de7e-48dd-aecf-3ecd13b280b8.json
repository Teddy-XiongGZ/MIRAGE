    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If the force level declines to zero between activations, it means that the force is not continuously applied. This rules out option A, continuous force. The force is also not consistently interrupted, as it only declines to zero between activations. This rules out option B, interrupted force. The force is applied intermittently, meaning it is not continuous but has periods of activation and periods of no force. Therefore, the correct classification for this force duration is C. Intermittent force.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
