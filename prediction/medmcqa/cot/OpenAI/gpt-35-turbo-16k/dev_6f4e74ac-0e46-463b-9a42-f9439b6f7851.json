    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In hyperparathyroidism, there is excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands. PTH plays a role in regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body. When PTH levels are elevated, it leads to increased calcium reabsorption from the bones and increased calcium absorption from the intestines. However, PTH also has an effect on phosphate levels. PTH decreases renal phosphate reabsorption, leading to increased phosphate excretion in the urine. Therefore, the decreased phosphate levels seen in hyperparathyroidism are primarily due to increased loss of phosphate in the urine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
