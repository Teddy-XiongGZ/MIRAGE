    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Postpartum hemorrhage is excessive bleeding after childbirth. The main cause of postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony, which is the failure of the uterus to contract after delivery. The treatment of postpartum hemorrhage involves stimulating uterine contractions to stop the bleeding. Oxytocin is the first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage as it stimulates uterine contractions. Syntometrine, which is a combination of oxytocin and ergometrine, is also commonly used.
