    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental plaque is a biofilm that forms on the teeth. It is primarily composed of bacteria and their byproducts. To answer this question, we need to understand why dental plaque adheres to the tooth. A. Levans are gummy: Levans are polysaccharides produced by some bacteria. While they can contribute to the formation of dental plaque, they are not the primary reason for its adherence to the tooth. B. Dextrans are insoluble and sticky: Dextrans are also polysaccharides produced by bacteria. They are known to be sticky and can contribute to the adherence of dental plaque to the tooth. This is a possible answer. C. Plaque grows into the irregularities: While dental plaque can grow into the irregularities of the tooth surface, this is not the primary reason for its adherence. D. Microorganisms produce sticky lipoproteins: This is a possible answer. Some microorganisms in dental plaque produce sticky lipoproteins that help in its adherence to the tooth. Considering the options, both B and D are plausible explanations for why dental plaque adheres to the tooth. However, the primary reason for its adherence is the production of sticky dextrans by bacteria. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
