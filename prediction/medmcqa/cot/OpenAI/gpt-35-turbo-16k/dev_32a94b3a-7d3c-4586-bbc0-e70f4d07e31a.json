    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Brachycephaly is a condition characterized by a short and wide head shape. It is typically caused by premature fusion of the cranial sutures, which are the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull. To determine which suture is responsible for brachycephaly, we need to understand the normal skull shape and the sutures involved. The sagittal suture runs along the top of the skull, dividing it into left and right halves. The coronal suture runs from side to side, separating the frontal bone from the parietal bones. The lambdoid suture is located at the back of the skull, separating the occipital bone from the parietal bones. Brachycephaly is specifically associated with fusion of the coronal suture, which leads to a shortening of the skull from front to back. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Coronal suture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
