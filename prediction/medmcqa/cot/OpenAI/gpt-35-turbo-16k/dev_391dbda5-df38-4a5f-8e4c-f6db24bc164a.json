    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The refractive power of the eye is primarily determined by the cornea and the lens. The cornea is responsible for about two-thirds of the eye's total refractive power, while the lens contributes the remaining one-third. The refractive power of the cornea is mainly determined by the curvature of its anterior surface, so the maximum contribution to the refractive power of the eye is by the anterior surface of the cornea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
