    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The typical cervical vertebrae can be differentiated from thoracic vertebrae based on several characteristics. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Has a triangular body: This is not a characteristic that distinguishes cervical vertebrae from thoracic vertebrae. Both cervical and thoracic vertebrae have a roughly rectangular-shaped body.\\n\\nB. Has a foramen transversarium: This is a characteristic of cervical vertebrae. The foramen transversarium is a hole in the transverse process of cervical vertebrae that allows the passage of the vertebral artery and vein.\\n\\nC. Superior articular facet directed backwards and upwards: This is a characteristic of cervical vertebrae. The superior articular facet of cervical vertebrae is directed posteriorly and superiorly, allowing for a greater range of motion in the neck.\\n\\nD. Has a large vertebral body: This is not a characteristic that distinguishes cervical vertebrae from thoracic vertebrae. Both cervical and thoracic vertebrae have different sizes of vertebral bodies, but neither can be described as uniformly large or small.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. Has a foramen transversarium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
