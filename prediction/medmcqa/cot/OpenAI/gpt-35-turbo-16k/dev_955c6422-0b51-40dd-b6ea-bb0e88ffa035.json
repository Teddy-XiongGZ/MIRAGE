    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel rods are the structural units of enamel. Let's evaluate each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Length of enamel rods is same as the thickness of enamel: This statement is true. Enamel rods extend from the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) to the outer surface of the tooth, so their length is equal to the thickness of enamel.\\n\\nB. Enamel rods are narrow at DEJ and wide at tooth surface: This statement is true. Enamel rods have a keyhole-shaped cross-section, with a narrower end at the DEJ and a wider end at the tooth surface.\\n\\nC. Under light microscope seen as Fish scale: This statement is true. Enamel rods, when viewed under a light microscope, appear as fish scale-like structures due to their overlapping arrangement.\\n\\nD. Tail is more resistant to caries than the core: This statement is false. The tail of the enamel rod is actually more susceptible to caries than the core. The core of the enamel rod is composed of densely packed hydroxyapatite crystals, which provide greater resistance to caries compared to the tail, which contains more organic material. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
