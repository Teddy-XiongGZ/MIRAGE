    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Increased collum angle refers to an increased angle between the neck and the head. This can be seen in conditions where the head is positioned more forward than normal. Class I bimaxillary protrusion refers to a condition where both the upper and lower jaws are protruded forward, but it does not necessarily involve an increased collum angle. Class II div 1 refers to a condition where the upper jaw is protruded forward and the lower jaw is retruded, which can result in an increased collum angle. Class II div 2 refers to a condition where the upper jaw is retruded and the lower jaw is protruded, which does not typically involve an increased collum angle. Class III refers to a condition where the lower jaw is protruded forward, which can also result in an increased collum angle. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Class II div 1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
