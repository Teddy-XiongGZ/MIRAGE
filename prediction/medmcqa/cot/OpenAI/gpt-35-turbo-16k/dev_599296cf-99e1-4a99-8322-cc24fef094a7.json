    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Rh-negative mother was given Anti-D during 28 weeks of pregnancy, which suggests that she has been sensitized to Rh-positive blood. The purpose of giving Anti-D is to prevent the mother from developing antibodies against Rh-positive blood. The Indirect Coombs Test (ICT) is used to detect the presence of these antibodies. If the ICT is negative, it means that the mother does not have antibodies against Rh-positive blood. However, since she has been sensitized to Rh-positive blood, there is still a risk of her developing antibodies in the future. Therefore, the ideal approach would be to give another dose of Anti-D 72 hours postpartum to further prevent the development of antibodies. The decision to give the additional dose should not depend on the baby's blood group, as the purpose is to prevent the mother from developing antibodies. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Give another dose of Anti-D 72 hours postpartum irrespective of baby blood group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
