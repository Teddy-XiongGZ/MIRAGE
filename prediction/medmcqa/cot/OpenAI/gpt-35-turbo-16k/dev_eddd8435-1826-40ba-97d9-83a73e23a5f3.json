    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the drug that does not belong to the amide group, we need to understand the classification of local anesthetics. Local anesthetics can be classified into two main groups: esters and amides. Esters include drugs like procaine, while amides include drugs like xylocaine, lignocaine, and bupivacaine. Therefore, we need to identify the drug that does not belong to the amide group. Comparing the options, we can see that Procaine is an ester, not an amide. Hence, the drug that does not belong to the amide group is Procaine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
