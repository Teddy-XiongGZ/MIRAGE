    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CRISPR Cas9 is a gene-editing tool that uses the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA (gRNA) to target specific sequences in the genome. The gRNA ensures that the Cas9 enzyme cuts at the right point in the genome, so option A is true. The Cas9 enzyme is indeed used in CRISPR gene editing, so option C is also true. NHEJ repair and HDR pathway are two mechanisms by which DNA can be repaired after the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA. Both of these pathways are involved in the DNA repair process, so option B is also true. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of these.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
