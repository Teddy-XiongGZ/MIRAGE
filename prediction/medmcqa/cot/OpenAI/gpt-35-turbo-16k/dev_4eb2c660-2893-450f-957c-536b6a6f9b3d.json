    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Feed forward mechanism refers to the body's response to a stimulus before the stimulus actually occurs. It is a predictive mechanism that prepares the body for an anticipated event. Let's analyze each option to determine which one is an example of a feed forward mechanism. A. Feeling thirsty while walking in hot temperature is not a feed forward mechanism because feeling thirsty is a response to the body's need for water after it has already become dehydrated. B. Shivering on exposure to cold temperature is not a feed forward mechanism either because shivering is a response to the body's attempt to generate heat after it has already become cold. C. Salivation on smelling food is a feed forward mechanism because the body anticipates the intake of food and prepares by increasing saliva production. D. Increase in blood pressure during supine posture is not a feed forward mechanism as it is a response to the change in body position rather than an anticipation of a future event. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Salivation on smelling food.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
