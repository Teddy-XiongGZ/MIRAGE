    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Supracondylar fracture of the humerus is a common fracture in children. It occurs just above the elbow joint and can lead to various complications. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Compartment syndrome: This is a possible complication of supracondylar fracture due to increased pressure within the forearm compartments. It can lead to neurovascular compromise and requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nB. Myositis ossificans: This is the formation of bone within the muscle tissue, which can occur as a result of trauma or injury. While it is a possible complication of supracondylar fracture, it is not specific to this type of fracture.\\n\\nC. Malunion: This refers to the improper healing of a fracture, resulting in a deformity or misalignment. It can occur in any fracture, including supracondylar fractures.\\n\\nD. Non-union: This refers to the failure of a fracture to heal. While it is possible for a supracondylar fracture to result in non-union, it is not a common complication.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the answer is B. Myositis ossificans, as it is not specific to supracondylar fractures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
