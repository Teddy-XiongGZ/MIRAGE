    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Wound healing is a complex process that involves various cellular and biochemical events. One important mineral that plays a crucial role in wound healing is copper. Copper is an essential trace mineral that is involved in the synthesis and stabilization of collagen, a key component of connective tissue. Collagen provides structural support to the wound and helps in the formation of new blood vessels. Copper also acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in the production of elastin, another important protein in wound healing. Additionally, copper has antimicrobial properties that help in preventing infection at the wound site. On the other hand, calcium is important for bone health and muscle contraction but does not directly contribute to wound healing. Selenium and magnesium are also essential minerals but do not have specific roles in wound healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Copper\"}"
