    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prolonged sodium channel inactivation refers to the delayed recovery of sodium channels from the inactivated state. This means that the sodium channels take longer to reset and become available for another action potential. The inactivation of sodium channels is important for the proper functioning of nerve conduction. If sodium channel inactivation is prolonged, it would result in a longer refractory period. During the refractory period, the neuron is unable to generate another action potential. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Decreased relative refractory period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
