    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The advantage of an ultra speed handpiece can be determined by considering the characteristics of low frequency and high amplitude versus high frequency and low amplitude. A. Low frequency and high amplitude make the patient comfortable: This statement is incorrect because low frequency and high amplitude can actually cause discomfort to the patient. B. High frequency and low amplitude do not let the patient perceive pain: This statement is incorrect because high frequency and low amplitude may still allow the patient to perceive pain. C. Less trauma: This statement is correct. The advantage of an ultra speed handpiece is that it can cause less trauma to the patient due to its high frequency and low amplitude. The high frequency allows for precise cutting and the low amplitude reduces the force applied to the tissues, resulting in less trauma. D. None of the above: This statement is incorrect because option C, 'Less trauma', is a valid advantage of an ultra speed handpiece.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
