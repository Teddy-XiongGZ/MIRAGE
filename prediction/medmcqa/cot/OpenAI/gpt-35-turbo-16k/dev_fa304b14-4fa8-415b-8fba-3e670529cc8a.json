    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Recurrent abortions and pain in calves can be indicative of a hypercoagulable state. One possible cause of a hypercoagulable state is a deficiency in one of the natural anticoagulant proteins. Protein C is one such anticoagulant protein that inhibits the coagulation cascade. Thrombin is an enzyme involved in the coagulation cascade and its deficiency would not lead to a hypercoagulable state. Plasmin is involved in fibrinolysis and its deficiency would not lead to a hypercoagulable state. Factor XIII is involved in stabilizing fibrin clots and its deficiency would not lead to a hypercoagulable state. Therefore, the most likely congenital deficiency in this patient is Protein C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
