    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mesiolingual developmental groove is a groove that is commonly seen on the lingual surface of certain teeth. To determine which tooth it is seen in, we need to consider the location of the groove. The term 'mesiolingual' indicates that the groove is located on the mesial (towards the midline) and lingual (towards the tongue) surface of the tooth. A. Maxillary 1st premolar: The mesiolingual developmental groove is not typically seen on the maxillary 1st premolar. B. Mandibular lateral incisor: The mesiolingual developmental groove is not typically seen on the mandibular lateral incisor. C. Maxillary lateral incisor: The mesiolingual developmental groove is not typically seen on the maxillary lateral incisor. D. Mandibular 1st premolar: The mesiolingual developmental groove is commonly seen on the mandibular 1st premolar. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Mandibular 1st premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
