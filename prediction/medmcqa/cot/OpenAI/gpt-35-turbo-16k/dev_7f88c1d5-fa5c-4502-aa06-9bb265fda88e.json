    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During forceps delivery in labor, facial nerve injury can occur due to various reasons. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Mastoid process is absent at birth: The absence of the mastoid process at birth is a normal anatomical variation and is not directly related to facial nerve injury during forceps delivery.\\n\\nB. Parotid gland in developing stage: The parotid gland is a salivary gland and its developmental stage is not directly related to facial nerve injury during forceps delivery.\\n\\nC. Beak of forceps engages main trunk of facial nerve: This is a possible cause of facial nerve injury during forceps delivery. If the beak of the forceps engages the main trunk of the facial nerve, it can lead to compression or stretching of the nerve, resulting in injury.\\n\\nD. Sublingual hematoma during delivery causes neuropraxia: Sublingual hematoma is not directly related to facial nerve injury during forceps delivery. Neuropraxia refers to a temporary loss of nerve function due to compression or stretching, but it is not specifically caused by sublingual hematoma.\\n\\nBased on the above evaluation, the most likely cause of facial nerve injury during forceps delivery is option C. Beak of forceps engages main trunk of facial Nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
