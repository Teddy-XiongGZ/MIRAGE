    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The burden of disease is a measure that takes into account both mortality (death) and morbidity (illness or disability). Therefore, the best index for burden of disease should consider both aspects. A. Case fatality rate only measures the proportion of deaths among individuals with a specific disease, but it does not take into account the morbidity aspect. B. Morbidity data provides information about the prevalence and incidence of diseases, but it does not directly measure the impact of the diseases on individuals' overall health and well-being. C. Dependency ratio is a measure of the number of dependents (usually children and elderly) compared to the working-age population. It is not a direct measure of burden of disease. D. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) is a comprehensive measure that combines both mortality and morbidity. It takes into account the years of life lost due to premature death and the years lived with disability. DALYs provide a more complete picture of the burden of disease and are widely used in public health research and policy-making. Therefore, the best index for burden of disease is D. Disability adjusted life years.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
