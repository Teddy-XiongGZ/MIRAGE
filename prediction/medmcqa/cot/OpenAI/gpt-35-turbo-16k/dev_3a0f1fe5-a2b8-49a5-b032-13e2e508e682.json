    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The glucose-oxidase peroxidase method is used to estimate blood glucose levels. If the patient has a normal blood glucose level as estimated by this method, it means that their blood glucose level is within the normal range. However, if the patient shows a positive Benedicts test in urine, it indicates the presence of reducing sugars in the urine. The most likely cause of this positive Benedicts test in the presence of normal blood glucose levels is fructosemia. Fructosemia is a condition where there is a deficiency of the enzyme fructokinase, leading to the accumulation of fructose in the blood and its excretion in the urine. This can result in a positive Benedicts test. Therefore, the answer is A. Fructosemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
