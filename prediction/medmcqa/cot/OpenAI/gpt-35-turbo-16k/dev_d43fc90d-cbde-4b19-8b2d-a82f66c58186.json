    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the good prognostic factors for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), we need to consider each option and evaluate its impact on the prognosis. Let's analyze each choice:\\n\\nA. Age of onset between 2-8 years: This is generally considered a good prognostic factor for ALL, as children in this age range tend to have a better response to treatment.\\n\\nB. Initial WBC count less than 50000: A lower white blood cell (WBC) count at the time of diagnosis is associated with a better prognosis in ALL.\\n\\nC. Hyperdiploidy: Hyperdiploidy, which refers to an abnormal increase in the number of chromosomes in the leukemia cells, is generally considered a favorable prognostic factor in ALL.\\n\\nD. t (9 : 22), t (8 : 14), t (4 : 11): These are chromosomal translocations that are associated with high-risk subtypes of ALL and are generally considered poor prognostic factors.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the option that is NOT a good prognostic factor for ALL is D. t (9 : 22), t (8 : 14), t (4 : 11).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
