    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Crescendo angina refers to a pattern of angina where the frequency, duration, and intensity of chest pain episodes progressively increase over a short period of time. This is typically a sign of worsening coronary artery disease and is often associated with the development of unstable angina. Stable angina, on the other hand, refers to chest pain that occurs predictably with exertion and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Heart failure and MI are not specific terms used to describe the pattern of angina, so they can be ruled out. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Unstable angina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
