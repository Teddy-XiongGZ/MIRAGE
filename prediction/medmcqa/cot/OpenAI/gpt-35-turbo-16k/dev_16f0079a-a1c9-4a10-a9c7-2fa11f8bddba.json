    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Swyer syndrome is a condition characterized by the presence of female external genitalia but with underdeveloped or absent ovaries. It is caused by a mutation in the SRY gene, which is responsible for the development of male gonads. As a result, individuals with Swyer syndrome have a 46,XY karyotype but do not develop testes. A. Can be feile with surrogacy: Surrogacy is not directly related to Swyer syndrome. Swyer syndrome is a genetic condition and is not typically associated with infertility due to the absence of functional ovaries. B. Can be feile with ovum donation: Ovum donation is not a treatment option for Swyer syndrome as the individuals with this condition do not have functional ovaries to produce eggs. C. Presents with primary feility: Swyer syndrome is associated with primary infertility as the individuals with this condition have underdeveloped or absent ovaries, which leads to a lack of ovulation and the inability to conceive naturally. D. Gonadectomy is indicated for all patients: Gonadectomy (removal of the gonads) is typically recommended for individuals with Swyer syndrome due to the increased risk of developing gonadal tumors. However, it is not indicated for all patients and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
