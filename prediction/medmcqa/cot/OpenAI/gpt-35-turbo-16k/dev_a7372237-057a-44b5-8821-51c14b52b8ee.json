    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During oral surgery, excessive bleeding can be decreased by minimizing blood flow to the surgical site. One way to achieve this is by positioning the patient in a way that reduces blood flow to the head and oral cavity. Let's evaluate the options: \\n\\nA. Head up: This position may increase blood flow to the head and oral cavity, potentially leading to increased bleeding. \\nB. Head down: This position may also increase blood flow to the head and oral cavity, potentially exacerbating bleeding. \\nC. Prone: This position refers to lying face down, which is unlikely to have any effect on blood flow to the head and oral cavity. \\nD. Supine: This position refers to lying flat on the back, which can help reduce blood flow to the head and oral cavity. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate position to decrease excessive bleeding during oral surgery is the supine position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
