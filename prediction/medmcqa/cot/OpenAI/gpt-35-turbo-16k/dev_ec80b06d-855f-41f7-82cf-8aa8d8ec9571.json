    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Group 2 sensory fibers are responsible for transmitting proprioceptive information, which includes information about muscle length, tension, and joint position. Annulospiral endings are specialized sensory receptors found in muscle spindles, which are responsible for detecting changes in muscle length. Golgi tendon organs are sensory receptors located in tendons, and they are responsible for detecting changes in muscle tension. Flower spray endings are sensory receptors found in joint capsules, and they are responsible for detecting changes in joint position. Pacinian corpuscles are specialized sensory receptors found in the skin, and they are responsible for detecting vibration and deep pressure. Since Group 2 sensory fibers are associated with proprioception, the correct answer is B. Golgi tendon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
