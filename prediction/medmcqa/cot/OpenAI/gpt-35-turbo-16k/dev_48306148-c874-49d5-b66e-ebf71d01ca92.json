    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The wrist joint is formed by the articulation of multiple bones. To determine which bones are involved in wrist joint formation, we need to identify the bones that make up the wrist joint. The wrist joint is a complex joint that involves multiple bones, including the scaphoid, ulna, radius, and triquetral. We need to identify the bone that is NOT involved in wrist joint formation. Let's go through the options: A. Scaphoid - The scaphoid bone is one of the carpal bones located in the wrist. It is involved in wrist joint formation. B. Ulna - The ulna is one of the two bones in the forearm. It is not directly involved in wrist joint formation. C. Radius - The radius is the other bone in the forearm. It is involved in wrist joint formation. D. Triquetral - The triquetral bone is one of the carpal bones located in the wrist. It is involved in wrist joint formation. Based on this analysis, the bone that is NOT involved in wrist joint formation is the ulna.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
