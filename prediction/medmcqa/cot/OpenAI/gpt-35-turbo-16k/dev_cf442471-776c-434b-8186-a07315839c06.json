    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Accessory canals are small channels that connect the pulp chamber with the periodontal ligament. They are commonly found in the apical third of the root. To determine the percentage of accessory canals found in the apical third of the root, we need to consider the total number of accessory canals and divide it by the total number of canals in the apical third. Unfortunately, the question does not provide any information about the total number of accessory canals or the total number of canals in the apical third. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact percentage of accessory canals found in the apical third of the root based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"N/A\"}"
