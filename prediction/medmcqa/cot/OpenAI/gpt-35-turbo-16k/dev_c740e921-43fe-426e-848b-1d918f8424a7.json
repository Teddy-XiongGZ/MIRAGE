    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tooth most frequently requiring root canal treatment (RCT) can be determined by considering the prevalence of dental caries and the anatomy of the tooth. 1. Dental caries: Dental caries, or tooth decay, is one of the main reasons for needing RCT. The prevalence of dental caries varies among different teeth. 2. Anatomy of the tooth: The anatomy of the tooth can also influence the likelihood of needing RCT. Teeth with more complex anatomy, such as multiple roots and canals, are more prone to infection and require RCT more frequently. Based on these factors, the answer can be determined as follows: A. Mandibular 1st molar: Mandibular 1st molars have a high prevalence of dental caries and often have multiple roots and canals, making them a common tooth requiring RCT. B. Maxillary 1st molar: Maxillary 1st molars also have a high prevalence of dental caries and complex anatomy, making them another common tooth requiring RCT. C. Mandibular 2nd premolar: Mandibular 2nd premolars have a lower prevalence of dental caries compared to molars. They usually have a single root and canal, which reduces the likelihood of needing RCT. D. Maxillary 2nd premolar: Maxillary 2nd premolars also have a lower prevalence of dental caries compared to molars. They usually have a single root and canal, which reduces the likelihood of needing RCT. Considering the factors mentioned above, the tooth most frequently requiring RCT is either A. Mandibular 1st molar or B. Maxillary 1st molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
