    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At 18 months of age, the child should receive a combination of vaccines to protect against various diseases. Let's go through the options one by one:\\n\\nA. DPT, OPV, and MMR: DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus), OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine), and MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) are all important vaccines, but they are usually given at different ages. MMR is typically given at 12-15 months of age, while DPT and OPV are usually given in multiple doses starting from 2 months of age. Therefore, this option is not appropriate for an 18-month-old child who has never been vaccinated before.\\n\\nB. Pentavalent vaccine alone: The pentavalent vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. It is usually given in multiple doses starting from 6 weeks of age. Since the child has never been vaccinated before, it is recommended to start with the first dose of the pentavalent vaccine and follow the appropriate schedule.\\n\\nC. BCG and OPV: BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine is given to protect against tuberculosis and is usually administered soon after birth. OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) is given in multiple doses starting from 2 months of age. Since the child is already 18 months old, it is not necessary to administer the BCG vaccine at this point. However, the child can receive the OPV vaccine as part of the routine immunization schedule.\\n\\nD. MMR, OPV, Rotavirus: As mentioned earlier, MMR is typically given at 12-15 months of age. OPV is given in multiple doses starting from 2 months of age. Rotavirus vaccine is usually given in multiple doses starting from 6 weeks of age. Therefore, this option is not appropriate for an 18-month-old child who has never been vaccinated before.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the most appropriate choice for the child would be option B. Pentavalent vaccine alone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
