    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"UV irradiation is a common method used to kill bacteria and viruses. To sensitize bacteria and viruses to UV irradiation, a component that is susceptible to UV damage is needed. Lipids, carbohydrates, and inorganic salts are not typically susceptible to UV damage. However, nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are known to be highly sensitive to UV irradiation. Therefore, the component that sensitizes bacteria and viruses to UV irradiation is nucleic acids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
