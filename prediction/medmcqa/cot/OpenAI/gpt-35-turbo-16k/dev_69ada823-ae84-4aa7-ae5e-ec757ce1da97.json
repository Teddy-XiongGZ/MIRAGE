    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The treatment for mandibular angle fracture depends on various factors such as the extent of the fracture, displacement of the fracture fragments, and the patient's overall condition. However, in general, the most appropriate treatment for mandibular angle fracture is to use 2 mini plates on the lateral surface of the mandible. This technique provides stability and allows for proper alignment and fixation of the fractured fragments. Compression plates may be used in certain cases where there is a need for additional compression at the fracture site. Reconstruction plates are typically used for more complex fractures involving multiple segments of the mandible. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option for mandibular angle fracture is B. 2 mini plates on the lateral surface of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
