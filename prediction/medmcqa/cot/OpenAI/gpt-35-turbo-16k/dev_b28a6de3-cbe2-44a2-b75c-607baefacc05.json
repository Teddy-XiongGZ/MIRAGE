    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a technique used to secure the airway in emergency situations. It involves the administration of an inducing agent and a neuromuscular relaxant together to rapidly induce unconsciousness and muscle relaxation. The patient is pre-oxygenated before the procedure to increase the oxygen reserve in the lungs. Cricoid pressure is applied during the procedure to prevent regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents. However, it is released once the endotracheal tube has been secured with a cuff. Thiopentone sodium and succinylcholine are commonly used drugs for induction and muscle relaxation in RSI. Based on this information, the answer choice that is not true about rapid sequence induction in a cardiac patient in an emergency is: C. Cricoid pressure has to be applied till the endotracheal tube has been secured with a cuff.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
