Troponins are a group of proteins that are specific to cardiac muscle. Troponin T, Troponin H, Troponin K, and Troponin M are different subunits of the troponin complex. Among these subunits, Troponin T is the most commonly used biomarker for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Troponin T.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
