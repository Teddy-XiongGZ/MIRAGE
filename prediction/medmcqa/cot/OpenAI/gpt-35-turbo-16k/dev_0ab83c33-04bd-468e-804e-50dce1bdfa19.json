    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 4 cm x 5 cm lump in the right neck, which is confirmed to be a squamous cell carcinoma. The clinical assessment of the oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx did not reveal any tumor. The whole-body PET scan did not show any increased uptake except for the neck mass. Based on this information, the tumor is classified as an unknown primary. According to the AJCC system of classification, the TNM status of the tumor would be determined as follows: T - Since the primary tumor is unknown, it would be classified as Tx. N - The presence of a neck mass indicates regional lymph node involvement, specifically N2. M - The whole-body PET scan did not show any distant metastasis, indicating M0. Therefore, the TNM status of the tumor would be TxN2M0.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. TxN2aMx\"}"
