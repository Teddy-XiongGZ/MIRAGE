    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Contraction of visual field is a known side effect of certain anticonvulsant medications. To determine which anticonvulsant causes this side effect, we need to review the side effect profiles of each option. \\n\\nA. Levetiracetam: Levetiracetam is not known to cause contraction of visual field. \\n\\nB. Phenytoin: Phenytoin is associated with a variety of visual disturbances, including diplopia (double vision), nystagmus (involuntary eye movement), and blurred vision, but not specifically contraction of visual field. \\n\\nC. Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin is known to cause contraction of visual field, also known as concentric visual field defects. This side effect is related to the drug's mechanism of action, which involves increasing levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. \\n\\nD. Ethosuximide: Ethosuximide is primarily used to treat absence seizures and is not associated with contraction of visual field. \\n\\nBased on this information, the anticonvulsant that causes contraction of visual field is C. Vigabatrin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
