Means: This option refers to the average values of a set of data and does not specifically address the statistical test for determining significance. C. Ratio: This option refers to the comparison of two quantities and is not directly related to the statistical test for determining significance. D. Normalcy: This option refers to the state of being normal or conforming to a standard, and does not specifically address the statistical test for determining significance. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is A. Tests of significance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
