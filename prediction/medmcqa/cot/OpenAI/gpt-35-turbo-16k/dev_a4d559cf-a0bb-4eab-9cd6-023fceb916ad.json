    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a concentration of platelets derived from the patient's own blood. It contains various growth factors that promote tissue healing and regeneration. To determine which growth factor is not present in PRP, we need to understand the composition of PRP and the growth factors it typically contains. PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor) is one of the growth factors found in PRP. PDGF exists in different isoforms, including PDGF aa, PDGF bb, and PDGF cc. PDGF Fab, on the other hand, is not a known isoform of PDGF. Therefore, the growth factor that is not present in PRP is PDGF Fab.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
