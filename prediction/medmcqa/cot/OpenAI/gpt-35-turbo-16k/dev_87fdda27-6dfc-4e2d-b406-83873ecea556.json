    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In hemophilia B, there is a deficiency of factor IX, which is necessary for blood clotting. Therefore, factor replacement therapy is required to prevent bleeding during surgery. The appropriate rate of factor replacement depends on the severity of the surgery and the patient's individual needs. In major surgeries, a higher dose of factor replacement is typically required. The recommended dose for major surgeries in hemophilia B patients is 80-100 units/kg. The frequency of administration depends on the half-life of the factor IX concentrate being used. The half-life of factor IX is approximately 18-24 hours. Therefore, the factor replacement should be given every 12 hours to maintain adequate levels of factor IX in the blood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
