    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the technique of root coverage, we need to consider the different options provided. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Langer and langer technique: This technique is commonly used for root coverage and involves the use of a connective tissue graft.\\n\\nB. Pouch and tunnel technique: This technique is also used for root coverage and involves creating a pouch or tunnel in the soft tissue to cover the exposed root.\\n\\nC. Azis technique: This technique is not commonly known in the field of root coverage.\\n\\nD. Bruno technique: This technique is not commonly known in the field of root coverage.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, it appears that the most appropriate answer is either A. Langer and langer technique or B. Pouch and tunnel technique. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact technique. Therefore, the answer choice is either A or B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
