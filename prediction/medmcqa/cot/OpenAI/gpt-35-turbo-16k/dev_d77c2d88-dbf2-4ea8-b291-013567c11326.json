    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluoride is a mineral that can be found in various sources. To determine which option has the maximum fluoride content, we need to consider the natural sources of fluoride. Sea fish are known to accumulate fluoride from the water they live in, so they could potentially have a high fluoride content. Tea leaves are also known to contain fluoride, as they absorb it from the soil. Human milk is not typically a significant source of fluoride, as the fluoride content in breast milk is generally low. Coconut water is not known to be a significant source of fluoride either. Based on this information, the option with the highest likelihood of having the maximum fluoride content is A. Sea fish.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
