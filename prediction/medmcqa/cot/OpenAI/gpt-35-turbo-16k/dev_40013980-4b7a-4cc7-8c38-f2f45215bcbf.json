    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are both types of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. In CLL/SLL, the tumor cells are derived from B cells. To determine the specific type of B cell from which the tumor cells arise, we need to consider the characteristics of CLL/SLL. CLL/SLL is characterized by the accumulation of mature-looking lymphocytes that express B-cell markers. These cells are typically CD5-positive and CD23-positive. Given these characteristics, the most likely origin of the tumor cells in CLL/SLL is a mature B cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
