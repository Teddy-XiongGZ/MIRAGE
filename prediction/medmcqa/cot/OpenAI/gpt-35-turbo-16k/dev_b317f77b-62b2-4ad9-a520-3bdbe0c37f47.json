To determine the answer to this question, we need to understand what constitutes an aggravated sexual offence under POCSO.

Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Gang Rape: Gang rape involves multiple perpetrators, which is an aggravating factor. Therefore, it can be considered an aggravated sexual offence.\\n\\nB. Rape by threatening: Rape by threatening involves the use of threats, which is an aggravating factor. Therefore, it can be considered an aggravated sexual offence.\\n\\nC. Rape by police officer: Rape by a police officer involves the commission of the offence by a person in authority, which is an aggravating factor. Therefore, it can be considered an aggravated sexual offence.\\n\\nD. Rape during communal violence: Rape during communal violence does not involve any of the aggravating factors mentioned above. Therefore, it can be considered a regular sexual offence, not an aggravated one.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the answer is D. Rape during communal violence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
