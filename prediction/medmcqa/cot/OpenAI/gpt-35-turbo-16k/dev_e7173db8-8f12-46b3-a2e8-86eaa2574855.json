    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of a short PR interval and delta wave on ECG suggests the possibility of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, which is a congenital condition characterized by an accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles. In WPW syndrome, the accessory pathway can conduct electrical impulses faster than the normal pathway, leading to a shortened PR interval and a characteristic delta wave on ECG. The main concern with WPW syndrome is the risk of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial fibrillation, which can be life-threatening. The most effective treatment for WPW syndrome is catheter ablation, which eliminates the accessory pathway. However, in this case, the question asks for the least effective measure. A. Holter monitoring: Holter monitoring is a useful tool for detecting and monitoring arrhythmias over a 24 to 48-hour period. However, in this case, the boy is asymptomatic, and the presence of a short PR interval and delta wave on ECG already suggests the diagnosis of WPW syndrome. Holter monitoring may not provide additional information or change the management plan. B. Treadmill stress test: A treadmill stress test is commonly used to evaluate exercise-induced arrhythmias and ischemia. However, in this case, the boy is asymptomatic, and the presence of a short PR interval and delta wave on ECG already suggests the diagnosis of WPW syndrome. A stress test may not provide additional information or change the management plan. C. Beta blocker: Beta blockers are commonly used to manage symptoms and prevent arrhythmias in patients with WPW syndrome. However, in this case, the boy is asymptomatic, and the question asks for the least effective measure. Beta blockers may not be necessary if the patient is not experiencing symptoms or arrhythmias. D. Reassurance: Reassurance may be appropriate in some cases, especially if the patient is asymptomatic and has a low-risk profile. However, in this case, the presence of a short PR interval and delta wave on ECG suggests the diagnosis of WPW syndrome, which carries a risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Reassurance alone may not be sufficient and active management may be required. Based on the above considerations, the least effective measure for the boy would be reassurance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
