    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Porcelain is a type of ceramic material that is composed mainly of clay, feldspar, and silica. It is known for its strength, durability, and translucency. To determine which component is not present in porcelain, we need to consider the composition of porcelain. Silica is a key component of porcelain, as it provides strength and hardness. Feldspar is also present in porcelain, as it helps to lower the melting point and improve the workability of the material. Calcium carbonate is not typically present in porcelain, as it is not necessary for its formation.
