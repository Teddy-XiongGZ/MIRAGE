    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intrafusal fibers are specialized muscle fibers found within muscle spindles. They are responsible for detecting changes in muscle length and tension. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Nuclear bag fibers are lesser: This statement is incorrect. Nuclear bag fibers are one type of intrafusal fiber and are present in muscle spindles.\\n\\nB. Nuclear chain fibers are shorter and thinner: This statement is correct. Nuclear chain fibers are another type of intrafusal fiber and are indeed shorter and thinner compared to nuclear bag fibers.\\n\\nC. Secondary endings excited by chain fibers only: This statement is incorrect. Both nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers have secondary endings that are excited by the stretch of the muscle spindle.\\n\\nD. Primary endings excited by bag fibers only: This statement is incorrect. Both nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers have primary endings that are excited by the rate of change in muscle length.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. Nuclear chain fibers are shorter and thinner.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
