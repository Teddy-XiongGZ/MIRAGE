    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells. To determine its target, we need to understand the stages of red blood cell development. The process starts with hematopoietic stem cells, which differentiate into common myeloid progenitors. These progenitors then give rise to burst forming units (BFU), which further differentiate into colony forming units (CFU). CFUs then differentiate into late erythroblasts, which eventually mature into normoblasts. Given this information, we can conclude that erythropoietin acts on the early stages of red blood cell development, specifically on the burst forming unit (BFU).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
