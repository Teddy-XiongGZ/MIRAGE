    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sibilant sounds are a type of consonant sounds that are produced with a high-pitched, hissing or whistling sound. These sounds are typically produced by a narrow constriction in the vocal tract. To determine where sibilant sounds are produced, we need to consider the different positions of the vocal tract during speech production. A. Rest position: This refers to the position of the vocal tract when it is at rest, without any constriction or movement. Sibilant sounds are not produced at rest position. B. Occluding position: This refers to the position of the vocal tract when there is a complete closure or blockage, such as when producing stops or plosive sounds. Sibilant sounds are not produced at occluding position. C. Open from resting position: This refers to the position of the vocal tract when it transitions from the rest position to a more open position, such as when producing vowels or approximant sounds. Sibilant sounds are not produced when transitioning from the rest position to an open position. D. Between rest and occluding position: This refers to the position of the vocal tract when it is in the process of transitioning from the rest position to an occluding position. Sibilant sounds are produced at this position, as the narrowing of the vocal tract creates the high-pitched, hissing or whistling sound characteristic of sibilant sounds. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Between rest and occluding position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
