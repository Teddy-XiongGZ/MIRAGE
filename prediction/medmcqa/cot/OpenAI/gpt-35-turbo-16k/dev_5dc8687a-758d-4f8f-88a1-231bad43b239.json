    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Compressive strength refers to the ability of a material to withstand compressive forces without breaking or deforming. Tensile strength, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a material to withstand stretching or pulling forces without breaking. If a material has high compressive strength and low tensile strength, it means that it can withstand compressive forces well but is prone to breaking or deforming under stretching or pulling forces. Based on this information, the material can be classified as brittle. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Brittleness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
