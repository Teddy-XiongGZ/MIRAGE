    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Idiopathic cholestasis is a condition characterized by impaired bile flow, resulting in the accumulation of bile acids in the liver. This condition commonly occurs during pregnancy and is associated with pruritus (itching) and elevated liver enzymes. The features of idiopathic cholestasis include elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, elevated SGPT (also known as ALT), and prolongation of prothrombin time. However, a serum bilirubin level of 2 mg/dl is within the normal range and would not be expected to be elevated in idiopathic cholestasis. Therefore, the answer choice that is likely to be incorrect is A. Serum bilirubin of 2 mg/dl.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
