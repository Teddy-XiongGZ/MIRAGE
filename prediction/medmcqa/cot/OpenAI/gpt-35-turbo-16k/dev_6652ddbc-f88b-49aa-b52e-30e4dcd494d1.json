    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tooth is known as an enigma to endodontists, we need to consider the characteristics and challenges associated with each tooth. A. Mandibular canine: While mandibular canines can present some challenges in endodontic treatment due to their curved roots, they are not typically considered enigmatic. B. Maxillary 1st premolar: Maxillary 1st premolars can have complex root canal anatomy, with multiple canals and variations in canal morphology. This can make them challenging to treat, but they are not commonly referred to as enigmatic. C. Mandibular 2nd premolar: Mandibular 2nd premolars are often considered the enigma to endodontists. They have a high incidence of anatomical variations, such as extra canals, C-shaped canals, and accessory canals. These variations can make it difficult to locate and thoroughly clean the entire root canal system. D. Mandibular 1st premolar: Mandibular 1st premolars can also have anatomical variations, but they are not typically considered as enigmatic as the mandibular 2nd premolars. Based on this information, the tooth known as an enigma to endodontists is the Mandibular 2nd premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
