    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pulpal injury progression, the main cause of pain is typically related to the activation of nerve fibers. When the pulp tissue is injured, it releases inflammatory mediators that can sensitize the nerve fibers, leading to a decreased threshold for pain. This means that even mild stimuli can cause pain. Increased vascular permeability and arteriolar dilatation may contribute to the inflammatory response, but they are not the main cause of pain. Decreased pressure is not typically associated with pain during pulpal injury progression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
