    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Odontogenic cysts are cysts that form in the jawbone or the soft tissues of the mouth. The most frequently indicated surgical procedure for odontogenic cysts is enucleation. Enucleation involves the complete removal of the cystic lesion, including the cystic lining. Incision and drainage is typically performed for abscesses, not cysts. Sclerosing solution is used for the treatment of certain types of cysts, such as radicular cysts, but it is not the most frequently indicated procedure for odontogenic cysts. Marsupialisation is a technique used to decompress large cysts and promote healing, but it is not the most frequently indicated procedure for odontogenic cysts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
