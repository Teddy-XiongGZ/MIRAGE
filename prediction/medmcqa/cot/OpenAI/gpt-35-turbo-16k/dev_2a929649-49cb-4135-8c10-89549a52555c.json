    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sickle cell mutation is a genetic mutation that affects the shape of red blood cells. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Point mutation: This type of mutation involves a change in a single nucleotide base pair. It can lead to the substitution of one amino acid in the protein sequence. Sickle cell mutation is indeed a point mutation because it involves a single nucleotide change in the beta-globin gene.\\n\\nB. Selective mutation: This term refers to a mutation that is advantageous for an organism's survival and is therefore selected for in the population. Sickle cell mutation is not a selective mutation because it causes a disease and is not advantageous.\\n\\nC. Frame shift mutation: This type of mutation involves the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, causing a shift in the reading frame of the gene. Sickle cell mutation is not a frame shift mutation because it does not involve the insertion or deletion of nucleotides.\\n\\nD. Nonsense mutation: This type of mutation leads to the premature termination of protein synthesis. Sickle cell mutation is not a nonsense mutation because it does not result in a premature stop codon.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Point mutation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
