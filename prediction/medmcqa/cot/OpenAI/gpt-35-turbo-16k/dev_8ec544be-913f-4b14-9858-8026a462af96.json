    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this case, the patient is admitted with septic abortion and tricuspid valve endocarditis. Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, which can lead to the formation of vegetations. These vegetations are typically composed of fibrin, platelets, and bacteria. In the context of tricuspid valve endocarditis, the vegetation is most likely to affect the lungs. The tricuspid valve is located on the right side of the heart and is responsible for regulating blood flow between the right atrium and right ventricle. When the tricuspid valve is infected, the vegetations can break off and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism or septic pulmonary infarcts. Therefore, the answer choice is D. Lung.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
