    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In Dummer's classification, Type 1 refers to a single canal with a single apical foramen, Type 2 refers to a single canal with multiple apical foramina, Type 3 refers to multiple canals with a single apical foramen, and Type 4 refers to multiple canals with multiple apical foramina. Since the question mentions 'multi constricted apical constriction', it suggests that there are multiple constrictions at the apical region. This is consistent with Type 4 in Dummer's classification, where there are multiple canals with multiple apical foramina. Therefore, the answer is D. Type 4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
