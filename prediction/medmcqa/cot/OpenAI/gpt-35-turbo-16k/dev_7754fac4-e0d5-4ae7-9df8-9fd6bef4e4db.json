    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that occur in a population over a specific period of time. It is a measure of the risk of developing a disease. Now let's evaluate each statement: A. Incidence decreases when a programme is effective - This statement is true. When a program is effective in preventing or controlling a disease, the number of new cases (incidence) will decrease. B. Vaccination strategies decrease the incidence of a disease - This statement is also true. Vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent the occurrence of certain diseases, thus reducing the incidence. C. Newer and effective treatment modalities decrease the incidence - This statement is not true. Treatment modalities aim to manage or cure existing cases of a disease, but they do not directly impact the incidence. Incidence is a measure of new cases, not existing cases. D. Incidence implies the number of new cases detected over a fixed time - This statement is true. Incidence is calculated by dividing the number of new cases by the population at risk over a specific time period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
