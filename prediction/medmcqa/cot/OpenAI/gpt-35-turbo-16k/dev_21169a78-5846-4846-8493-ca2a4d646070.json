    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The coefficient of friction is a measure of the resistance to sliding between two surfaces. It depends on various factors including the materials in contact. To determine which alloy has the highest coefficient of friction, we need to consider the properties of each alloy. SS refers to stainless steel, TMA refers to titanium-molybdenum alloy, Ni-Ti refers to nickel-titanium alloy, and Elgiloy is a cobalt-chromium-nickel alloy. Without specific information about the composition and surface properties of each alloy, it is difficult to determine which one has the highest coefficient of friction. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
