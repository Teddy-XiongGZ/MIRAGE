    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The law of pulse oximetry is based on the principle of light absorption by hemoglobin. Pulse oximetry measures the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the blood by shining light through a pulsating capillary bed and measuring the amount of light absorbed. The correct answer is D. Beer Lambert's law, which states that the absorbance of a substance is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species and the path length of the light through the substance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
