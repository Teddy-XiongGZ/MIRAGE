    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Obturation with gutta-percha cones is indicated in primary teeth only when the canals are very long but straight. This is because gutta-percha cones are used to fill and seal the root canal space, and they are most effective in long, straight canals. If the canals are too wide, other materials such as resins or pastes may be used. The presence or absence of a successor tooth or the recommendation for a stainless steel crown does not directly affect the indication for obturation with gutta-percha cones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
