    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase is responsible for the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, which is necessary for the breakdown of glycogen. However, this enzyme is not present in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes where glycogenesis occurs. Instead, glucose-6-phosphatase is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, option B is correct. The glucose-6-phosphate synthesized during glycogenesis in the cytoplasm cannot be immediately degraded because the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase is not present in the cytoplasm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
