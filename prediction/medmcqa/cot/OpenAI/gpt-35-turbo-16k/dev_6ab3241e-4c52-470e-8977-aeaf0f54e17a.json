    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Obstructive jaundice is a condition characterized by the obstruction of the bile ducts, which leads to impaired flow of bile from the liver to the intestines. This obstruction can be caused by various factors, including tumors, gallstones, or strictures. In obstructive jaundice, the bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced by the breakdown of red blood cells, cannot be properly excreted and accumulates in the blood. A bilirubin level of 40 mg/dL is significantly elevated and indicates severe jaundice. Given this information, the most likely explanation for a bilirubin level of 40 mg/dL in a patient with obstructive jaundice would be a complete obstruction of the common bile duct (Choice B). This complete obstruction prevents any bile from reaching the intestines, leading to a significant increase in bilirubin levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
