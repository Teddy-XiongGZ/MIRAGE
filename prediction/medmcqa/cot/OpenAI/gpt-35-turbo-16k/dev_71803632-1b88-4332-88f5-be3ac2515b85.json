    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital cataract is a condition where a person is born with clouding of the lens in one or both eyes. It can be caused by various genetic mutations. To determine the gene commonly indicated in congenital cataract, we need to consider the known genes associated with this condition. A. PAX-6: PAX-6 is a gene that plays a crucial role in eye development. Mutations in this gene can lead to various eye abnormalities, including congenital cataract. B. CRYGS-3: CRYGS-3 is a specific isoform of the crystallin gamma S gene. Mutations in this gene have been associated with congenital cataract, but it is not commonly indicated compared to other genes. C. LMX-IB: LMX-IB is a gene involved in limb development. It is not commonly associated with congenital cataract. D. PITX-3: PITX-3 is a gene that plays a role in eye development. Mutations in this gene have been found to cause congenital cataract. Based on the information provided, the gene commonly indicated in congenital cataract is PAX-6. Therefore, the correct answer is A. PAX-6.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
