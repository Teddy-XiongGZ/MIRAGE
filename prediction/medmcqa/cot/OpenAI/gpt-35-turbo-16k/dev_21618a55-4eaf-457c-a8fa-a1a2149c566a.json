    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To increase the birth weight of a baby, we need to consider factors that promote healthy fetal growth. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Cessation of smoking: Smoking during pregnancy is known to restrict fetal growth and can lead to low birth weight. Therefore, quitting smoking can potentially increase the birth weight of a baby.\\n\\nB. Aspirin: Aspirin is not typically recommended during pregnancy as it may increase the risk of bleeding and other complications. It does not directly contribute to increasing birth weight.\\n\\nC. Ca++ and vitamin D supplement: Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important for fetal development. These nutrients support healthy bone growth and can potentially contribute to increased birth weight.\\n\\nD. Bed rest: Bed rest is generally recommended for specific medical conditions during pregnancy, but it does not directly impact birth weight.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, options A and C are potential ways to increase the birth weight of a baby.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A and C\"}"
