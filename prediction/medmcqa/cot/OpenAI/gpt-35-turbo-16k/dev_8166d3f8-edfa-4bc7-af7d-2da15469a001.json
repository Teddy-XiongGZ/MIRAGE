    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The retrocuspid papilla is a small, rounded elevation of tissue found on the lingual aspect of the attached gingiva. It is located approximately 1mm below the free gingiva. To determine its location, we need to consider the position of the retrocuspid papilla in relation to the teeth. The term 'retrocuspid' suggests that it is located behind a cuspid tooth. Cuspid teeth are also known as canines. Therefore, the retrocuspid papilla is found lingual to a cuspid tooth. Now, we need to determine whether it is a mandibular or maxillary cuspid tooth. The term 'lingual' indicates that it is on the tongue side of the tooth. In dental anatomy, the term 'lingual' is used for the mandibular arch, while 'palatal' is used for the maxillary arch. Therefore, the retrocuspid papilla is found lingual to a mandibular cuspid tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Mandibular canine.\"}"
