    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the maximum penetration among the given options, we need to consider the properties of each type of ray. \\n\\nA. Alpha particles are positively charged and relatively large, so they have low penetration power and can be stopped by a few centimeters of air or a sheet of paper. \\n\\nB. Beta particles are negatively charged and smaller than alpha particles. They have higher penetration power than alpha particles and can penetrate a few millimeters of aluminum or several centimeters of air. \\n\\nC. Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves and have the highest penetration power among the given options. They can penetrate several centimeters of lead or several meters of concrete. \\n\\nD. Electron beams are streams of high-energy electrons and have moderate penetration power, similar to beta particles. \\n\\nBased on these properties, the ray with the maximum penetration is C. Gamma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
