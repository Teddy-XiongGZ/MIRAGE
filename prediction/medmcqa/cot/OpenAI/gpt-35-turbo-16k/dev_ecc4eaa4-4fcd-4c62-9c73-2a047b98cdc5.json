    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The decayed mandibular 1st molar involves the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps. Based on the extent of the decay, the restoration of choice should provide sufficient strength and durability. A. Intermediate restoration: An intermediate restoration is a temporary filling used when a permanent restoration cannot be immediately placed. It is not the ideal choice for a decayed molar involving cusps. B. Composite: Composite resin is a tooth-colored filling material that can be used for small to moderate restorations. However, for a decayed molar involving cusps, composite may not provide enough strength and durability. C. Cast metal: Cast metal restorations, such as gold or metal alloys, are known for their strength and durability. They are often used for large restorations involving cusps, making them a suitable choice for this case. D. GIC: Glass ionomer cement (GIC) is a dental material that releases fluoride and has good adhesion to tooth structure. While it can be used for small to moderate restorations, it may not provide enough strength for a decayed molar involving cusps. Based on the above considerations, the restoration of choice for a decayed mandibular 1st molar involving the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps would be C. Cast metal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
