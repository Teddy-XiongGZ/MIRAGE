    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Patellar clunk syndrome is a condition where there is interposition of soft tissue or a hypertrophied scar between the patellar component and the femoral component of a total knee replacement. This causes a clunking or clicking sensation during knee movement. To determine the location of the interposed tissue, we need to consider the position of the patella and the direction of movement. During flexion, the patella moves superiorly, and during extension, it moves inferiorly. Therefore, the interposed tissue would be located at the superior pole of the patella and impinging on the femoral component during flexion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
