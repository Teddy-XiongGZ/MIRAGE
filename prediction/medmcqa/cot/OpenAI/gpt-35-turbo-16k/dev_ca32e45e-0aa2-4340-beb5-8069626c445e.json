    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When performing tooth preparation in a vital tooth, it is important to isolate the tooth to prevent contamination from saliva and to provide a dry working field. The most appropriate method of isolation in this case is the use of a rubber dam. A rubber dam is a thin sheet of latex or non-latex material that is placed over the tooth to isolate it from the oral environment. It is secured around the tooth with a clamp and provides excellent isolation by preventing saliva and other contaminants from reaching the tooth. Cotton rolls can be used to help with isolation, but they are not as effective as a rubber dam. A salivary ejector is used to remove saliva and other fluids from the mouth, but it does not provide adequate isolation. Svedopter is not a recognized method of isolation in dentistry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Isolation with rubber dam\"}"
