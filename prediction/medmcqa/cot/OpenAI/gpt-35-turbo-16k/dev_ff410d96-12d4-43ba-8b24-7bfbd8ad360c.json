    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body. They do this by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. Activation energy is the energy needed to start a chemical reaction. By lowering the activation energy, enzymes make it easier for the reaction to happen, thus increasing the rate of the reaction. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Lowering the activation energy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
