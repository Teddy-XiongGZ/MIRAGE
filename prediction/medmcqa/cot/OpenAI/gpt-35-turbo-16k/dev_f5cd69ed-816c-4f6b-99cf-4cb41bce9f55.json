    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to assess the patient's condition based on the provided information. The patient is a 50-year-old male with high blood pressure (160/100 mm Hg) and a high heart rate (120/min). The next step is to analyze the CECT (contrast-enhanced computed tomography) scan. However, since the CECT scan is not provided, we cannot evaluate it. Therefore, we need to rely on the given information to determine the best management option. Given the patient's high blood pressure and heart rate, the most appropriate management option would be to control the blood pressure and heart rate. Among the provided choices, the best option for this would be a beta blocker. Beta blockers are commonly used to lower blood pressure and heart rate by blocking the effects of adrenaline on the heart. Surgical repair, LMW heparin, and vitamin K inhibitors are not appropriate management options for high blood pressure and heart rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Beta blocker\"}"
