    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dental lamina is a structure that gives rise to the primary teeth. To determine what initiates its formation, we need to consider the development of teeth. Teeth develop from the interaction between the oral epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme. The oral epithelium is derived from the ectoderm, while the mesenchyme is derived from the neural crest cells. The dental lamina is formed from the oral epithelium. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Neural crest cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
