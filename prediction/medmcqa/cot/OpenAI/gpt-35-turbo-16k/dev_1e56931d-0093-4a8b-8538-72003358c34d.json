    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a road traffic accident, if a motorcyclist has raised arterial pCO2 on ABG, it indicates a problem with ventilation. The respiratory apparatus includes the lungs, airways, and chest wall, while the respiratory center is located in the brainstem. To determine the probable cause, we need to consider the possible injuries that could affect either the respiratory apparatus or the respiratory center. Option A: Damage to respiratory apparatus - If there is damage to the lungs, airways, or chest wall, it can lead to impaired ventilation and increased pCO2. This is a possible cause. Option B: Damage to respiratory center - If there is damage to the brainstem, specifically the respiratory center, it can disrupt the control of breathing and result in inadequate ventilation. This is also a possible cause. Option C: Damage to both respiratory apparatus and respiratory center - If both the respiratory apparatus and the respiratory center are damaged, it would further compromise ventilation and increase pCO2. This is a possible cause. Option D: Massive lung contusion alone - While lung contusion can impair gas exchange and ventilation, it alone may not be sufficient to cause significantly raised pCO2 on ABG. Considering the above possibilities, the most probable cause for the raised arterial pCO2 on ABG in a motorcyclist after a road traffic accident would be option C: Damage to both respiratory apparatus and respiratory center.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
