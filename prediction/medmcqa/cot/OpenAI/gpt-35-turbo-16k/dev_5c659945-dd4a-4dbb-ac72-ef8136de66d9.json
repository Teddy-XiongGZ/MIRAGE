    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the number of phases in the step back technique, we need to understand what the technique involves. The step back technique is a method used in endodontics (root canal treatment) to prepare the root canal space. It involves using progressively larger files to remove infected or damaged tissue from the root canal. The files are used in a sequential manner, starting with a smaller file and gradually increasing the size. Typically, the step back technique involves two phases. In the first phase, the initial file is used to create a glide path and remove any obstructions in the canal. This is done by gently rotating the file in a clockwise direction while applying a light apical pressure. In the second phase, larger files are used to gradually enlarge the canal and remove the infected or damaged tissue. These files are also rotated in a clockwise direction while applying apical pressure. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. 2 phases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
