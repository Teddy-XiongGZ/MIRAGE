    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi tendon organ is a sensory receptor located in the tendons of skeletal muscles. It is responsible for detecting changes in muscle tension. When the muscle contracts and generates tension, the Golgi tendon organ is activated and sends signals to the central nervous system. This helps regulate muscle contraction and prevent excessive force or damage to the muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Muscle Tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
