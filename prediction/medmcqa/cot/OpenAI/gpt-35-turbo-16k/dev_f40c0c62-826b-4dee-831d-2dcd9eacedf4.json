    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bifurcated root refers to a tooth root that is divided into two separate branches. To determine which tooth has the highest incidence of bifurcated root, we need to consider the anatomy of each tooth. Mandibular canines typically have a single root, so they are unlikely to have a bifurcated root. Mandibular central incisors also usually have a single root. Mandibular lateral incisors can sometimes have two roots, but the incidence of bifurcated roots in this tooth is not as high as in other teeth. Maxillary canines, on the other hand, commonly have a bifurcated root. Therefore, the tooth with the highest incidence of bifurcated root is likely the maxillary canine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
