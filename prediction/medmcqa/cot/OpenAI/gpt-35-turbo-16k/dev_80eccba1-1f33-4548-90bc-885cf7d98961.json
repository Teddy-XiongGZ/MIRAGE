    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RIFLE and KDIGO criteria are both used to assess kidney function and differentiate tubular injury. RIFLE criteria stands for Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease, while KDIGO criteria stands for Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. Both criteria consider various parameters to evaluate kidney function. To differentiate tubular injury, we need to look for specific markers that indicate tubular damage. Urinary NGAL (Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin) is a marker that is elevated in tubular injury. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Urinary NGAL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
