    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontal fibers are connective tissue fibers that attach the tooth to the surrounding alveolar bone. They provide support and stability to the tooth. When the alveolar bone is destroyed, some periodontal fibers may be lost or damaged. However, there are certain periodontal fibers that are consistent and can be reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. The apical fibers (A) are located at the apex of the tooth and are responsible for anchoring the tooth to the bone. These fibers are not consistent and are usually lost when the alveolar bone is destroyed. The alveolar crest group (B) consists of fibers that run from the alveolar crest to the cementum of the tooth. These fibers are consistent and can be reconstructed even after the destruction of the alveolar bone. They play a crucial role in maintaining the position of the tooth in the socket. The oblique fibers (C) are located in the middle third of the root and run obliquely from the cementum to the alveolar bone. These fibers are not consistent and are usually lost when the alveolar bone is destroyed. The transseptal fibers (D) are located in the interdental septum and run horizontally from one tooth to another. These fibers are not consistent and are usually lost when the alveolar bone is destroyed. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Alveolar crest group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
