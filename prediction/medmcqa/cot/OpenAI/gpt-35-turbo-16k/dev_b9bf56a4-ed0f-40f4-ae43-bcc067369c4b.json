    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When an orthodontic wire is permanently bent during its clinical application, it undergoes plastic deformation. This plastic deformation causes the alloy to work harden, which means that its strength increases while its ductility decreases. Work hardening also leads to the development of internal stresses within the wire. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
