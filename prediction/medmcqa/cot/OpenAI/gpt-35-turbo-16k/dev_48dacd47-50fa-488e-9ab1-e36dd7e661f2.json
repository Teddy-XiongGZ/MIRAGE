    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step should be to check for supernumerary teeth. Supernumerary teeth are extra teeth that can disrupt the normal alignment of the teeth. If there are supernumerary teeth present, they may need to be removed or managed before addressing the rotated maxillary central incisor. If there are no supernumerary teeth, then the next step would be to exert a couple on the tooth. A couple is a force that is applied to rotate the tooth back into its correct position. If this is not successful, then fixed orthodontic appliances may be considered. Resection of supracrestal fibers is not typically indicated for a rotated tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
