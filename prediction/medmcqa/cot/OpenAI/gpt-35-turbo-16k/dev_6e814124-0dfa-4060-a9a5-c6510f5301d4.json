    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To assess the risk of Down's syndrome in the present pregnancy, there are several options available. Let's evaluate each choice one by one:\\n\\nA. Maternal alpha-feto protein (AFP): AFP is a marker used to screen for neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, but it is not specific for Down's syndrome. Therefore, it is not the best choice for assessing the risk of Down's syndrome.\\n\\nB. Maternal HCG: HCG is a hormone produced during pregnancy, but it is not specific for Down's syndrome. Therefore, it is not the best choice for assessing the risk of Down's syndrome.\\n\\nC. USG (ultrasound): Ultrasound can be used to measure certain markers, such as nuchal translucency, which can indicate an increased risk of Down's syndrome. Therefore, USG is a good choice for assessing the risk of Down's syndrome.\\n\\nD. Chorionic villous biopsy: Chorionic villous biopsy is an invasive procedure that involves taking a sample of the placenta to analyze the fetal chromosomes. This is the most accurate method for diagnosing Down's syndrome, but it is not typically used for assessing the risk in the general population.\\n\\nBased on the above evaluation, the best choice for assessing the risk of Down's syndrome in the present pregnancy is USG (Choice C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
