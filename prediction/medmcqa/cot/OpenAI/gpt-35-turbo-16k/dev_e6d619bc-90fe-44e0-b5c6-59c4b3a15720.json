    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms of headache, vomiting, gait instability, diplopia, papilledema, and gait ataxia, along with the age of the patient, the most probable diagnosis is a midline posterior fossa tumor. Hydrocephalus can cause similar symptoms, but it is less likely in this case as the patient also has papilledema and gait ataxia. Brain stem tumors and suprasellar tumors can also present with similar symptoms, but they are less likely in a 10-year-old child. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is a midline posterior fossa tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
