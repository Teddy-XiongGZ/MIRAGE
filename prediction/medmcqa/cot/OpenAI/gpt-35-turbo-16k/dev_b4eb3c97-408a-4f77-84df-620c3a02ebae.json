    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"C-factor refers to the cavity preparation factor for amalgam. It is a measure of the ratio of bonded to unbonded surfaces in a cavity preparation. The higher the C-factor, the greater the polymerization shrinkage stress in the restoration. This can lead to problems such as marginal gaps, microleakage, and post-operative sensitivity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Cavity preparation factor for amalgam.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
