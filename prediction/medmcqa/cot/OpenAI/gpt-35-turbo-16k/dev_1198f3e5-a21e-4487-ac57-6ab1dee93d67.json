    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"1. The patient is a smoker presenting with recent onset breathlessness. This suggests a respiratory or cardiovascular cause for the symptoms.\\n2. An ECG was done to help diagnose the underlying cause.\\n3. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia, but it may not directly cause breathlessness. It is more commonly associated with palpitations.\\n4. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is a rapid heart rate originating above the ventricles. While PSVT can cause symptoms such as palpitations, it is less likely to directly cause breathlessness.\\n5. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a serious condition where there is a blockage in the blood supply to the heart muscle. It can cause symptoms such as breathlessness, chest pain, and ECG changes.\\n6. Multi-focal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a rapid heart rate originating from multiple sites in the atria. It can cause symptoms such as palpitations and breathlessness.\\n7. Given the patient's recent onset breathlessness and the ECG findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute myocardial infarction (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
