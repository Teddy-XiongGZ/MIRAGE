    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To compare the mean peak flow of expiratory rates among different groups (non-smokers, light smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers), we need to use a statistical test that can handle multiple groups. The options provided are: A) One way ANOVA, B) Two way ANOVA, C) Student-t test, and D) Chi square test. The Student-t test is used to compare the means of two independent groups. In this case, we have more than two groups, so the Student-t test is not appropriate. The Chi square test is used to compare categorical variables, not continuous variables like peak flow rates. Therefore, the Chi square test is not the correct choice. The Two way ANOVA is used when we have two independent variables and want to compare the means of a continuous dependent variable. In this case, we only have one independent variable (smoking status), so the Two way ANOVA is not the correct choice. The correct choice for comparing the mean peak flow of expiratory rates among different groups is the One way ANOVA. This test is used to compare the means of three or more independent groups. Therefore, the answer is A) One way ANOVA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
