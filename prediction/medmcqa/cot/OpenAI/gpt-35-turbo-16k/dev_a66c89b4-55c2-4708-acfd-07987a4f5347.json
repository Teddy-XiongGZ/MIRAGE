    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that can penetrate through tissues and create an image on a film or digital detector. The sensitivity of tissues to X-rays depends on their density and atomic composition. Tooth buds and salivary glands are relatively dense and contain calcium, which makes them more sensitive to X-rays. Nerve and muscle tissue have lower density and are less sensitive to X-rays. Hair and nails are composed of keratin, which is not very dense and therefore less sensitive to X-rays. Cartilage is also less dense and contains less calcium compared to tooth buds and salivary glands, making it less sensitive to X-rays.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
