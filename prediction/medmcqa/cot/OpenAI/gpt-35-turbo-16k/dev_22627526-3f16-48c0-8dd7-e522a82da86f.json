    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating hormone secretion. It can exert both stimulatory and inhibitory control over various hormones. To determine which hormones are under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus, we need to consider the hormones that are regulated by hypothalamic inhibitory factors (also known as inhibiting hormones or inhibitory releasing factors). One well-known inhibitory factor released by the hypothalamus is dopamine, which inhibits the secretion of prolactin. Therefore, prolactin is under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. On the other hand, growth hormone (GH) is not under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. Instead, it is regulated by hypothalamic releasing factors (such as growth hormone-releasing hormone, GHRH) that stimulate its secretion. Based on this information, the correct answer is: A. Prolactin\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
