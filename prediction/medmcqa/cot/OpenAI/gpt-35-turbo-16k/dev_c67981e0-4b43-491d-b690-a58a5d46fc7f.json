    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Class III elastic in face masks is used to apply force to the maxillary and mandibular arches in order to correct malocclusion. The direction of force applied by the class III elastic is determined by the type of malocclusion and the desired movement of the teeth. In class III malocclusion, where the lower jaw is protruded relative to the upper jaw, the force applied by the elastic should be directed in a way that helps retract the lower jaw and bring it back into a more normal position. This means that the force should be directed upward from the occlusion, towards the upper jaw. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 15-20 degree upward from occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
