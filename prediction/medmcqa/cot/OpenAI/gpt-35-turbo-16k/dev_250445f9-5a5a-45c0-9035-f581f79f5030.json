    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. It is characterized by multiple cysts in the ovaries, irregular menstrual cycles, and excess androgen production. To determine which statement is not true about PCOD, we need to evaluate each option. \\n\\nA. Persistently elevated LH: In PCOD, there is often an increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. This is because the ovaries produce excess androgens, which can stimulate LH secretion. Therefore, this statement is true about PCOD.\\n\\nB. Increased LH/FSH ratio: PCOD is associated with an increased LH/FSH ratio. This is because the excess androgens produced by the ovaries can disrupt the normal feedback loop between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries, leading to an imbalance in LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Therefore, this statement is true about PCOD.\\n\\nC. Increased Dheas: DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) is an androgen hormone that is often elevated in PCOD. The excess androgens produced by the ovaries can lead to an increase in DHEAS levels. Therefore, this statement is true about PCOD.\\n\\nD. Increased prolactin: Prolactin is a hormone that is primarily involved in milk production. While elevated prolactin levels can be seen in certain conditions, such as prolactinoma (a benign tumor of the pituitary gland), it is not typically associated with PCOD. Therefore, this statement is not true about PCOD.\\n\\nBased on the above explanations, the answer choice is D. Increased prolactin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
