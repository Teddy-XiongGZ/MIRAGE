    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingival massage is a technique used to stimulate blood flow in the gums. The gums, also known as gingiva, are composed of several layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis, which is primarily composed of epithelial cells. The basal layer is located beneath the epidermis and contains basal cells. The lamina propria is the connective tissue layer beneath the basal layer. When gingival massage is performed, it primarily affects the blood supply in the lamina propria, which is the layer responsible for nourishing the gingiva. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Lamina propria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
