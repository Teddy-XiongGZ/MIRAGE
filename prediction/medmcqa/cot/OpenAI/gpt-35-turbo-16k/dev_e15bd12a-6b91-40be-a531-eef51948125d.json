    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation can have various effects on the body depending on the dose and duration of exposure. It can cause damage to cells and tissues, leading to various health effects. Now, let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Cumulative: Radiation exposure can accumulate over time, meaning that repeated or prolonged exposure to radiation can increase the overall damage to the body. This is a possible effect of radiation.\\n\\nB. Fractionalized: This term is not commonly used in the context of radiation effects. It does not accurately describe the effect of radiation.\\n\\nC. Concentrated: Radiation can be concentrated in certain areas or tissues of the body, leading to localized damage. However, this is not the overall effect of radiation.\\n\\nD. Dependent on genetic make-up of individuals: The genetic make-up of individuals can influence their susceptibility to radiation damage. Some individuals may be more sensitive to radiation than others due to genetic factors. However, this is not the primary effect of radiation.\\n\\nConsidering the above explanations, the correct answer is A. Cumulative.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
