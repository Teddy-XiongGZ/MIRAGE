    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post neonatal mortality refers to deaths that occur between 28 days and 1 year of age. To determine the most common cause of post neonatal mortality, we need to consider the factors that can contribute to infant deaths during this period. A. Genetic causes: While genetic conditions can contribute to infant mortality, they are not the most common cause of post neonatal mortality. B. Maternal health during pregnancy: Maternal health during pregnancy can have an impact on infant mortality, but it is not specific to the post neonatal period. C. Environmental causes: Environmental factors such as accidents, injuries, and exposure to toxins can contribute to post neonatal mortality. These factors can include accidents, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and unintentional injuries. D. Conditions affecting the early neonatal period: Conditions that affect the early neonatal period, which refers to the first 28 days of life, are not considered the most common cause of post neonatal mortality. Based on the above considerations, the most common cause of post neonatal mortality is likely C. Environmental causes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
