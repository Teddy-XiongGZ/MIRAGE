    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mesonephros is a temporary kidney structure that develops in the embryo. It gives rise to several structures in both males and females. The paroophoron is a vestigial structure in females that is derived from the mesonephros. The vas deferens and epididymis are male reproductive structures that are also derived from the mesonephros. The glomerulus, on the other hand, is a part of the kidney that is derived from the metanephros, not the mesonephros. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Glomerulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
