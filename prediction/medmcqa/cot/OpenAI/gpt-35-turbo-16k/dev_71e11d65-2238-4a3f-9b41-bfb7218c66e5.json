    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zygomatic arch is a bony structure that forms the prominence of the cheek. It consists of two parts: the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone. Fractures of the zygomatic arch can occur at different sites. A. At the suture: The zygomatic arch is formed by the articulation of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone. Fractures at the suture between these two bones are possible, but they are not the most common site for fracture in zygomatic arch fractures. B. Anterior to zygomaticotemporal suture: The zygomaticotemporal suture is the junction between the zygomatic bone and the temporal bone. Fractures can occur anterior to this suture, but they are not the most common site for fracture in zygomatic arch fractures. C. Posterior to zygomaticotemporal suture: The zygomaticotemporal suture is the junction between the zygomatic bone and the temporal bone. Fractures can occur posterior to this suture, but they are not the most common site for fracture in zygomatic arch fractures. Based on the anatomy and common patterns of injury, the most common site for fracture in zygomatic arch fractures is usually at the junction of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone, which is not specifically mentioned in the given choices. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
