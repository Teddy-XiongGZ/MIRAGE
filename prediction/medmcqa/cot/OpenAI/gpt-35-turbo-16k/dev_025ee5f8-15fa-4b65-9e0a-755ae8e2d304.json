    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A molecule with a permanent dipole is one that has a separation of positive and negative charges, resulting in a non-zero dipole moment. To determine which molecule has a permanent dipole, we need to consider the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the molecule. Oxygen (A) is more electronegative than hydrogen, resulting in a polar covalent bond and a permanent dipole moment. Helium (B) is a noble gas and does not form polar covalent bonds. Liquid nitrogen (C) consists of diatomic nitrogen molecules, which have a non-polar covalent bond and no permanent dipole moment. Water (D) is a polar molecule due to the electronegativity difference between oxygen and hydrogen, resulting in a permanent dipole moment. Therefore, the molecule with a permanent dipole is D. Water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
