    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The treatment of choice for an ovarian cyst in a pregnant woman depends on several factors. First, the size and type of the cyst should be considered. If the cyst is small and functional, it may resolve on its own without any intervention. If the cyst is large or causing symptoms, further management is required. Surgical removal of the cyst during pregnancy is generally avoided due to the risk of complications and potential harm to the fetus. Termination of pregnancy is not necessary unless there are other complications or risks to the mother or fetus. Therefore, the most appropriate option in this case would be observation, with regular monitoring of the cyst's size and symptoms throughout the pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
