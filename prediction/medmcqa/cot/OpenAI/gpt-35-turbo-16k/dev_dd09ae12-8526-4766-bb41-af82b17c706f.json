    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In case of a fracture of the mandible, the alveolar border refers to the part of the mandible that contains the sockets for the teeth. When a fracture occurs, the forces acting on the alveolar border can be analyzed. 1. Tension: Tension forces occur when a structure is pulled apart. In the case of a mandibular fracture, tension forces would not be the primary force acting on the alveolar border because the fracture would cause the bone to separate, not pull apart. 2. Compression: Compression forces occur when a structure is pushed together. In the case of a mandibular fracture, compression forces would be the primary force acting on the alveolar border. The fracture would cause the bone to be compressed together, resulting in a break. 3. Torsion: Torsion forces occur when a structure is twisted. In the case of a mandibular fracture, torsion forces may be present if there is a rotational component to the fracture. However, torsion forces would not be the primary force acting on the alveolar border. 4. Rotation: Rotation forces occur when a structure is turned or rotated. In the case of a mandibular fracture, rotation forces may be present if there is a rotational component to the fracture. However, rotation forces would not be the primary force acting on the alveolar border. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. Compression, as it is the primary force acting on the alveolar border in case of a fracture of the mandible.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
