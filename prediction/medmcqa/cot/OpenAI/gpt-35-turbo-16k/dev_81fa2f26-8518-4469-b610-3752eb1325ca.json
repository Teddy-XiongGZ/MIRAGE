    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During cobalt chromium crown reconstruction, if the temperature of the soldering torch suddenly increases, it will affect the mechanical properties of the material. Cobalt chromium is a type of alloy that exhibits a phenomenon called solid solution strengthening. This means that as the temperature increases, the strength of the material increases. Additionally, as the temperature increases, the ductility of the material decreases. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Yield strength increases and percent elongation decreases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
