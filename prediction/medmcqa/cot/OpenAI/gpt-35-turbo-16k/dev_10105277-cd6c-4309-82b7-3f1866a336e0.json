    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The respiratory center in the brain is primarily stimulated by the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the arterial blood. When the CO2 level increases, it triggers an increase in the respiratory rate to remove the excess CO2 from the body. On the other hand, a decrease in arterial CO2 level would not stimulate the respiratory center. An increase in arterial oxygen level does not directly stimulate the respiratory center. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increase in arterial carbon dioxide level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
