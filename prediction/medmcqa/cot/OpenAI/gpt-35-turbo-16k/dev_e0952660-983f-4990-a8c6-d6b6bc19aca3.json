    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fibres that are attached to the alveolar bone are responsible for supporting and anchoring the teeth. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Transseptal fibers: These fibers run horizontally between adjacent teeth and are attached to the cementum of each tooth. They help maintain the alignment of the teeth and are attached to the alveolar bone.\\n\\nB. Horizontal fibers: These fibers run horizontally from the cementum of the tooth to the alveolar bone. They provide resistance to horizontal forces and are attached to the alveolar bone.\\n\\nC. Oblique fibers: These fibers run diagonally from the cementum of the tooth to the alveolar bone. They provide resistance to vertical and lateral forces and are attached to the alveolar bone.\\n\\nD. Apical fibers: These fibers run from the apex of the tooth to the alveolar bone. They provide support and are attached to the alveolar bone.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, it can be concluded that all of the groups of fibers mentioned (A, B, C, and D) are attached to the alveolar bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
