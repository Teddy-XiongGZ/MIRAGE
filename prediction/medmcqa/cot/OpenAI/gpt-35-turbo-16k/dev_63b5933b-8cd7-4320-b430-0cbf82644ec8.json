    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To preserve blood for transfusion later, it is important to prevent clotting and maintain the viability of the red blood cells. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Diluting with equal volume of 0.9% saline: This option would not prevent clotting or provide any preservative effect.\\n\\nB. Adding solution of sodium citrate: Sodium citrate is commonly used as an anticoagulant in blood collection tubes. It binds to calcium ions, preventing clotting. This option is a suitable choice for preserving blood for transfusion later.\\n\\nC. Adding solution of calcium chloride: Calcium chloride is not used as a preservative for blood. In fact, it can promote clotting by providing calcium ions.\\n\\nD. Adding fibrinogen: Fibrinogen is a clotting factor and adding it to blood would promote clotting, which is not desirable for preserving blood for transfusion later.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct choice is B. Add solution of sodium citrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
