    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The steepest cusp refers to the cusp with the sharpest incline or slope. To determine which tooth has the steepest cusp, we need to consider the anatomy of each tooth. A. Maxillary 1st premolar: This tooth typically has two cusps, a buccal cusp and a lingual cusp. Neither of these cusps is known for having a particularly steep incline. B. Maxillary 1st molar: This tooth has three major cusps - a mesiobuccal cusp, a distobuccal cusp, and a palatal cusp. The mesiobuccal cusp is known for having a steep incline, making it a potential candidate for the steepest cusp. C. Mandibular IInd molar: This tooth also has three major cusps - a mesiobuccal cusp, a distobuccal cusp, and a distal cusp. The mesiobuccal cusp is known for having a steep incline, similar to the maxillary 1st molar. D. Mandibular 1st molar: This tooth has four major cusps - a mesiobuccal cusp, a distobuccal cusp, a mesiolingual cusp, and a distolingual cusp. The mesiobuccal cusp is known for having a steep incline, similar to the maxillary 1st molar and mandibular IInd molar. Based on the anatomy and known characteristics of each tooth, the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary 1st molar, mandibular IInd molar, and mandibular 1st molar are all potential candidates for having the steepest cusp. However, the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary 1st molar is typically the steepest among these options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Maxillary 1st molar\"}"
