    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaerobic glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and does not require oxygen. It involves the breakdown of glucose to produce energy in the form of ATP. During anaerobic glycolysis, glucose is converted into pyruvate, which is then converted into lactate. In this process, 2 ATPs are produced per unit of glucose consumed. However, there is an additional step in anaerobic glycolysis called substrate-level phosphorylation, which can produce an additional ATP. This step occurs when phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted into pyruvate. Now, let's analyze the potential choices: A. Amino acid: Amino acids are not directly involved in anaerobic glycolysis. B. Fructose: Fructose can enter the glycolysis pathway, but it does not produce 3 ATPs per unit glucose consumed. C. Galactose: Galactose can also enter the glycolysis pathway, but it does not produce 3 ATPs per unit glucose consumed. D. Glycogen: Glycogen is a storage form of glucose in animals. When glycogen is broken down through anaerobic glycolysis, it produces 3 ATPs per unit glucose consumed. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Glycogen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
