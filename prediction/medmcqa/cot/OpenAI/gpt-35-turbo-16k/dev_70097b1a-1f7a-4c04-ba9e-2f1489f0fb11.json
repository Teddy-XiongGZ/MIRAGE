    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the most appropriate average for the given data, we need to consider the outliers. Outliers are extreme values that are significantly different from the other values in the dataset. In this case, the value '5000' is much larger than the other values. To avoid the influence of outliers on the average, it is better to use a measure of central tendency that is not affected by extreme values. The most appropriate average in this case would be the median, which is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. This will give us a more representative value for the average number of caries cases reported in the town for the last 10 years.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Median\"}"
