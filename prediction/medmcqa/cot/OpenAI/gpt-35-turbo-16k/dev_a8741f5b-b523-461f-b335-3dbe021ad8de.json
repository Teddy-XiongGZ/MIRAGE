    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In postductal coarctation of the aorta, there is a narrowing or constriction of the aorta after the ductus arteriosus. This narrowing can lead to decreased blood flow to the lower limbs. To compensate for this, collateral circulation develops through other arteries.
