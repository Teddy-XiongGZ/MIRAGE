    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Passavant's ridge is a prominent ridge that can be observed during a physical examination of the oropharynx. It is formed by the contraction of the superior constrictor muscles of the pharynx. To determine its location, we need to understand the anatomy of the oropharynx and nasopharynx. The oropharynx is the part of the pharynx that lies posterior to the oral cavity, while the nasopharynx is the part of the pharynx that lies posterior to the nasal cavity. Passavant's ridge is not located in the nasopharynx because it is formed by the contraction of the superior constrictor muscles, which are not present in the nasopharynx. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Posterior wall of oropharynx.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
