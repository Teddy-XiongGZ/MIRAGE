    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inward deviation of both eyes in an 18-month-old child suggests the possibility of esotropia, which is a type of strabismus. To determine the cause and severity of the esotropia, several tests can be done. \\n\\nFirst, the Forced Duction Test can be performed to assess the restriction of eye movement. This test helps determine if there is any mechanical limitation causing the inward deviation.\\n\\nSecond, the Cover Uncover Test can be done to assess the presence and magnitude of the deviation. This test involves covering one eye and observing the movement of the uncovered eye. If there is a deviation, it will be detected during this test.\\n\\nLastly, a Fundus Examination can be performed to assess the health of the retina and optic nerve. This test can help identify any structural abnormalities that may be contributing to the esotropia.\\n\\nConsidering all these factors, the answer is D. All of the above, as all three tests can provide valuable information in diagnosing and managing the inward deviation of both eyes in an 18-month-old child.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
