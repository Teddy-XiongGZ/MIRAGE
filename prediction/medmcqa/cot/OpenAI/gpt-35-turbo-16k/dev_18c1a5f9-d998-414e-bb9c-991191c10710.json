    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a condition that affects the blood vessels in the retina. Diabetic retinopathy can lead to vision loss if left untreated. Therefore, it is important for patients with diabetes to have regular ophthalmic examinations to detect any signs of retinopathy early. The American Diabetes Association recommends that patients with diabetes have an initial ophthalmic examination shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes is made. After the initial examination, the frequency of follow-up examinations depends on the presence or absence of retinopathy. In this case, since the patient has had diabetes for one year with no other complications, it would be appropriate to have an ophthalmic examination as early as feasible to establish a baseline and monitor for any signs of retinopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
