    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The order of caries susceptibility in primary teeth is determined by various factors such as tooth morphology, oral hygiene, diet, and oral bacteria. Generally, the occlusal surfaces of molars are more susceptible to caries due to their complex anatomy and difficulty in cleaning. Canines, on the other hand, have a simpler anatomy and are easier to clean. Based on this information, the correct order of caries susceptibility in primary teeth is likely to be: 1st molar>2nd molar>canine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
