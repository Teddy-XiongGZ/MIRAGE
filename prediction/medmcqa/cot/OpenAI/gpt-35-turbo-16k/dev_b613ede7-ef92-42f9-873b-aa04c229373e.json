    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental plaque is a sticky film that forms on the teeth and is composed of bacteria, food particles, and saliva. The bacteria in dental plaque produce enzymes that break down carbohydrates, specifically sugars, into acids. These acids then react with the minerals in the saliva and form dental plaque. Sucrose is a type of sugar commonly found in foods and beverages, and it can be broken down by the enzymes produced by bacteria in dental plaque. Lipids are fats, and while they can contribute to the formation of dental plaque, they are not directly involved in the reaction of enzymes. Glucose is a type of sugar, and it can also be broken down by the enzymes in dental plaque. Proteins, on the other hand, are not directly involved in the formation of dental plaque. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Glucose and lipids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
