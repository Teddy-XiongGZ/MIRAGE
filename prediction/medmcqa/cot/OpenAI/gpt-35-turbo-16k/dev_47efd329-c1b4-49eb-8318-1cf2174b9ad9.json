    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel is the outermost layer of the tooth and is composed mainly of hydroxyapatite crystals. It is a highly mineralized tissue with a low water content. The water content in enamel by volume is relatively low compared to other tissues in the body. Let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. 2-3%: This is a relatively low water content and could be a possibility. \\nB. 6-7%: This is a higher water content and is unlikely for enamel. \\nC. 20-25%: This is a very high water content and is not consistent with the composition of enamel. \\nD. 10-12%: This is a moderate water content and could be a possibility. \\n\\nBased on the composition of enamel and the options provided, the most likely answer is A. 2-3%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
