    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Plate endings are specialized sensory receptors found in muscle spindles. Muscle spindles are sensory organs located within skeletal muscles that detect changes in muscle length and tension. The two types of sensory fibers found in muscle spindles are nuclear chain fibers and nuclear bag fibers. Golgi tendon organs, on the other hand, are sensory receptors located in tendons that detect changes in muscle tension. Extrafusal fibers are the regular muscle fibers responsible for generating force and movement. Therefore, the correct answer is either A. Nuclear chain fibers or B. Nuclear bag fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
