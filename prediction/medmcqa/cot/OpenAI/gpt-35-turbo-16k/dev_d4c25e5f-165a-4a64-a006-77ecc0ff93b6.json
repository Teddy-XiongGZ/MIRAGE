    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Interglobular dentin refers to areas of dentin where the mineralization process was incomplete, resulting in gaps or spaces between the mineralized dentin matrix. These areas are typically seen as dark, unstained regions under a microscope. A. Has less mineral content: Interglobular dentin does indeed have less mineral content compared to fully mineralized dentin. The incomplete mineralization process leads to the formation of these gaps or spaces. B. Shows PAS reaction: PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) reaction is a staining technique used to detect the presence of carbohydrates, such as glycosaminoglycans, in tissues. Interglobular dentin does not typically show a positive PAS reaction because it lacks the fully formed dentin matrix. C. Both: The correct answer is C. Both options A and B are true for interglobular dentin. D. None: This option is incorrect as both options A and B are true for interglobular dentin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
