    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a 75-year-old chronic smoker who is diabetic and edentulous for the last 30 years, the treatment modality should take into consideration the patient's overall health status and the specific fracture pattern. Considering the patient's age and comorbidities, it is important to choose a treatment option that minimizes surgical complications and promotes healing. A. ORIF with reconstruction plate: This option involves open reduction and internal fixation with a reconstruction plate. While this may provide stable fixation, it is a more invasive procedure and may carry a higher risk of complications in a patient with multiple comorbidities. B. Gunning splints: Gunning splints are typically used for mandibular fractures and may not be suitable for a bilateral body fracture in this case. C. Two mini plates: This option involves using two mini plates for fixation. While mini plates can provide stable fixation, the choice of fixation method should be based on the specific fracture pattern and the patient's overall health status. D. Wire osteosynthesis: Wire osteosynthesis involves using wires to stabilize the fracture. This may be a less invasive option compared to ORIF with reconstruction plate and may be suitable for a patient with multiple comorbidities. Considering the patient's age, comorbidities, and the need for a less invasive procedure, the best treatment modality in this case would be D. Wire osteosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
