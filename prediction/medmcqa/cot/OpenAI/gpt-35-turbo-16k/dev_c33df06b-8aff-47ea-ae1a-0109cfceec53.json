    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The adrenal gland is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. The preganglionic fibers responsible for innervating the adrenal gland originate from the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spinal segments of the sympathetic chain. These fibers synapse in the adrenal medulla, which is the inner part of the adrenal gland. The adrenal cortex, which is the outer part of the adrenal gland responsible for producing hormones, does not have direct nerve supply. The release of catecholamines, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, is regulated by the nerve supply to the adrenal medulla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
