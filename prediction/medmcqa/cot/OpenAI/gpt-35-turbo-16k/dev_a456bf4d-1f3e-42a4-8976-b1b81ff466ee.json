    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the position of the roots on a radiograph, we need to consider the angulation and direction of the x-ray beam. In this case, since the facial root appears distal to the palatal root, it means that the facial root is positioned more towards the back of the tooth compared to the palatal root. This suggests that the x-ray beam was directed from the mesial side of the tooth towards the distal side. Therefore, the correct answer is C. From mesial side of the tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
