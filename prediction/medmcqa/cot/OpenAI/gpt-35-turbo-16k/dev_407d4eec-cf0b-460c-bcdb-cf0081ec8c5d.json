    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Methacholine is a muscarinic agonist, which means it acts on muscarinic receptors. There are five subtypes of muscarinic receptors: M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5. To determine which receptor methacholine acts on, we need to consider its selectivity. Methacholine is primarily selective for the M3 receptor subtype. Therefore, the correct answer is C. M3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
