    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies that are attached to the surface of red blood cells. It is commonly used to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys red blood cells. In AIHA, the Direct Coombs test is positive because it detects the presence of antibodies on the red blood cells. Option A, Hemolytic anemia due to transfusion, can also cause a positive Direct Coombs test. This occurs when the recipient's immune system recognizes the transfused red blood cells as foreign and produces antibodies against them. Option B, Hemolytic anemia due to transfusion, is the same as option A and is incorrect. Option C, Aplastic anemia, is a condition where the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells. It is not associated with the presence of antibodies on the red blood cells, so the Direct Coombs test would be negative. Option D, Drug-induced AIHA, is a type of AIHA that is triggered by certain medications. In this condition, the Direct Coombs test would be positive because it detects the antibodies on the red blood cells. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Aplastic anemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
