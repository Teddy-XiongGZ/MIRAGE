    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Breast milk is known to provide essential nutrients for the normal growth and development of a child. One of these essential nutrients is an essential fatty acid. To determine which essential fatty acid is present in breast milk, we need to consider the known essential fatty acids and their importance for child growth. Lenoleic acid is an essential fatty acid that is required for normal growth and development. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid and not an essential fatty acid. Docosahexanoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 fatty acid that is important for brain development but is not considered an essential fatty acid. EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) is also an omega-3 fatty acid but is not considered an essential fatty acid. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Lenoleic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
