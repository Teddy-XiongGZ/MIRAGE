    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The earliest transient change following tissue injury is typically an increase in neutrophils, known as neutrophilia. Neutrophils are the first responders to tissue injury and inflammation, and their numbers increase rapidly in response to injury. Neutropenia, on the other hand, refers to a decrease in neutrophil count and is not typically seen immediately following tissue injury. Monocytoses and lymphocytoses refer to an increase in monocytes and lymphocytes, respectively, which are not the earliest changes seen following tissue injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
