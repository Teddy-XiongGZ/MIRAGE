    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, which means she has not yet had her first period. She started developing breasts at the age of 12, which indicates that she has normal breast development. However, her pubic hair is minimal, indicating that she has minimal or no pubic hair development. This suggests that there is a problem with the development of her external genitalia. The most likely diagnosis in this case is Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. This condition is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper part of the vagina, while the ovaries are usually normal. This condition can present with primary amenorrhea and normal breast development. Turner's syndrome is characterized by the absence of one X chromosome in females and typically presents with short stature, webbed neck, and other physical abnormalities. Premature ovarian failure is the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 and is unlikely in this case as the patient is only 16 years old. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition in which individuals with XY chromosomes have a partial or complete inability to respond to androgens. This condition typically presents with normal breast development and minimal or absent pubic hair, but it is usually associated with the absence of a uterus and upper part of the vagina, which is not the case in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Miillerian agenesis\"}"
