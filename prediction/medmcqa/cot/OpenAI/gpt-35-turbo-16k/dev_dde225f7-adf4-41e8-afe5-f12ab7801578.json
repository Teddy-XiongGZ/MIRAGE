    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The principal reason for placing an aluminium filter in the primary beam of radiation is to reduce radiation to the skin of the patient. Aluminum filters are commonly used in radiography to remove low-energy x-rays from the primary beam. These low-energy x-rays are more likely to be absorbed by the patient's skin, leading to unnecessary radiation exposure. By placing an aluminum filter in the primary beam, the filter selectively removes these low-energy x-rays, reducing radiation to the skin of the patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
