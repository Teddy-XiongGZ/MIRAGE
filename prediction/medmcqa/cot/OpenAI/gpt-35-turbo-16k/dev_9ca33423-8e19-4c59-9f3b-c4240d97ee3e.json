    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet. To determine the essential amino acids among the given choices, we need to identify the amino acids that meet this criteria. A. Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, Lysine: Phenylalanine and Tryptophan are essential amino acids, but Lysine is also essential, so this option contains three essential amino acids. B. Phenylalanine, Asparagine, Methionine: Asparagine is a non-essential amino acid, so this option does not contain all essential amino acids. C. Phenylalanine, Valine, Glycine: Glycine is a non-essential amino acid, so this option does not contain all essential amino acids. D. Histidine, Glutamine, Valine: Histidine and Valine are essential amino acids, but Glutamine is a non-essential amino acid, so this option does not contain all essential amino acids. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is A. Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, Lysine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
