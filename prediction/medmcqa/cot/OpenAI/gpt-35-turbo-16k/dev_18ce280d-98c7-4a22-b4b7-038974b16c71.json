    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule that has various physiological functions. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Nitric oxide does regulate vasomotor tone. It acts as a vasodilator, relaxing the smooth muscles in blood vessels and thereby increasing blood flow.\\n\\nB. Nitric oxide does not act via cAMP. It acts by activating the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).\\n\\nC. Nitric oxide is indeed present in cigarette smoke. It is one of the many harmful components of cigarette smoke.\\n\\nD. Nitric oxide is important in penile erection. It acts as a signaling molecule to relax the smooth muscles in the blood vessels of the penis, allowing increased blood flow and erection.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the option that is NOT true about nitric oxide is B. It does not act via cAMP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
