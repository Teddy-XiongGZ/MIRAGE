    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the tooth in which the buccal surface is made of 2 lobes, we need to consider the anatomy of the teeth. The buccal surface refers to the outer surface of the tooth that faces the cheek. In general, molars have multiple cusps or lobes on their occlusal surface. However, when it comes to the buccal surface, the upper molars typically have 3 lobes, while the lower molars usually have 2 lobes. Therefore, the tooth in which the buccal surface is made of 2 lobes is the Lower 1st molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Lower 1st molar\"}"
