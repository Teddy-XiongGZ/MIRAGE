    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best marker for neural tube defect is alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Neural tube defects are congenital abnormalities that occur during the development of the neural tube, which eventually forms the brain and spinal cord. AFP is a protein produced by the developing fetus and is normally found in the amniotic fluid and maternal blood. In cases of neural tube defects, there is an increased level of AFP in the amniotic fluid and maternal blood. Therefore, alpha fetoprotein is the best marker for neural tube defects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
