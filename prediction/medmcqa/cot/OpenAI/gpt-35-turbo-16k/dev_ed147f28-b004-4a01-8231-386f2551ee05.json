    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the case based on the cephalogram findings, we need to analyze the ANB angle and the facial angle. The ANB angle is the angle formed between the A point (the most anterior point on the maxilla) and the B point (the most posterior point on the mandible). A negative ANB angle indicates that the mandible is positioned more anteriorly than the maxilla, suggesting a Class III malocclusion. The facial angle is the angle formed between the sella (S) point, nasion (N) point, and point A. A facial angle of 98\u00b0 is within the normal range. Therefore, based on the cephalogram findings, the case is most likely a True Class III malocclusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
