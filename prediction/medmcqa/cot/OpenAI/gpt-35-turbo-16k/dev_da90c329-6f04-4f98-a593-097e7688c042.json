    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The facial proportions between the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the face can vary slightly among individuals, but there is a general guideline. The upper third of the face includes the forehead and hairline, the middle third includes the nose and cheeks, and the lower third includes the mouth and chin. Based on this, we can eliminate options A and D since they have unequal proportions for the upper and lower thirds. Now, we are left with options B and C. Option B has equal proportions for the middle and lower thirds, which is not consistent with the general guideline. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, which has proportions of 35:30:35 for the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the face.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
