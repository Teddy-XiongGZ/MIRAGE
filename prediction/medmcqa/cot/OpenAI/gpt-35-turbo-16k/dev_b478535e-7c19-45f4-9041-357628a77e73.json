    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To assess outcome from labour, cost, and time, we need to consider the effectiveness and utility of the intervention. Cost benefit analysis compares the costs and benefits of an intervention, but it does not specifically consider the time and labor involved. Cost effectiveness analysis evaluates the cost of an intervention in relation to its effectiveness, which includes considering the outcome from labor.
