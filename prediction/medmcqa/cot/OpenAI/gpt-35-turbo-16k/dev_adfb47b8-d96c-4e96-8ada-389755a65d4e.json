    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, there are several physiological changes that occur to support the growing fetus. Let's analyze each option to determine which one does not increase at full term in pregnancy. \\n\\nA. Minute volume refers to the amount of air breathed in one minute. During pregnancy, minute volume increases due to the increased oxygen demand of the mother and the fetus. Therefore, minute volume increases at full term in pregnancy. \\n\\nB. GFR (glomerular filtration rate) refers to the rate at which the kidneys filter blood. During pregnancy, GFR increases to accommodate the increased metabolic waste produced by the mother and the fetus. Therefore, GFR also increases at full term in pregnancy. \\n\\nC. Blood volume increases during pregnancy to support the increased metabolic needs of the mother and the fetus. This increase in blood volume is necessary to provide adequate oxygen and nutrients to the developing fetus. Therefore, blood volume also increases at full term in pregnancy. \\n\\nD. Cardiac output refers to the amount of blood pumped by the heart in one minute. During pregnancy, cardiac output increases to meet the increased metabolic demands of the mother and the fetus. Therefore, cardiac output also increases at full term in pregnancy. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Cardiac output does not increase at full term in pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
