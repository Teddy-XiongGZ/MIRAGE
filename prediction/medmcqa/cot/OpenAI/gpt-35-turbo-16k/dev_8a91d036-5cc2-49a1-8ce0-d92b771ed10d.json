    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The electric nerve tester is used to detect pain by stimulating nerve fibers. In reversible pulpitis, there is sharp, shooting pain. In pulp hyperemia, there is an increased blood flow to the pulp. Based on this information, we can determine the type of nerve fibers that are stimulated in these conditions. A alpha fibers are responsible for proprioception and motor control, so they are not likely to be stimulated in these situations. A beta fibers are responsible for touch and pressure sensation, so they are also unlikely to be stimulated. A delta fibers are responsible for sharp, fast pain sensation, so they are a possible option. C fibers are responsible for slow, dull pain sensation, so they are also a possible option. Considering the sharp, shooting pain in reversible pulpitis, the most likely answer is C. A delta fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
