    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epithelial lining is a type of tissue that covers the surfaces of organs, vessels, and cavities in the body. It is typically found in various locations throughout the body. To determine which option does not typically have an epithelial lining, we need to consider the nature of each choice. \\n\\nA. Sinuses: Sinuses are air-filled cavities within the skull bones. They are lined by a specialized type of epithelial tissue called respiratory epithelium. Therefore, sinuses typically have an epithelial lining.\\n\\nB. Fistulae: Fistulae are abnormal connections or passageways between two organs or vessels. They can occur due to various reasons, such as infection, injury, or surgery. Fistulae can be lined by different types of tissues, including epithelial tissue. Therefore, it is possible for fistulae to have an epithelial lining.\\n\\nC. Aneurismal bone cysts: Aneurismal bone cysts are benign bone tumors that can occur in various bones of the body. They are characterized by the presence of blood-filled cysts. Since aneurismal bone cysts are primarily composed of blood-filled spaces within the bone, they do not typically have an epithelial lining.\\n\\nD. Keratocytes: Keratocytes are a type of cell found in the cornea of the eye. They are responsible for producing and maintaining the transparent structure of the cornea. Since keratocytes are cells and not a specific anatomical structure, it is not appropriate to consider them in the context of having an epithelial lining.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the option that does not typically have an epithelial lining is C. Aneurismal bone cysts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
