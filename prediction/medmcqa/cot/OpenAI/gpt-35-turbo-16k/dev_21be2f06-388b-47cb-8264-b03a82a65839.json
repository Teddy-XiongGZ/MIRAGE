    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Long face syndrome is characterized by an increased lower facial height. The palatal plane refers to the horizontal plane passing through the hard palate. In long face syndrome, the increased lower facial height is typically due to excessive vertical growth of the maxilla and mandible. As a result, the palatal plane will be affected. To determine the direction of the palatal plane, we need to consider the changes in the position of the maxilla and mandible. In long face syndrome, the maxilla and mandible tend to grow downward and forward, causing the palatal plane to be downward anteriorly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Downward anteriorly\"}"
