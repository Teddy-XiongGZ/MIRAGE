    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Supplementary retention on the abutment tooth refers to additional means of retaining a dental restoration, such as a crown or bridge, on the tooth. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Greater bulk of metal: While a greater bulk of metal can provide some retention, it is not specifically related to supplementary retention.\\n\\nB. Proper cementation technique: Proper cementation technique is important for ensuring a secure bond between the restoration and the tooth, but it does not directly provide supplementary retention.\\n\\nC. Shoulder preparation: Shoulder preparation involves creating a distinct shoulder or ledge on the tooth, which can enhance retention of the restoration. This is a possible answer.\\n\\nD. Proper use of pins and grooves: The use of pins and grooves can provide additional mechanical retention for the restoration, making it a possible answer.\\n\\nConsidering the options, both C (shoulder preparation) and D (proper use of pins and grooves) can contribute to supplementary retention on the abutment tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C/D\"}"
