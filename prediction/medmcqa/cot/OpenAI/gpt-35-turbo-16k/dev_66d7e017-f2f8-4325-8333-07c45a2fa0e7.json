    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Striated muscle refers to skeletal muscle, which is under voluntary control. Innervation of skeletal muscle is carried by motor neurons. Motor neurons are myelinated fibers that transmit signals from the central nervous system to the muscle fibers. The motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscle are called alpha motor neurons. These alpha motor neurons are responsible for activating the muscle fibers and causing muscle contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is not A, B, or C, as these refer to sensory fibers or unmyelinated fibers. The correct answer is D. Gamma fibers are also myelinated fibers that innervate the muscle spindle, which is a sensory receptor within the muscle. However, the question specifically asks about innervation of the striated muscle, which is carried by alpha motor neurons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
