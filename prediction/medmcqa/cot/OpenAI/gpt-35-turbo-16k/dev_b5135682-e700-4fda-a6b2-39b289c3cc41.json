    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a patient is asked to say 'ah', the uvula should rise symmetrically in the midline. If the uvula is drawn upwards to the left, it suggests a dysfunction of the cranial nerve responsible for innervating the muscles involved in this movement. The cranial nerve responsible for elevating the uvula during phonation is the vagus nerve (CN X). Therefore, if the uvula is drawn upwards to the left, the cranial nerve likely to be damaged is the vagus nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
