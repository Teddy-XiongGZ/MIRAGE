    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Iron enters enterocyte by multiple mechanisms. One of the main mechanisms is through divalent cation transporters. These transporters are responsible for the uptake of various divalent cations, including iron. Ferroportin is a protein that is involved in the export of iron from enterocytes into the bloodstream. Hephaestin is an enzyme that facilitates the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron, which is then transported across the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. Ceruloplasmin is a copper-containing protein that is involved in the transport of copper, not iron. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Divalent cation transporter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
