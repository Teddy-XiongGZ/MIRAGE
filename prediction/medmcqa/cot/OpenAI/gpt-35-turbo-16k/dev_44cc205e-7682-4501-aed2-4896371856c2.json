    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Flexion, adduction, and internal rotation is a characteristic posture in posterior dislocation of the hip joint. In this type of dislocation, the femoral head is displaced posteriorly and superiorly in relation to the acetabulum. This causes the affected leg to be flexed, adducted (moved towards the midline), and internally rotated. Anterior dislocation of the hip joint would result in a different posture, with the affected leg being abducted (moved away from the midline) and externally rotated. Fracture of the femoral head or shaft would not cause this specific posture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Posterior dislocation of hip joint\"}"
