    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In root fracture of the apical one-third of permanent anterior teeth, the teeth usually undergo pulp necrosis and become ankylosed. This is because the fracture disrupts the blood supply to the pulp, leading to its death. Ankylosis occurs when the root of the tooth fuses with the surrounding bone, causing it to become immobile. Discoloration and vitality of the tooth are not typically associated with root fractures. Extraction and prosthetic replacement may be considered if the tooth is non-restorable or causes functional or aesthetic problems.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
