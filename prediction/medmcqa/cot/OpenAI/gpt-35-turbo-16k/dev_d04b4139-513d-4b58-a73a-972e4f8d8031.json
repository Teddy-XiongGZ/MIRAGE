    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To avoid failure of partial dentures due to poor clasp design, several factors need to be considered. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Using stress breakers: Stress breakers are used to distribute forces evenly and reduce stress on the denture. While they can help in certain cases, they may not directly address poor clasp design.\\n\\nB. Using bar type clasps: Bar type clasps provide better retention and stability compared to other types of clasps. However, they may not specifically address poor clasp design.\\n\\nC. Altering tooth contours: Altering tooth contours can help improve the fit and stability of the denture. However, it may not directly address poor clasp design.\\n\\nD. Clasping only those teeth with fairly long crowns and normal bone support: This option focuses on selecting teeth with better crown length and bone support for clasp placement. This can help improve the overall stability and longevity of the denture.\\n\\nConsidering the options, it appears that option D, clasping only those teeth with fairly long crowns and normal bone support, is the best choice to avoid failure of partial dentures due to poor clasp design.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
