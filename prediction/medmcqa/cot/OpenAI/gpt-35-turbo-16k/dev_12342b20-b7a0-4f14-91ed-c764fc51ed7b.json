    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sensory supply of the cornea is provided by the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1). The ophthalmic nerve gives rise to several branches, including the supraorbital nerve, infratrochlear nerve, and nasociliary nerve. The infraorbital nerve, on the other hand, is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2) and does not directly supply the cornea. Therefore, the correct answer is either B. Supraorbital nerve, C. Infratrochlear nerve, or D. Nasociliary nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
