    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Wide divergent roots of primary teeth can cause problems during resorption and extraction. During resorption, if the roots are wide and divergent, it may be difficult for the body to completely resorb the apical 1/3rd of the root, leading to its retention. This can result in the persistence of the primary tooth and delay in the eruption of the permanent tooth. On the other hand, during extraction, the wide and divergent roots can increase the risk of fracture of the apical 1/3rd of the root, especially if there is excessive force applied during the extraction process. Therefore, both options A and B are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
