    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described, delayed motor development, mental retardation, finger biting, cerebral palsy, and renal failure, the likely enzyme deficiency implicated is Hexosaminidase deficiency. Hexosaminidase deficiency is associated with a group of disorders known as Tay-Sachs disease, which presents with neurologic symptoms such as delayed motor development, mental retardation, and finger biting. Additionally, the development of cerebral palsy and renal failure further supports the diagnosis of Hexosaminidase deficiency. Adenosine deaminase deficiency is associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), HGP deficiency is associated with glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I), and Ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency is associated with urea cycle disorders, none of which fully match the symptoms described in the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
