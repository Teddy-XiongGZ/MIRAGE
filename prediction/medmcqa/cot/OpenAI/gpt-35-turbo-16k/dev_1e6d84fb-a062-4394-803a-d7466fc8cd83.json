    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is formed when phosphoric acid reacts with calcium hydroxide. The reaction equation is: H3PO4 + Ca(OH)2 -> CaHPO4.H2O + 2H2O. From the equation, we can see that 1 mole of phosphoric acid reacts with 1 mole of calcium hydroxide to form 1 mole of dicalcium phosphate monohydrate. The molar mass of phosphoric acid is 98 g/mol, and the molar mass of dicalcium phosphate monohydrate is 172 g/mol. Therefore, the percentage of phosphoric acid that cannot be rinsed off is (98/172) x 100 = 56.98%. Since none of the given choices match this value, we cannot determine the exact percentage from the options provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
