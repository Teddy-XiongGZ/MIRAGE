It needs to be transparent to X-rays and provide a stable support for the emulsion. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Polyester: Polyester is a common material used in X-ray film base due to its transparency to X-rays and stability.\\n\\nB. Gelatin: Gelatin is not typically used as the base material for X-ray films. It is commonly used as the material for the emulsion layer.\\n\\nC. Nylon: Nylon is not commonly used as the base material for X-ray films. It is not as transparent to X-rays as polyester.\\n\\nD. Bromide: Bromide is not used as the base material for X-ray films. It is a chemical compound used in the emulsion layer.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is A. Polyester.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
