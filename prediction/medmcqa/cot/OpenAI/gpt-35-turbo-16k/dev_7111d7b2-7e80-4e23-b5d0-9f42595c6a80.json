    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"2,3-BPG binds to sites on hemoglobin and affects its affinity for oxygen. The question is asking about the effect of 2,3-BPG on the affinity for oxygen. To determine the effect, we need to understand the relationship between 2,3-BPG and oxygen affinity. 2,3-BPG is a molecule that binds to deoxygenated hemoglobin and stabilizes the T-state conformation, which has a lower affinity for oxygen. This means that when 2,3-BPG binds to hemoglobin, it decreases the affinity for oxygen. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 1, decreases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
