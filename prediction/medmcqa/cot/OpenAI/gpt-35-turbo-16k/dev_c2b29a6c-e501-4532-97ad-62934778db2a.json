    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A solid solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances in a solid state. To determine which of the given options is a solid solution, we need to understand the nature of each substance. \\n\\nA. Amalgam is a mixture of mercury with another metal, such as silver or tin. It is a liquid solution, not a solid solution. \\n\\nB. Cobalt-chromium is an alloy composed of cobalt and chromium. It is a solid solution because the cobalt and chromium atoms are evenly distributed throughout the alloy. \\n\\nC. Silver-palladium is also an alloy composed of silver and palladium. It is a solid solution because the silver and palladium atoms are evenly distributed throughout the alloy. \\n\\nD. Gallium-silver is an alloy composed of gallium and silver. It is a solid solution because the gallium and silver atoms are evenly distributed throughout the alloy. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is B. Cobalt-chromium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
