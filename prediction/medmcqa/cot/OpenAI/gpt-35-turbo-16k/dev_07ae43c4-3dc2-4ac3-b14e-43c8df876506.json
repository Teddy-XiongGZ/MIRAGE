    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To send a blood sample for blood glucose testing, an anticoagulant is required to prevent the blood from clotting. The most commonly used anticoagulant for this purpose is potassium oxalate + sodium fluoride. Potassium oxalate acts as an anticoagulant by binding to calcium ions, which are necessary for the clotting process. Sodium fluoride is added to the mixture to inhibit the enzyme that breaks down glucose in the blood, thus preserving the glucose levels for accurate testing. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Potassium oxalate + sodium fluoride.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
