    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bifid tongue is a congenital anomaly characterized by a split or divided appearance of the tongue. To determine the cause of bifid tongue, we need to understand the normal development of the tongue. During embryonic development, the tongue forms from multiple swellings and processes that fuse together. The tuberculum impar is a midline swelling, while the lateral lingual swellings are two swellings on either side of the tuberculum impar. The hypobranchial eminence is a structure that contributes to the development of the tongue base. In the case of bifid tongue, the non-fusion of certain structures leads to the split appearance. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Tuberculum impar and lateral lingual swellings. These are the structures that fail to fuse together, resulting in bifid tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
