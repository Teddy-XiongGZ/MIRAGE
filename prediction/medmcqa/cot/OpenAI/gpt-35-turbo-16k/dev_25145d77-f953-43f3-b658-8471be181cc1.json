    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's analyze the ABG values. The pH is within the normal range (7.35-7.45), so there is no primary acid-base disturbance. The pCO2 is also within the normal range (35-45 mm Hg), indicating normal respiratory function. The HCO3 level is slightly elevated at 25 mEq/L, which suggests a metabolic alkalosis. However, the question states that the patient has protracted vomiting, which can lead to a loss of gastric acid and subsequent metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, the observation is a metabolic alkalosis. The correct answer is D. High anion gap metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
