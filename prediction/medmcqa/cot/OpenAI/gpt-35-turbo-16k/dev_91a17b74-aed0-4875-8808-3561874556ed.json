    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's analyze each option. Option A states that Actinomycin D is a monoclonal antibody. Actinomycin D is actually an antibiotic and not an antibody, so option A is false. Option B states that Actinomycin D is not cell specific but is cell cycle specific. This is true, as Actinomycin D inhibits DNA synthesis and is most effective during the S phase of the cell cycle. Option C states that Vinblastine is not cell specific but is cycle/phase specific. This is also true, as Vinblastine disrupts microtubule formation and is most effective during the M phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, the answer is D. None of the above, as options A, B, and C all have statements that are not true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
