    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Domestic violence can cause various types of fractures in children. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Wormian bones: Wormian bones are extra bones that can be found in the skull. They are not specific to domestic violence and can occur in normal individuals as well. Therefore, this option is not suggestive of domestic violence.\\n\\nB. Microfractures in the sub-epiphyseal region: Microfractures in the sub-epiphyseal region, also known as metaphyseal corner fractures, are highly suggestive of child abuse. These fractures occur due to a shearing force applied to the growing bone. Therefore, this option is suggestive of domestic violence.\\n\\nC. Corner fractures: Corner fractures are another term for metaphyseal corner fractures, which are mentioned in option B. As explained earlier, these fractures are highly suggestive of child abuse. Therefore, this option is suggestive of domestic violence.\\n\\nD. Bucket handle fractures of metaphyses: Bucket handle fractures are typically seen in cases of child abuse. These fractures occur when a bone is forcefully twisted or pulled. Therefore, this option is suggestive of domestic violence.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is A. Wormian bones, as they are not specific to domestic violence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
