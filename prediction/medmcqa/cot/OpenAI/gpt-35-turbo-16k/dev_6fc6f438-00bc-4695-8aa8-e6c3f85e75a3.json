    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the gums and supporting structures of the teeth. It is primarily caused by the accumulation of dental plaque, which is a biofilm composed of various bacteria.

Bacteroides, Wolinella, Neisseria, and Eikenella are all known to be involved in periodontal disease. Therefore, none of these organisms can be ruled out based on their association with periodontal disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
