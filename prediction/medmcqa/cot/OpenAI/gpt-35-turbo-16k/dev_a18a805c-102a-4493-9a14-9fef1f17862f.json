    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Widal test is a serological test used to diagnose typhoid fever. It detects antibodies against the bacteria Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not true. A. Base lines differ depending on the endemicity of the disease. This is true because the baseline values for the Widal test can vary depending on the prevalence of the disease in a particular region. B. O antibodies last longer and hence is not indicative of recent infection. This is also true because O antibodies can persist for a long time after an infection, making it difficult to determine if the infection is recent. C. H antigen cannot differentiate between subtypes. This is true because the H antigen is shared by different subtypes of Salmonella, so it cannot be used to differentiate between them. D. High titre value in a single Widal test is not confirmative. This is not true because a high titre value in a single Widal test is considered confirmatory for typhoid fever. Therefore, the answer is D. High titre value in a single widal test is not confirmative.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
