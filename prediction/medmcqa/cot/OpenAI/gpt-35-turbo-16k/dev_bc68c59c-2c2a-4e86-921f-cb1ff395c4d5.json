    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"IDL stands for Intermediate Density Lipoprotein. It is a lipoprotein that is formed from the degradation of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). IDL contains a combination of different apolipoproteins. Apolipoproteins are proteins that bind to lipids to form lipoproteins. Apo B100 is the main apolipoprotein found in VLDL and LDL (low-density lipoprotein). Apo E is another apolipoprotein that is found in IDL. Apo C is not typically found in IDL, but it is found in other lipoproteins such as chylomicrons and VLDL. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above, as IDL contains both Apo B100 and Apo E.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
