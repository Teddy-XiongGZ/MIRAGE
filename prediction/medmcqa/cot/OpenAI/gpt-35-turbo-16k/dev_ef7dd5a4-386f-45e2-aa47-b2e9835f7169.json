    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Autogenic inhibition refers to the reflex inhibition of a muscle contraction in response to excessive tension. It is mediated by the Golgi tendon organ, which is located in the tendons of skeletal muscles. When the Golgi tendon organ detects excessive tension in the muscle, it sends inhibitory signals to the muscle fibers, causing them to relax and prevent further contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Golgi tendon organ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
