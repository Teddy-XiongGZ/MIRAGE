    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent hemoptysis, the underlying cause of the bleeding needs to be addressed. In this case, since the patient has a history of massive hemoptysis and normal routine investigations and chest X-ray, it is likely that the bleeding is originating from the bronchial or pulmonary arteries. Therefore, options A and B, which involve embolization of the bronchial or pulmonary arteries respectively, are potential interventions to prevent hemoptysis. Option C, bronchoscopic laser cauterization, is also a possible intervention to stop bleeding from the bronchial tree. However, option D, lobectomy of the affected segment, involves surgical removal of the affected lung segment and is not typically done as a preventive measure for hemoptysis. Therefore, the answer choice is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
