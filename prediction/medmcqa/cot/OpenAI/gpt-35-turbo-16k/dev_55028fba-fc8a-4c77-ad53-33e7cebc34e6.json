    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fourth generation apex locater is based on advanced technology compared to previous generations. To determine the position of the apex accurately, it utilizes a combination of different factors. Resistance is a measure of opposition to the flow of electric current, and while it may be used in some apex locaters, it is not the sole basis for fourth generation devices. Impedance is a measure of the total opposition to the flow of electric current, including both resistance and reactance. While impedance may be used in some apex locaters, it is not the only factor for fourth generation devices. Frequency refers to the number of cycles of an alternating current that occur in one second. While frequency may be used in some apex locaters, it is not the sole basis for fourth generation devices. Multiple frequency ratio is a technique used in fourth generation apex locaters, where multiple frequencies are used to determine the position of the apex accurately. This technique helps to overcome the limitations of single frequency devices. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Multiple frequency ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
