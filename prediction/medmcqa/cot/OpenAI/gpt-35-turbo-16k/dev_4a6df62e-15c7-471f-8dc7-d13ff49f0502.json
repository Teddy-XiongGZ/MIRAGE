    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulpal medication is used to treat the pulp of a tooth, which is the innermost part containing nerves and blood vessels. Thermal protection is important to protect the pulp from temperature changes during dental procedures. A. Solution liners (2-5 \u03bcm): Solution liners are thin liquid materials that are used to seal the dentin and provide a protective barrier. They are not typically used for thermal protection. B. Suspension Liners (25-30 \u03bcm): Suspension liners are thicker materials that are used to provide thermal protection to the pulp. They are applied as a suspension and can provide a thermal barrier. C. Traditional Liner (0.2-0.3 mm): Traditional liners are thicker materials that are used to provide thermal protection and insulation to the pulp. They are typically made of materials like calcium hydroxide or glass ionomer cement. D. Cement bases: Cement bases are used to provide support and stability to restorations, but they do not provide thermal protection to the pulp. Based on the information provided, the correct answer is B. Suspension Liners (25-30 \u03bcm), as they are specifically designed to provide thermal protection to the pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
