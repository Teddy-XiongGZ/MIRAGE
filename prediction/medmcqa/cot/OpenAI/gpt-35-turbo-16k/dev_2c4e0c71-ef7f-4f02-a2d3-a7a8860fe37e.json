    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a condition where there is a defect in the diaphragm, allowing abdominal organs to herniate into the chest cavity. Prognosis in CDH depends on various factors. Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication in CDH and can significantly impact prognosis. It is characterized by increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and poor oxygenation. The size of the hernia can also affect prognosis, as larger defects may result in more severe respiratory compromise. Timing of surgery is important in CDH, as early surgical repair can help prevent further lung damage and improve outcomes. Lastly, gestational age at birth can influence prognosis, as premature infants may have underdeveloped lungs and other complications. Considering all these factors, the most important prognostic factor in congenital diaphragmatic hernia is likely A. Pulmonary hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
