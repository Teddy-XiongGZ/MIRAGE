    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of continuing or changing anti-epileptic medications. Sodium valproate is known to have a higher risk of fetal malformations and developmental delays compared to other anti-epileptic drugs. Therefore, it is generally recommended to avoid valproate if possible. In this case, since the patient is requesting a change in her treatment, it is important to consider alternative options that are safer for the fetus. Lamotrigine is considered a safer option during pregnancy and can be used as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-epileptic drugs. Carbamazepine is also an option, but it has a higher risk of fetal malformations compared to lamotrigine. Continuing valproate and serial drug monitoring in blood is not recommended due to the known risks associated with valproate use during pregnancy. Therefore, the best option in this case would be to add lamotrigine to valproate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Add lamotrigine to valproate\"}"
