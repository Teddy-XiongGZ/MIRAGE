    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If a patient is not responding to multiple platelet transfusions, it suggests that there may be an underlying issue causing the lack of response. One possible cause could be an immune reaction against the transfused platelets. In such cases, HLA matched platelets may be the best treatment option.

Therefore, the best treatment option in this scenario would be C. HLA matched platelet.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
