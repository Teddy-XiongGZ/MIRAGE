    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Repeated fracture of a porcelain fused to metal restoration can be caused by various factors. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Occlusal trauma: Excessive forces on the restoration due to grinding or clenching can lead to fractures, but it is not the primary cause.\\n\\nB. Inadequately designed framework: If the framework is not properly designed or lacks sufficient support, it can contribute to fractures, but it is not the primary cause.\\n\\nC. Improper firing schedule: This refers to the process of heating the restoration to fuse the porcelain to the metal. If the firing schedule is not followed correctly, it can result in weak bonding and increased risk of fractures. This is a possible primary cause.\\n\\nD. Failure to use metal conditioner: Metal conditioners are used to enhance the bond between the metal and porcelain. If they are not used, it can weaken the bond and increase the likelihood of fractures. This is also a possible primary cause.\\n\\nConsidering the options, both C and D are potential primary causes of repeated fracture of a porcelain fused to metal restoration. However, based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine which one is the primary cause. Therefore, the answer choice cannot be definitively determined.\", \"answer_choice\": \"Cannot be determined\"}"
