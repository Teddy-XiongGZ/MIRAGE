    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this case, the patient has lower natural teeth and 7 maxillary implants placed. The space available for restoration is 15 mm. Based on this information, we can consider the following options:\\n\\n1. Single crown and bridge screw retained: This option involves placing individual crowns on the natural teeth and a bridge supported by the implants. However, the space available may not be sufficient for a screw-retained bridge.\\n\\n2. Single crown and bridge cement retained: This option also involves placing individual crowns on the natural teeth and a bridge supported by the implants. Cement-retained restorations may be more suitable in cases where there is limited space.\\n\\n3. Overdenture: This option involves placing a removable denture that is supported by the implants. It provides stability and retention, but may not be the ideal choice if the patient desires a fixed prosthesis.\\n\\n4. Hybrid denture: This option involves placing a fixed prosthesis that is supported by the implants. It provides excellent stability and aesthetics, but may require more space than available.\\n\\nConsidering the available space of 15 mm, the most suitable treatment plan would be option C. Overdenture, as it provides stability and retention while utilizing the limited space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
