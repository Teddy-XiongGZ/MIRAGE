    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the mean and standard deviation, we need to have numerical data. Nominal scale and ordinal scale do not provide numerical values, so they cannot be used to calculate mean and standard deviation. Dichotomous scale only has two categories, so it also does not provide enough data for calculating mean and standard deviation. Interval/ratio scale, on the other hand, provides numerical values with equal intervals between them, which allows us to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Interval/Ratio scale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
