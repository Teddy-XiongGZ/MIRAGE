    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The quadruple test is a prenatal screening test used to assess the risk of Down syndrome in a fetus. It measures four markers in the mother's blood: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and inhibin A. The test combines the results of these markers with the mother's age to estimate the risk of Down syndrome. Therefore, the marker that is not used in the quadruple test for antenatal detection of Down syndrome is Estradiol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
