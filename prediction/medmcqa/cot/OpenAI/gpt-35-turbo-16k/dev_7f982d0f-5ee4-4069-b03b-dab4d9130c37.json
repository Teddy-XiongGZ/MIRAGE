    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material can occur in different ways. Trisomy 21 is the most common cause of Down syndrome, where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 in every cell. Mosaicism of chromosome 21 occurs when some cells have the extra copy of chromosome 21, while others do not. Robertsonian translocation involves the fusion of chromosome 21 with another chromosome, typically chromosome 14. This can result in an extra copy of chromosome 21. Deletion of chromosome 21, where a portion of chromosome 21 is missing, is not a cause of Down syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Deletion of 21.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
