    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the wave pattern, we need to understand the characteristics of each wave pattern. \\n\\nEEG (Electroencephalogram) measures brain activity. In NREM sleep, the brain waves are typically slow and high in amplitude. In REM sleep, the brain waves resemble wakefulness with low amplitude and fast frequency. In wakefulness, the brain waves are typically fast and low in amplitude. In quiet wakefulness, the brain waves are similar to wakefulness but with slightly slower frequency and higher amplitude. \\n\\nECG (Electrocardiogram) measures heart activity. The wave pattern in NREM sleep and REM sleep is usually irregular and variable. In wakefulness and quiet wakefulness, the heart rate is typically regular. \\n\\nEMG (Electromyogram) measures muscle activity. In NREM sleep, the muscle activity is typically low. In REM sleep, the muscle activity is usually absent or minimal. In wakefulness and quiet wakefulness, the muscle activity is usually present. \\n\\nBased on these characteristics, we can determine the wave pattern by comparing the given wave pattern with the characteristics of each sleep stage. \\n\\nUnfortunately, without the provided figure, it is not possible to determine the wave pattern. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
