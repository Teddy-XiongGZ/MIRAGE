    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the most common functional tumors of the endocrine pancreas. Functional tumors are those that produce hormones. To determine the answer, we need to consider the prevalence of each tumor type. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Vipoma: Vipomas are tumors that produce vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). They are rare and not considered the most common functional tumors of the endocrine pancreas.\\n\\nB. Gastrinoma: Gastrinomas are tumors that produce gastrin. They are associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and are one of the most common functional tumors of the endocrine pancreas.\\n\\nC. Glucagonoma: Glucagonomas are tumors that produce glucagon. They are rare and not considered the most common functional tumors of the endocrine pancreas.\\n\\nD. Somatostatinoma: Somatostatinomas are tumors that produce somatostatin. They are rare and not considered the most common functional tumors of the endocrine pancreas.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the most common functional tumor of the endocrine pancreas is B. Gastrinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
