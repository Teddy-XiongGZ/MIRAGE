    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stiffness refers to the resistance of a material to elastic deformation. Elastic deformation is the temporary change in shape or size of a material when a force is applied to it, and it returns to its original shape when the force is removed. Stiffness is not related to plastic deformation, which is a permanent change in shape or size of a material. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Resistance to elastic deformation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
