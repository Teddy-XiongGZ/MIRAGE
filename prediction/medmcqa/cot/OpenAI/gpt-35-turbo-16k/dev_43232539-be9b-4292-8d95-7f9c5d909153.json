    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In arthroscopy, for TMJ adhesion lysis, the laser used is typically an Er-Yag laser. The Er-Yag laser is commonly used in dentistry and oral surgery procedures, including TMJ adhesion lysis. It is known for its ability to precisely remove tissue and vaporize adhesions without causing excessive thermal damage. The Ho-Yag laser is commonly used in urology and ophthalmology procedures, but it is not typically used for TMJ adhesion lysis. The He-Ne laser is a low-power laser used for therapeutic purposes, such as pain management, and is not suitable for tissue ablation. The Argon laser is commonly used in dermatology and ophthalmology procedures, but it is not typically used for TMJ adhesion lysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Er-Yag\"}"
