    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the range in which 95% of the population would be lying, we need to calculate the confidence interval. The formula for the confidence interval is: mean \u00b1 (Z * standard deviation), where Z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence level, the z-score is approximately 1.96. So, the range would be: 25 \u00b1 (1.96 * 10) = 25 \u00b1 19.6 = 5.4 to 44.6 mm Hg. However, we need to find the range in which 10% of the population would be lying. To do this, we need to divide the confidence interval by 2. So, the range in which 10% of the population would be lying is: 5.4/2 to 44.6/2 = 2.7 to 22.3 mm Hg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 22-28 mm Hg\"}"
