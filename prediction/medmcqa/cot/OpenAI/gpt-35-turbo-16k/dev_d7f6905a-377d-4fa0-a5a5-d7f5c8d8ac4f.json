    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The empty thecal sac sign refers to the absence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the thecal sac on imaging studies. This can be seen in conditions that cause compression or displacement of the thecal sac. Let's consider each option:\\n\\nA. Arachnoiditis: Arachnoiditis is inflammation of the arachnoid membrane, which can cause scarring and adhesions. While it can lead to thecal sac compression, it does not typically cause an empty thecal sac sign.\\n\\nB. Tethered Cord syndrome: Tethered Cord syndrome occurs when the spinal cord is abnormally attached to surrounding tissues, causing tension and stretching. This can lead to thecal sac compression, but it does not typically cause an empty thecal sac sign.\\n\\nC. Vertebral osteomyelitis: Vertebral osteomyelitis is an infection of the vertebral body. While it can cause thecal sac compression, it does not typically cause an empty thecal sac sign.\\n\\nD. Discitis: Discitis is inflammation or infection of the intervertebral disc. It can cause thecal sac compression, but it does not typically cause an empty thecal sac sign. \\n\\nBased on this information, the most likely answer is A. Arachnoiditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
