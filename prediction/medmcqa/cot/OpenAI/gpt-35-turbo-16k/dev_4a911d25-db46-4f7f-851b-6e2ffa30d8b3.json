    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When bone is subjected to compression, it is important to consider the components that resist this force. The protein component of bone, which includes collagen, provides flexibility and tensile strength. The lipid component of bone, which includes adipocytes, primarily serves as a source of energy and insulation. The mineral component of bone, which includes calcium and phosphate, provides rigidity and compressive strength. Considering these factors, the component of bone that primarily resists compression is the collagen component, which is part of the protein component.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
