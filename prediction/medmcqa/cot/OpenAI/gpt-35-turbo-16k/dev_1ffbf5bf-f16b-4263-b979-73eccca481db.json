    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The incidence of 2 canals in mandibular incisors refers to the percentage of mandibular incisors that have two root canals instead of the usual single canal. To determine the answer, we need to consider the available options. Option A states that the incidence is 3 - 12%. This means that between 3% and 12% of mandibular incisors have two canals. Option B states that the incidence is 12 - 20%. This means that between 12% and 20% of mandibular incisors have two canals. Option C states that the incidence is 20 - 41%. This means that between 20% and 41% of mandibular incisors have two canals. Option D states that the incidence is less than 3%. This means that less than 3% of mandibular incisors have two canals. Based on these options, the most accurate answer is option D, as it states that the incidence is less than 3%. This suggests that the occurrence of two canals in mandibular incisors is relatively rare.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
