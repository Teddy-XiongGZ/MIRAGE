    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The reverse bevel incision is a type of incision used in periodontal surgery. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Allow atraumatic reflection of the gingival margin: The reverse bevel incision is not specifically designed to allow atraumatic reflection of the gingival margin. This option is unlikely.\\n\\nB. Remove the infected tissue in the sulcus: The reverse bevel incision is not primarily used for removing infected tissue in the sulcus. This option is unlikely.\\n\\nC. Provide access to the alveolar crest: The reverse bevel incision is commonly used to provide access to the alveolar crest during periodontal surgery. This option is likely.\\n\\nD. All of the above: Since options A and B are unlikely, the correct answer is C. The reverse bevel incision is made to provide access to the alveolar crest.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
