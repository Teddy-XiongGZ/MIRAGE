    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The contractile part of intrafusal fibers refers to the portion of the muscle fibers that can actively contract. Intrafusal fibers are specialized muscle fibers found within muscle spindles, which are sensory organs involved in detecting changes in muscle length and tension. The contractile part of intrafusal fibers is responsible for generating tension within the muscle spindle, allowing it to respond to changes in muscle length. Based on this information, the contractile part of intrafusal fibers can be found at both the center and the ends of the fibers. Therefore, the answer is D. Both.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
