    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A high-risk infant refers to a baby who has a higher chance of experiencing health problems or complications compared to a typical newborn. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is considered a high-risk factor. \\n\\nA. Mal-presentation: Mal-presentation refers to the abnormal positioning of the baby in the womb, such as breech or transverse presentation. While mal-presentation can increase the risk of complications during delivery, it does not necessarily make the infant high-risk after birth. \\n\\nB. Folic acid tablet not consumed: Folic acid is important for the development of the baby's neural tube and can help prevent certain birth defects. However, not consuming folic acid tablets does not automatically classify an infant as high-risk. \\n\\nC. Working mother: Being born to a working mother does not inherently make an infant high-risk. The mother's occupation does not directly impact the baby's health or risk level. \\n\\nD. Antenatal preeclampsia: Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure and organ damage during pregnancy. Antenatal preeclampsia can increase the risk of complications for both the mother and the baby, making the infant high-risk. \\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is D. Antenatal preeclampsia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
