    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardiolipin is a unique phospholipid that is primarily found in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is not found in other cellular membranes. Therefore, option A is true. Cardiolipin is also known to play a role in the process of apoptosis, which is programmed cell death. This is because cardiolipin is involved in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which triggers the apoptotic cascade. Therefore, option B is also true. Cardiolipin is a diphosphatidyl glycerol, meaning it has two phosphate groups attached to the glycerol backbone. Therefore, option C is true. Lastly, cardiolipin does not have a choline base with a labile methyl group. Instead, it has a phosphatidylglycerol base. Therefore, option D is false. Hence, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
