    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the minimum sample size required for the study, we can use the formula for sample size calculation for estimating proportions. The formula is given by: n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2, where n is the sample size, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, p is the expected prevalence, and E is the desired margin of error. In this case, the Z-score corresponding to a 95% confidence level is approximately 1.96. The expected prevalence is 50% or 0.5, and the desired margin of error is (55% - 45%) / 2 = 0.05. Plugging these values into the formula, we get n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1-0.5)) / 0.05^2 = 384.16. Since we need a whole number for the sample size, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 385.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 400\"}"
