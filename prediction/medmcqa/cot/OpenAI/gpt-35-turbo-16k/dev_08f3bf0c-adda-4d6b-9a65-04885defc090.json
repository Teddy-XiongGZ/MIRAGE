    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In prokaryotes, the binding of mRNA with ribosome is facilitated by a specific sequence called the Shine Dalgarno sequence. This sequence is found in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA and is complementary to a sequence on the small ribosomal subunit. The Shine Dalgarno sequence helps in positioning the ribosome correctly on the mRNA for translation to occur. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Shine Dalgarno sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
