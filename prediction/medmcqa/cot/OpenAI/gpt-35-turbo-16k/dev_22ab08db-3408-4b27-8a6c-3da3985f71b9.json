    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes occurs during meiosis, which is the process of cell division that produces gametes (sperm or eggs). In males, meiosis occurs during spermatocyte maturation. Step 1: Spermatogonia are the diploid cells that undergo mitosis to produce primary spermatocytes. Step 2: Primary spermatocytes are diploid cells that undergo the first meiotic division (meiosis I) to produce secondary spermatocytes. Step 3: Secondary spermatocytes are haploid cells that undergo the second meiotic division (meiosis II) to produce spermatids. Step 4: Spermatids are haploid cells that undergo further maturation to form spermatozoa (sperm). During the first meiotic division (meiosis I), independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes occurs. This is the stage where homologous chromosomes separate and are randomly distributed into different daughter cells. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocyte.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
