    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pyrexia of unknown origin refers to a persistent fever of unknown cause. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Diagnosis requires fever persisting for 3 weeks: This is a characteristic feature of pyrexia of unknown origin. If the fever persists for 3 weeks or more, it can be considered as pyrexia of unknown origin.\\n\\nB. Fever undiagnosed after 1 week of in-patient workup: This is also a characteristic feature of pyrexia of unknown origin. If the fever remains undiagnosed after a thorough workup in the hospital for 1 week, it can be considered as pyrexia of unknown origin.\\n\\nC. Absence of immunological compromise: This is not a requirement for the diagnosis of pyrexia of unknown origin. Immunological compromise is not directly related to the definition of pyrexia of unknown origin.\\n\\nD. Temperature of 38.3degC or more: This is not a requirement for the diagnosis of pyrexia of unknown origin. The definition of pyrexia of unknown origin is based on the duration of fever and the inability to identify the cause, not on a specific temperature threshold.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is C. Absence of immunological compromise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
