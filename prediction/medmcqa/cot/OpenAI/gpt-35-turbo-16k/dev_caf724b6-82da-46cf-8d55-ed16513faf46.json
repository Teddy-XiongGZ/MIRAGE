    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine in which of the following tumors MRI is better than CT scan, we need to consider the characteristics of each tumor and the strengths of MRI and CT scan. MRI is generally better than CT scan for imaging soft tissues, while CT scan is better for imaging bony structures and detecting calcifications. \\n\\nA. Brochogenic Carcinoma: Both MRI and CT scan can be used to evaluate brochogenic carcinoma, but CT scan is generally preferred due to its ability to detect calcifications and evaluate the extent of the tumor.\\n\\nB. SCC of lung: Both MRI and CT scan can be used to evaluate SCC of lung, but CT scan is generally preferred due to its ability to detect calcifications and evaluate the extent of the tumor.\\n\\nC. Mesothelioma: MRI is generally better than CT scan for imaging mesothelioma, as it provides better visualization of the soft tissues and can help in assessing the extent of the tumor.\\n\\nD. Pancost tumor: MRI is generally better than CT scan for imaging Pancost tumor, as it provides better visualization of the soft tissues and can help in assessing the extent of the tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
