    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prolong the life of an all ceramic crown placed on a mandibular canine, we need to consider the following factors: 1. Glazing: Glazing is the process of applying a layer of glass-like material to the surface of the crown. This can help improve the aesthetics and smoothness of the crown, but it may not directly contribute to the longevity of the crown. 2. Polishing: Polishing the crown can help to remove any rough surfaces or irregularities, which can reduce the risk of plaque accumulation and improve the overall longevity of the crown. 3. Out of occlusion (Infraocclusion): Placing the crown out of occlusion, also known as infraocclusion, can help to reduce the forces and stresses placed on the crown during biting and chewing. This can help to minimize the risk of fracture or damage to the crown. 4. Group function: Group function refers to the occlusal contact of multiple teeth in a group during biting and chewing. This can distribute the forces more evenly and reduce the stress on individual teeth, including the crown. However, it may not directly contribute to the longevity of the crown. Considering these factors, the most appropriate choice to prolong the life of the crown would be C. Out of occlusion (Infraocclusion).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
