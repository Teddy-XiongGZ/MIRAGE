    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A lipoprotein is a complex particle that transports lipids in the bloodstream. It consists of a core of hydrophobic lipids, such as cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, surrounded by a shell of hydrophilic lipids, such as phospholipids and free cholesterol. The shell also contains proteins called apoproteins, which help in the stabilization and function of the lipoprotein. Therefore, the lipoprotein contains free cholesterol and phospholipids at the periphery, cholesteryl ester and fatty acids at the center, and proteins as apoproteins. Hence, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
