    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enamel rods are cylindrical structures that make up the enamel layer of the tooth. They are formed by the mineralization of enamel matrix proteins. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is false. \\n\\nA. They are perpendicular to tooth surface: This statement is true. Enamel rods are oriented perpendicular to the tooth surface.\\n\\nB. They are parallel to each other: This statement is true. Enamel rods are arranged in parallel to each other.\\n\\nC. Diameter of enamel rods is 30 micrometers at DEJ: This statement is true. The diameter of enamel rods is approximately 30 micrometers at the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ).\\n\\nD. Diameter of enamel rod is 5 micrometers at DEJ: This statement is false. The diameter of enamel rods is not 5 micrometers at the DEJ. \\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the false statement about enamel rods is D. Diameter of enamel rod is 5 micrometer at DEJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
