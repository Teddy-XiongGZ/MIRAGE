    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Teeth with fluorosis have an increased mineral content, which makes them more resistant to acid etching. However, it is still possible to etch fluorotic teeth, although a longer etching time may be required. The etching time for teeth with fluorosis is typically longer than for normal teeth. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 60-90 sec.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
