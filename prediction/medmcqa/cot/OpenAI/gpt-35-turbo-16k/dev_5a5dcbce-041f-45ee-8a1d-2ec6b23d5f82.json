    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome, which means that he requires long-term treatment with corticosteroids. However, the patient is already markedly cushingoid, which is a side effect of corticosteroid therapy. Therefore, continuing long-term corticosteroid therapy may not be the best option. The patient also has elevated blood pressure, which may be due to the corticosteroid therapy. Small subcapsular cataracts are also a known side effect of corticosteroid therapy. Given these findings, the most appropriate therapy of choice would be to try an alternative treatment that can reduce the need for corticosteroids. Among the options provided, the most suitable choice would be B. Cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent that can be used in steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome to reduce the need for corticosteroids and induce remission. It is often used in combination with corticosteroids to achieve better outcomes. Therefore, the answer choice is B. Cyclophosphamide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
