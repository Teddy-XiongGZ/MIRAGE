    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When loading the fracture mandible posterior to the site of fracture, the force is applied in a direction opposite to the normal anatomical alignment. This means that the force is directed from the posterior towards the anterior. Let's analyze the potential choices: A. Tension on upper border: When a force is applied in the opposite direction, tension is not expected on the upper border. B. Compression on upper border: Since the force is applied from posterior to anterior, there will be compression on the upper border. C. Compression on medial surface: The force is not directed towards the medial surface, so compression is not expected on the medial surface. D. Compression on inferior surface: The force is not directed towards the inferior surface, so compression is not expected on the inferior surface. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Compression on upper border.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
