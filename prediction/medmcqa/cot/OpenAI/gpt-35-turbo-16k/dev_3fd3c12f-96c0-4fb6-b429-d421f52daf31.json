    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Robinson's classification of ameloblastoma is a widely accepted classification system for this type of tumor. It categorizes ameloblastomas based on their behavior and clinical features. To determine which option is not included in Robinson's classification, we need to understand what each option represents. A. Multicentric: This refers to the presence of multiple tumor sites in different locations. B. Non-functional: This refers to tumors that do not produce any functional or active substances. C. Anatomically benign: This refers to tumors that are not invasive and do not spread to surrounding tissues. D. Clinically persistent: This refers to tumors that do not regress or disappear over time. Now, let's compare these options to Robinson's classification. Robinson's classification includes different subtypes of ameloblastoma based on their behavior and clinical features, such as unicystic, multicystic, peripheral, and desmoplastic. However, it does not specifically include the term 'multicentric' in its classification. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Multicentric.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
