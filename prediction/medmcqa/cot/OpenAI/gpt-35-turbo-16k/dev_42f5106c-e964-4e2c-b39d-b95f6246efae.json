    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a technique that uses RNA as the starting material. It involves the sequencing of RNA molecules to determine their sequence and identify any variations or mutations. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a technique used to amplify DNA, not RNA. Sanger's technique, also known as Sanger sequencing, is a method for DNA sequencing, not RNA sequencing. Western blotting is a technique used to detect specific proteins, not RNA. Therefore, the primarily RNA based technique among the given options is Next generation sequencing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
