    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Guiding planes on abutment teeth are designed to provide specific functions. Let's evaluate each option to determine the correct answer. \\n\\nA. Predictable clasp retention: Guiding planes do not directly affect clasp retention. \\nB. Increased resistance towards horizontal movement: Guiding planes can help resist horizontal movement by providing a stable surface for the prosthesis. \\nC. Transmit forces along the long axis of the tooth: This is one of the main functions of guiding planes. They help direct forces along the long axis of the tooth, which is important for proper force distribution. \\nD. Guides the key into the keyway: This option is not related to guiding planes on abutment teeth. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Transmit forces along the long axis of the tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
