    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a common respiratory disorder in newborns, characterized by tachypnea (rapid breathing) shortly after birth. To determine the radiological features of TTN, we need to consider the typical findings associated with this condition. 1. Reticulogranular appearance: This refers to a fine, granular pattern seen on chest radiographs. It is not a characteristic feature of TTN. 2. Low volume lungs: TTN is often associated with retained fetal lung fluid, which can result in lung overinflation and a hyperexpanded appearance on chest radiographs. Therefore, low volume lungs are not a characteristic feature of TTN. 3. Prominent horizontal fissure: The horizontal fissure is a normal anatomical structure in the lungs and is not typically affected by TTN. Therefore, a prominent horizontal fissure is not a characteristic radiological feature of TTN. 4. Air bronchogram: An air bronchogram refers to the visualization of air-filled bronchi against a background of consolidated lung tissue. This finding is not typically seen in TTN. Based on the above analysis, none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) are characteristic radiological features of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN).\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
