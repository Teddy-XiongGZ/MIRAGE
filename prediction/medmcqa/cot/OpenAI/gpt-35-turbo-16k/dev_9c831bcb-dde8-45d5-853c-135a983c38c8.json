    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the relation between the variances of Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Vitamin D, we need to compare their respective standard deviations (SD). The variance is equal to the square of the standard deviation. Given that the SD of DBP is 11 mm Hg and the SD of Vitamin D is 3 ng/ml, we can calculate the variances by squaring these values. The variance of DBP would be 11^2 = 121 mm Hg^2, and the variance of Vitamin D would be 3^2 = 9 ng/ml^2. Comparing these variances, we can conclude that the variance of DBP is greater than the variance of Vitamin D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
