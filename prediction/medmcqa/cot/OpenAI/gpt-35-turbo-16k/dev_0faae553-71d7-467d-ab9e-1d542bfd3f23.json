    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The AO system of fixation is a classification system used in orthopedic surgery to guide the selection of appropriate implants and techniques for fracture fixation. When adequate bone buttressing is present, the AO system suggests load sharing fixation. Load sharing fixation involves the use of implants that allow for some degree of load transmission through the fracture site, while also providing stability and support. This allows the bone to bear some of the load during the healing process. Compression osteogenesis, on the other hand, involves the application of controlled compression across a fracture site to stimulate bone healing. Load bearing fixation refers to the use of implants that bear the majority of the load, providing immediate stability and support. Non-rigid fixation refers to the use of implants that allow for some degree of movement at the fracture site. Given that the question states that adequate bone buttressing is present, load sharing fixation would be the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Load sharing fixation\"}"
