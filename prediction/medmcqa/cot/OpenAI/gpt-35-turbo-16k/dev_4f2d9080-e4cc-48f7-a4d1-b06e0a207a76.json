    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best investigation to prove rheumatic etiology, we need to consider the possible causes of the symptoms. In this case, Sydenham's chorea and acute rheumatic fever are suspected. Rheumatic fever is often caused by a preceding streptococcal infection, so we need to look for evidence of a recent streptococcal infection. Option C, throat culture, would be useful if there was evidence of a sore throat, but in this case, there is no evidence of sore throat. Option D, PCR for M protein, is not the best choice because it is specific for detecting the presence of Group A Streptococcus, but it does not directly indicate a recent streptococcal infection. The most appropriate choice would be either option A, Antistreptolysin S, or option B, Antistreptolysin O. Both of these tests measure the presence of antibodies against streptolysin, a toxin produced by Group A Streptococcus. However, Antistreptolysin O is more commonly used and has higher sensitivity. Therefore, the best investigation to prove rheumatic etiology in this case would be option B, Antistreptolysin O.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
