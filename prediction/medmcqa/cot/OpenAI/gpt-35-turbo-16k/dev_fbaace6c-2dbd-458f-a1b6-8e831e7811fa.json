    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vasomotor reversal of Dale refers to the phenomenon where the response to a drug changes from vasoconstriction to vasodilation. This occurs when a drug that initially causes vasoconstriction is followed by a drug that causes vasodilation. Let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. Propranolol followed by adrenaline: Propranolol is a beta-blocker that causes vasodilation, while adrenaline (epinephrine) causes vasoconstriction. This combination does not depict vasomotor reversal of Dale. \\n\\nB. Propranolol followed by noradrenaline: Propranolol followed by noradrenaline would result in vasoconstriction followed by vasoconstriction, so it does not depict vasomotor reversal of Dale. \\n\\nC. Decrease in heart rate on adrenaline administration after phentolamine has been given: Phentolamine is an alpha-blocker that causes vasodilation. If adrenaline is administered after phentolamine, the vasoconstrictive effects of adrenaline would be blocked, resulting in vasodilation. This depicts vasomotor reversal of Dale. \\n\\nD. Noradrenaline followed by propranolol: Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) causes vasoconstriction, and propranolol causes vasodilation. This combination does not depict vasomotor reversal of Dale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
