    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the CT scan findings, we need to analyze the location and appearance of the hemorrhage. Extradural hemorrhage typically appears as a biconvex or lens-shaped collection of blood between the skull and the dura mater. Subdural hemorrhage appears as a crescent-shaped collection of blood between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater. Intracerebral hemorrhage appears as a localized collection of blood within the brain tissue. Subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as diffuse blood within the subarachnoid space. Looking at the CT scan, we can see a crescent-shaped collection of blood between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis based on the findings in the CT scan is B. Subdural hemorrhage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
