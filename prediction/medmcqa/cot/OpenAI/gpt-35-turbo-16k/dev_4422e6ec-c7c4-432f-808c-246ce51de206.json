    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The initial clicking of TMJ while opening can be caused by various factors. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Protruded condyle in respect to articular disc: If the condyle is protruded in relation to the articular disc, it can cause clicking sounds during jaw movement.\\n\\nB. Retruded condyle in respect to articular disc: If the condyle is retruded in relation to the articular disc, it can also cause clicking sounds during jaw movement.\\n\\nC. Perforated disc: A perforated disc refers to a tear or hole in the articular disc. While it can cause pain and other symptoms, it may not necessarily cause clicking sounds.\\n\\nD. Lateral displacement of the condyle: If the condyle is laterally displaced, it can cause clicking sounds during jaw movement.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, options A, B, and D are all possible causes of the initial clicking of TMJ while opening. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact cause. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/D\"}"
