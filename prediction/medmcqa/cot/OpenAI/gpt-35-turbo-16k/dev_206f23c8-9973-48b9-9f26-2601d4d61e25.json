    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The main cause of RPD (Removable Partial Denture) failure can be determined by considering the potential factors that contribute to its failure. 1. Improper clasp design: Clasps are the components of RPDs that provide retention and stability. If the clasp design is improper, it may not provide adequate retention and stability, leading to RPD failure. 2. Insufficient contact of teeth: The success of an RPD depends on the proper distribution of occlusal forces. If there is insufficient contact between the RPD and the remaining natural teeth, it can result in uneven distribution of forces, leading to RPD failure. 3. Insufficient contact of teeth and improper clasp design: It is possible that both insufficient contact of teeth and improper clasp design can contribute to RPD failure. If there is a combination of these factors, the RPD may not function properly and may fail. Considering these factors, the correct answer is C. Insufficient contact of teeth and improper clasp design.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
