    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of blood transfusion. It is characterized by the sudden onset of acute respiratory distress within 6 hours of transfusion. TRALI is caused by an immune response to transfused blood components, resulting in inflammation and increased permeability of the pulmonary capillary endothelium. The correct answer is D. Plasma is more likely to cause TRALI than whole blood. TRALI is most commonly associated with transfusion of plasma-containing blood products, such as fresh frozen plasma or platelets. Whole blood transfusion is less likely to cause TRALI as it contains fewer plasma components.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
