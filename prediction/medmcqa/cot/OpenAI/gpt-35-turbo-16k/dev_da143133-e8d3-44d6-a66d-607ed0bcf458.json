    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Perioral tingling and numbness after apheresis for platelet donation can be attributed to several factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. His platelet count was low for donation: Low platelet count would not directly cause perioral tingling and numbness.\\n\\nB. He underwent apheresis for the first time: This is a possible cause as first-time donors may experience side effects due to the procedure.\\n\\nC. Due to fluid depletion: Fluid depletion can cause symptoms like dizziness or lightheadedness, but it is less likely to cause perioral tingling and numbness specifically.\\n\\nD. Due to citrate-based anticoagulant: Citrate is commonly used as an anticoagulant during apheresis procedures. It can bind to calcium, leading to a decrease in ionized calcium levels, which can cause perioral tingling and numbness.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the most likely cause of perioral tingling and numbness in this case is D. Due to citrate-based anticoagulant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
