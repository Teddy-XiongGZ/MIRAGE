    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transudate and exudate are two types of fluids that can accumulate in body cavities or tissues. Transudate is a fluid that is formed due to an imbalance in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures, resulting in the passive filtration of plasma across capillary walls. Exudate, on the other hand, is a fluid that is formed due to inflammation or injury, resulting in an active process of fluid and protein leakage from blood vessels. To determine the difference between transudate and exudate, we can consider the characteristics of each type of fluid. Transudate is typically formed under normal physiological conditions and has a low protein content. This is because the filtration of plasma across capillary walls in transudate formation does not involve significant protein leakage. Based on this information, the answer choice that best describes the difference in transudate and exudate is A. Low protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
