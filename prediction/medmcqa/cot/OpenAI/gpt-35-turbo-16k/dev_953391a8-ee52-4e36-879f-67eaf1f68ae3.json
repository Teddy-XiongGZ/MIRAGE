    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The masticatory forces in the oral cavity are primarily taken up by the periodontal ligament fibers. These fibers are classified into different groups based on their orientation. The alveolar crest fibers run from the alveolar crest to the cementum, while the oblique fibers run from the alveolar bone obliquely to the cementum. The horizontal fibers run horizontally from the alveolar bone to the cementum, and the apical fibers run from the apex of the tooth to the cementum. Considering the question, the maximum masticatory forces are likely taken up by the oblique fibers, as they are oriented in a way that can resist the forces exerted during chewing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
