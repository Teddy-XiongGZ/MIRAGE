    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Feedforward control is a mechanism in which the body anticipates a change and prepares for it by adjusting hormone levels. To determine which hormone is controlled by feedforward control, we need to consider the function of each hormone and whether it is involved in anticipatory responses. A. ADH (antidiuretic hormone) is released by the pituitary gland and helps regulate water balance in the body. It is primarily controlled by negative feedback mechanisms, not feedforward control. B. Insulin is produced by the pancreas and helps regulate blood sugar levels. It is primarily controlled by negative feedback mechanisms, not feedforward control. C. Corticosteroids are a group of hormones produced by the adrenal glands. They have various functions, including regulating metabolism and immune responses. Corticosteroids are primarily controlled by negative feedback mechanisms, not feedforward control. D. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland and is involved in milk production. Prolactin levels are primarily controlled by feedforward control. During pregnancy, prolactin levels increase in anticipation of the demands of breastfeeding. Based on this information, the hormone that is controlled by feedforward control is D. Prolactin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
