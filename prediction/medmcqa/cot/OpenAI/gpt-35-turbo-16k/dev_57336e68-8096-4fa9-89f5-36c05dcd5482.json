    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which mixed dentition analysis of deciduous dentition does not use radiographs, we need to review each option. \\n\\nA. Carey's analysis: Carey's analysis does not require radiographs as it is based on the measurement of the widths of the primary canines and molars.\\n\\nB. Moyer's analysis: Moyer's analysis does involve the use of radiographs to measure the mesiodistal widths of the permanent incisors and canines.\\n\\nC. Nance Carey's analysis: Nance Carey's analysis also requires radiographs to measure the mesiodistal widths of the permanent incisors and canines.\\n\\nD. Pont's index: Pont's index is used to determine the space available for the permanent canines and does not involve the use of radiographs. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is D. Pont's index.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
