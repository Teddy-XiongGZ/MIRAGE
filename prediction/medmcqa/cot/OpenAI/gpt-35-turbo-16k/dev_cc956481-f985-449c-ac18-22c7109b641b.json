    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To measure variation between two different units, we need to consider the spread or dispersion of the data. The variance is a measure of how spread out the data is, but it is not specifically designed to compare variation between different units. The standard deviation is also a measure of spread, but it is the square root of the variance and is expressed in the same units as the data, making it more suitable for comparing variation between different units. The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, and it is used to compare variation relative to the mean. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset, but it does not provide a measure of variation between different units. Therefore, the most appropriate choice for measuring variation between two different units is B. Standard deviation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
