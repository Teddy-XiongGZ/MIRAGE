    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hormones can act on target cells through different mechanisms. Some hormones bind to receptors on the cell surface and activate intracellular signaling pathways, while others can cross the plasma membrane and directly interact with intracellular receptors. To determine which hormone crosses the plasma membrane for its action, we need to consider the characteristics of each hormone listed. Epinephrine, glucagon, and insulin are all peptide hormones, which typically bind to cell surface receptors. Thyroxine, on the other hand, is a thyroid hormone and is known to cross the plasma membrane to bind to intracellular receptors. Therefore, the hormone that crosses the plasma membrane for its action is Thyroxine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
