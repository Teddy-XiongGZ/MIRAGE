    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myocardial infarction refers to the death of heart muscle tissue due to a lack of blood supply. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Ischemia caused by dynamic obstruction of a coronary artery: This option suggests that the obstruction of a coronary artery is dynamic, meaning it can change over time. However, in myocardial infarction, the obstruction is usually acute and complete, leading to the death of heart muscle tissue. \\n\\nB. Myocardial necrosis caused by acute occlusion of a coronary artery: This option suggests that the major pathology in myocardial infarction is the acute occlusion of a coronary artery, leading to the death of heart muscle tissue. This aligns with the definition of myocardial infarction.\\n\\nC. Ischemia due to fixed atheromatous stenosis of one or more coronary arteries: This option suggests that the major pathology is the fixed atheromatous stenosis of one or more coronary arteries, leading to ischemia. While atherosclerosis can contribute to the development of myocardial infarction, the major pathology is the acute occlusion of a coronary artery.\\n\\nD. Altered conduction due to ischemia or infarction: This option suggests that the major pathology is altered conduction due to ischemia or infarction. While altered conduction can occur in myocardial infarction, it is not the primary pathology. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. Myocardial necrosis caused by acute occlusion of a coronary artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
