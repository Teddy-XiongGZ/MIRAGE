    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The formocresol pulpotomy is a dental procedure that involves the use of formocresol, a medication used to treat dental pulp infections. In this case, the patient returned with a large ulcer near the midline of the lower lip on the day following the pulpotomy. To determine the probable cause of the ulcer, we need to consider the possible factors that could have contributed to its development. A. Lip biting by the patient: Lip biting can cause ulcers, but it is less likely to be the cause in this case since the ulcer appeared on the day following the pulpotomy. B. Allergy to the anaesthetic solution: Allergic reactions to anesthetic solutions can cause various symptoms, including swelling, redness, and itching. However, an allergic reaction to the anesthetic solution is less likely to cause a large ulcer near the midline of the lower lip. C. Pressure by the rubber dam frame: The rubber dam frame is used to isolate the tooth during the pulpotomy procedure. While pressure from the rubber dam frame can cause discomfort, it is unlikely to cause a large ulcer near the midline of the lower lip. D. Leakage of formocresol on the lip: Formocresol is a strong medication that can cause tissue damage if it comes into contact with the skin or mucous membranes. In this case, the presence of a large ulcer near the midline of the lower lip suggests that there may have been a leakage of formocresol on the lip during the pulpotomy procedure. Based on the information provided, the most probable cause of the ulcer is D. Leakage of formocresol on the lip.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
