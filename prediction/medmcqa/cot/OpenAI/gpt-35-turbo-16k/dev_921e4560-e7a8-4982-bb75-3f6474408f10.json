    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Shock is a condition characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. It can be caused by various factors, such as hypovolemia, cardiogenic dysfunction, or systemic vasodilation. To determine which of the options is common to all types of shock, we need to consider the pathophysiology of shock. Vasoconstriction is a common response in all types of shock as the body tries to redirect blood flow to vital organs. Hypotension is also a common feature of shock, as the inadequate tissue perfusion leads to decreased blood pressure. Sepsis, on the other hand, is a specific type of shock caused by a severe infection and may not be present in all types of shock. Bradycardia is not a common feature of shock, as the body typically responds with tachycardia to compensate for the decreased tissue perfusion. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Vasoconstriction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
