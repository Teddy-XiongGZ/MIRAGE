    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which stage of Plasmodium vivax is infective to mosquitoes, we need to understand the life cycle of the parasite. Plasmodium vivax is a species of malaria parasite that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The life cycle of Plasmodium vivax involves several stages, including sporozoite, gametocyte, merozoite, and zygote. The sporozoite stage occurs when the mosquito injects the parasite into a human host during a blood meal. Sporozoites are the infective stage of the parasite and they travel to the liver, where they invade liver cells and multiply. The gametocyte stage occurs after the parasite has multiplied in the liver. Gametocytes are the sexual stage of the parasite and they circulate in the bloodstream. When a mosquito bites an infected human, it ingests the gametocytes along with the blood. The merozoite stage occurs when the mosquito ingests the gametocytes. Inside the mosquito, the gametocytes mature and undergo sexual reproduction, forming zygotes. The zygote stage occurs when the male and female gametes fuse to form a zygote. The zygote develops into an ookinete, which penetrates the mosquito's midgut wall and develops into an oocyst. The oocyst then releases sporozoites, which migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands and can be transmitted to another human during a subsequent blood meal. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Sporozoite, as it is the stage of Plasmodium vivax that is infective to mosquitoes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
