    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process described in the question involves examining the shape, size, and arrangement of chromosomes. This is typically done using a microscope. Chromosomal mapping refers to the process of determining the location of specific genes on a chromosome, which is not the same as examining the overall characteristics of chromosomes. Inheritance testing typically involves analyzing genetic markers or specific genes to determine the likelihood of inheriting certain traits or diseases. Genotyping refers to the process of analyzing an individual's genetic makeup. Karyotyping, on the other hand, specifically involves examining the shape, size, and arrangement of chromosomes. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Karyotyping.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
