    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A flexible major connector in a removable partial denture (RPD) is designed to provide flexibility and adaptability to the oral tissues. It allows for better distribution of forces and reduces stress on the abutment teeth. Therefore, it is unlikely to cause PDL destruction of abutment teeth (B) or difficulty in occlusion (D). However, there is a possibility that a flexible major connector may cause ill-fitting of the RPD (C) if it is not properly designed or adjusted. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A. It will make other components more effective.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
