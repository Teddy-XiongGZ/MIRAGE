    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Impression compound is a type of dental material used for making impressions of teeth and oral tissues. It is a thermoplastic material that softens when heated and hardens when cooled. To determine the characteristic property of impression compound, we need to consider its properties and behavior. A. Low thermal conductivity: Impression compound is not known for its low thermal conductivity. It is a material that can be heated and cooled to change its physical properties, so it is expected to have moderate thermal conductivity. B. High flow property: Impression compound is not known for its high flow property. It is a material that needs to be softened and manipulated by the dentist before making an impression. It is not a highly flowable material like some other dental impression materials. C. Degradation in presence of moisture: Impression compound is known to be stable in the presence of moisture. It does not degrade or lose its properties when exposed to moisture. This property makes it suitable for making impressions in the oral cavity, which is a moist environment. D. Remain distortion free up to 72 hrs. pouring can be safely delayed: This is the characteristic property of impression compound. It remains distortion-free for up to 72 hours, allowing the dentist to delay pouring the impression without compromising the accuracy of the final cast. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Remain distortion free up to 72 hrs. pouring can be safely delayed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
