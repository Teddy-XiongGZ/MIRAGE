    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by permanent dilation of the bronchi due to previous tuberculosis infection. Auscultation findings in bronchiectasis typically include abnormal breath sounds and adventitious lung sounds. Late inspiratory crackles are commonly heard in bronchiectasis due to the presence of secretions and mucus in the dilated bronchi. Bibasilar crepitations may also be present due to the accumulation of secretions in the dependent areas of the lungs. Tubular breath sounds are not typically observed in bronchiectasis. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Late inspiratory crackles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
