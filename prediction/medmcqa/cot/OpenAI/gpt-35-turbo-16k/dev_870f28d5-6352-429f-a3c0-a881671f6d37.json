    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Increased intracranial pressure can cause various symptoms due to the compression of brain tissue and disruption of normal brain function. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Headache: Headache is a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure. It occurs due to the stretching and irritation of pain-sensitive structures within the brain.\\n\\nB. Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting can occur as a result of increased intracranial pressure. The pressure can stimulate the vomiting center in the brainstem.\\n\\nC. Muscle twitching: Muscle twitching is not typically associated with increased intracranial pressure. It is more commonly seen in conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system or muscles themselves.\\n\\nD. Somnolence: Somnolence, or excessive sleepiness, can occur with increased intracranial pressure. It is a result of the brain's altered state and impaired function.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the option that is not true about increased intracranial pressure is C. Muscle twitching.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
