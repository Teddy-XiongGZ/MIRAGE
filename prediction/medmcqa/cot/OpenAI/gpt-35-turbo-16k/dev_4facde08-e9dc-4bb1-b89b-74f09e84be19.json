    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Marginal bone loss around mandibular implant can be influenced by various factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Abutment: The abutment is the component that connects the implant fixture to the prosthetic restoration. While the design and material of the abutment can affect the soft tissue response, it does not directly influence marginal bone loss.\\n\\nB. Boning technique: The bone grafting technique used during implant placement can impact the stability and integration of the implant, which in turn can affect marginal bone loss. Therefore, this option could be a potential factor.\\n\\nC. Connector: The connector refers to the component that connects the implant fixture to the abutment. Similar to the abutment, the design and material of the connector can influence soft tissue response but do not directly affect marginal bone loss.\\n\\nD. Implant fixture: The implant fixture is the main component that is surgically placed into the jawbone. It plays a crucial role in osseointegration and stability. Any factors that affect the integration and stability of the implant fixture can impact marginal bone loss. Therefore, this option could also be a potential factor.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the option that does not directly influence marginal bone loss around mandibular implant is the connector (option C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
