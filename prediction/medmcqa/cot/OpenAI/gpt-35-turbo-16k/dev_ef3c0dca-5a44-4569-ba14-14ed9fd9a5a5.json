    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucose is a monosaccharide and is absorbed in the small intestine. The method of transport of glucose in the intestine involves the movement of glucose molecules across the intestinal epithelial cells. Let's consider the options: \\n\\nA. Primary active transport: This involves the use of ATP to move molecules against their concentration gradient. Glucose is not actively transported using ATP in the intestine. \\n\\nB. Secondary active transport: This involves the use of an electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport to drive the movement of molecules. Glucose is indeed transported in the intestine using secondary active transport. \\n\\nC. Simple diffusion: This is the passive movement of molecules down their concentration gradient. Glucose is not transported by simple diffusion in the intestine. \\n\\nD. Counter transport: This involves the simultaneous movement of two different molecules in opposite directions. Glucose is not transported by counter transport in the intestine. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is B. Secondary active transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
