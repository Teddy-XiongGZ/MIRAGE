    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the population with the highest incidence of this type of root morphology, we need to analyze the radiograph. However, since the radiograph is not provided, we cannot directly assess the root morphology. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge and research findings. The incidence of root morphology can vary among different populations due to genetic and environmental factors. Based on existing research, the highest incidence of this type of root morphology is commonly found in population C, Mongoloids. Mongoloids, which include East Asians, have been reported to have a higher prevalence of certain dental traits, including root morphology, compared to other populations. Therefore, the answer choice is C. Mongoloids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
