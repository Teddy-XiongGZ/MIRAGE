    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ANB angle is a measurement used in orthodontics to assess the relationship between the maxilla (A point) and the mandible (B point) in relation to the cranial base (N point). In class II malocclusion, there is a discrepancy between the maxilla and the mandible, resulting in an overjet or protrusion of the upper teeth. This means that the maxilla is positioned more anteriorly than the mandible. Therefore, the ANB angle in class II malocclusion is typically greater than normal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Greater than normal\"}"
