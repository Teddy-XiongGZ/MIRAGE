    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The penetration of sealer into dentinal tubules can be influenced by various factors. One of the main factors is the type of sealer used. Different sealers have different viscosities and chemical compositions, which can affect their ability to penetrate the dentinal tubules. Another factor that can influence sealer penetration is the method of obturation. The technique used to place the sealer, such as lateral condensation or warm vertical compaction, can impact how well the sealer is able to penetrate the tubules. As for the options C and D, since they are both 'Not Recalled', they do not provide any relevant information to answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
