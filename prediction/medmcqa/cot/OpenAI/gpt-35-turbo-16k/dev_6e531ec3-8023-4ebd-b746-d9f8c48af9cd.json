    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the non radiographic method of working length, we need to consider the available options. \\n\\nOption A: Digital tactile sense refers to the ability to feel the resistance or change in texture when the instrument reaches the apex of the tooth. This method does not involve the use of radiographs. \\n\\nOption B: Apical periodontal sensitivity refers to the patient's response to pressure or stimulation at the apex of the tooth. This method also does not require radiographs. \\n\\nOption C: Electronic apex locator is a device that uses electrical resistance or impedance to determine the position of the apex of the tooth. This method is also non radiographic. \\n\\nConsidering the above explanations, it is clear that all of the options (A, B, and C) are non radiographic methods of working length determination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
