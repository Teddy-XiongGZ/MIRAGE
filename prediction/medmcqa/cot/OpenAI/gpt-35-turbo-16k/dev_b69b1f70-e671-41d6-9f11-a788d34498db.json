    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post translational modification refers to the chemical modification of a protein after it has been synthesized. This can include the addition or removal of functional groups, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, or glycosylation. To determine which amino acid does not include post translational modification, we need to consider the properties of each amino acid listed. A. Selenocysteine: Selenocysteine is an amino acid that contains selenium. It can undergo post translational modification, such as phosphorylation or glycosylation. B. Triiodothyronine: Triiodothyronine is a thyroid hormone and not an amino acid. It is not subject to post translational modification. C. Hydroxy-proline: Hydroxy-proline is an amino acid that contains a hydroxyl group. It can undergo post translational modification, such as hydroxylation or glycosylation. D. Hydroxy-lysine: Hydroxy-lysine is an amino acid that contains a hydroxyl group. It can undergo post translational modification, such as hydroxylation or glycosylation. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Triiodothyronine, as it is not an amino acid and therefore does not undergo post translational modification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
