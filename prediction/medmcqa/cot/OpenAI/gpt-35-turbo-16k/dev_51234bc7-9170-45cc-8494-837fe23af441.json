    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the fat content in the expressed breast milk of pre-term infants as compared to term infants, we need a study design that allows for comparison between the two groups. A. Case control study design is not suitable as it compares individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to individuals without the outcome (controls), and does not allow for direct comparison between pre-term and term infants. B. Prospective cohort study design follows a group of individuals over time and collects data on exposures and outcomes. While this design allows for comparison between pre-term and term infants, it may not be the best choice as it requires a long follow-up period and may be resource-intensive. C. Longitudinal study design involves collecting data from the same group of individuals over an extended period of time. This design allows for comparison between pre-term and term infants and is suitable for studying changes in fat content over time. D. Ambispective study design is not a recognized study design and is not suitable for this research question. Based on the above considerations, the best-suited study design for comparing the fat content in the expressed breast milk of pre-term infants to term infants is C. Longitudinal study.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
