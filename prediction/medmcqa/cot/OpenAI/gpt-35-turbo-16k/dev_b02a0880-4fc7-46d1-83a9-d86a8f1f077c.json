    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the first 2 months of pregnancy, the corpus luteum is responsible for producing estrogen and progesterone. The corpus luteum is formed in the ovary after ovulation occurs and it secretes hormones to support the early stages of pregnancy. The fetal ovaries and fetal adrenal glands are not yet developed enough to produce significant amounts of estrogen and progesterone. The placenta, although it eventually becomes the main source of estrogen and progesterone later in pregnancy, is not fully formed and functional during the first 2 months. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Corpus luteum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
