    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a 6-year-old patient with anemia and a high percentage of HbF (90%) on electrophoresis, we can suspect a diagnosis of beta-thalassemia. In beta-thalassemia, there is a decreased production of beta-globin chains, leading to an excess of alpha-globin chains. This excess of alpha-globin chains forms unstable tetramers, which precipitate within the red blood cells (RBCs) and cause damage. This damage leads to the destruction of RBCs, resulting in anemia. On peripheral smear, we would expect to see target cells (A) and nucleated red blood cells (B) due to the ineffective erythropoiesis and increased destruction of RBCs. Therefore, the correct answer is A, B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
