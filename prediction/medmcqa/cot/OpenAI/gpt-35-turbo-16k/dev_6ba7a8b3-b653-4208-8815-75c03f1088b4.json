    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Formalin is a commonly used fixative in biopsy to preserve tissue samples for histological examination. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. To prevent autolysis: Formalin helps to prevent autolysis, which is the self-digestion of tissues after death. This is a true statement.\\n\\nB. To make tissue rigid: Formalin cross-links proteins in the tissue, making it rigid and preserving its structure. This is a true statement.\\n\\nC. To kill microorganisms: Formalin has some antimicrobial properties and can kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms. This is a true statement.\\n\\nD. 2% formalin is used: This statement is not clear. It is common to use a 10% formalin solution for tissue fixation, but the concentration can vary depending on the specific protocol. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is D. 2% formalin is used, as it is the only option that is not true about formalin as a fixative in biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
