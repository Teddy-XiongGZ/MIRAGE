    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is typically treated in the outpatient setting. The choice of antibiotic depends on the severity of the infection, local resistance patterns, and patient-specific factors. In general, macrolides such as azithromycin are commonly used as first-line treatment for mild to moderate CAP in the outpatient setting. Vancomycin is not typically used as a first-line agent for CAP, as it is more commonly used for severe infections or when there is a high suspicion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that can be used for CAP, but it is usually reserved for more severe cases or when there is a concern for resistant pathogens. Streptomycin is not commonly used for CAP treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Azithromycin\"}"
