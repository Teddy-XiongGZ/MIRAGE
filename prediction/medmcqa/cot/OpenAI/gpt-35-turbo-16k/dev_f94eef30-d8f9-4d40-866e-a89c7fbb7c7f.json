    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which drug does not require dose adjustment in renal disease, we need to consider the pharmacokinetics of each drug. Aminoglycosides are primarily eliminated by the kidneys and require dose adjustment in renal disease. Vancomycin is also primarily eliminated by the kidneys and requires dose adjustment in renal disease. Calcium channel blockers are not primarily eliminated by the kidneys, so they do not require dose adjustment in renal disease. Metronidazole is primarily eliminated by the liver, so it also does not require dose adjustment in renal disease. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Calcium channel blocker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
