It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\\nStep 2: Prognostic factors are factors that can help predict the outcome or prognosis of a disease. In CDH, several factors have been identified as prognostic factors.\\nStep 3: Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication in CDH and is associated with poor prognosis. It is an important prognostic factor in CDH.\\nStep 4: Delay in emergent surgery can also have a significant impact on the prognosis of CDH. Early surgical repair is crucial in improving outcomes.\\nStep 5: The size of the defect is another important prognostic factor. Larger defects are associated with worse outcomes.\\nStep 6: Gestational age at diagnosis is also a prognostic factor in CDH. Infants diagnosed earlier in gestation tend to have better outcomes.\\nStep 7: Based on the above information, the least important prognostic factor in CDH among the given choices is B. Delay in emergent surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
