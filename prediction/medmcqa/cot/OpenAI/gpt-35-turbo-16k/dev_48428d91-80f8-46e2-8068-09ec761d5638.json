    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The C wave in the jugular venous pulse (JVP) represents the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during isovolumetric contraction of the ventricles. This occurs when the ventricles contract and the pressure within the ventricles rises, causing the tricuspid valve to bulge into the right atrium. The other options, such as atrial contraction, atrial filling, and rapid ventricular filling, do not directly cause the C wave in the JVP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
