    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's go through each option one by one to determine which one is true. \\n\\nOption A states that the sound frequency greater than 75 decibel (dB) causes damage to the ear. This statement is true, as exposure to high sound frequencies can indeed cause damage to the ear. \\n\\nOption B states that the frequency of rotation of the bur is 6000-8000rpm. This statement is also true, as the typical range of rotation for an aerotor hand piece is indeed 6000-8000rpm. \\n\\nOption C states that it will harm more in elderly than very young. This statement is false, as the harm caused by the use of an aerotor hand piece is not dependent on age. \\n\\nOption D states that its use in younger teeth is contraindicated. This statement is also false, as the use of an aerotor hand piece is not contraindicated in younger teeth. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the only statement that is false is option C. Therefore, the answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
