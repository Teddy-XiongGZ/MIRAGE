    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a commonly used antiviral medication for the treatment and prevention of influenza. To determine its mechanism of action, we need to consider its target and mode of action. A. Inhibition of M2 receptor: This option is incorrect because Oseltamivir does not target the M2 receptor. The M2 receptor is targeted by another antiviral medication called amantadine. B. Neuraminidase inhibition: This option is correct. Oseltamivir works by inhibiting the neuraminidase enzyme, which is essential for the release of newly formed viral particles from infected cells. By inhibiting neuraminidase, Oseltamivir prevents the spread of the virus to other cells and reduces the severity and duration of influenza symptoms. C. Inhibition of RNA dependent DNA polymerase: This option is incorrect. Oseltamivir does not target RNA dependent DNA polymerase. This enzyme is involved in the replication of DNA viruses, not influenza viruses. D. Apoptosis of infected cells: This option is incorrect. Oseltamivir does not induce apoptosis (cell death) of infected cells. Its primary mechanism of action is neuraminidase inhibition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Neuraminidase inhibition\"}"
