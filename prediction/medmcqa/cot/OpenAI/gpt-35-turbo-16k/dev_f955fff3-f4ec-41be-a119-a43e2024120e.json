    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parotid gland is innervated by both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The parasympathetic innervation is responsible for the secretomotor function of the gland, while the sympathetic innervation is responsible for vasomotor function. A. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers are responsible for the secretomotor function of the parotid gland, so this statement is true. B. The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers relay in the otic ganglion before reaching the parotid gland, so this statement is true. C. The preganglionic parasympathetic nerves that innervate the parotid gland begin in the inferior salivatory nucleus, not the inferior petrosal nucleus. Therefore, this statement is false. D. Sympathetic nerves are responsible for the vasomotor function of the parotid gland, so this statement is true. Based on the above analysis, the false statement about the innervation of the parotid gland is C. Preganglionic parasympathetic nerve begins in the inferior petrosal nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
