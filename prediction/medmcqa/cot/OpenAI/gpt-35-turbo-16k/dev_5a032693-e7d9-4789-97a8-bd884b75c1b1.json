    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the GPCR that does not act through opening of potassium channels, we need to consider the known actions of each receptor listed. Muscarinic M2 receptors are known to activate potassium channels, leading to hyperpolarization. Dopamine D2 receptors can also activate potassium channels. Serotonin 5 HT1 receptors, on the other hand, primarily act through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and modulation of calcium channels. Finally, the Angiotensin 1 receptor primarily activates phospholipase C and does not directly affect potassium channels. Therefore, the GPCR that does not act through opening of potassium channels is the Angiotensin 1 receptor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
