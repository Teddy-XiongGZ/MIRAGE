    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Clavulanic acid is a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. \u03b2-lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that can inactivate \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, such as ampicillin. By inhibiting \u03b2-lactamases, clavulanic acid allows ampicillin to remain active against \u03b2-lactamase-producing organisms. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Inhibition of \u03b2-lactamases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
