    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zinc oxide-eugenol cement is a type of dental cement commonly used for temporary restorations. To determine which component gives its strength, we need to understand the composition of the cement. Zinc oxide-eugenol cement is made up of two main components: zinc oxide and eugenol. Eugenol is derived from oil of cloves, which provides the cement with its antimicrobial properties. Zinc oxide, on the other hand, is responsible for the strength of the cement. It acts as a filler and provides the cement with its mechanical properties. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Zinc oxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
