    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Manning score, also known as the Biophysical score, is a method used to assess the well-being of a fetus during pregnancy. It evaluates five components: fetal heart rate, fetal breathing movements, fetal body movements, fetal tone, and amniotic fluid volume. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating a healthier fetus. To answer the question, we need to identify the component that is not included in the Manning score. A. Non stress test: This test measures the fetal heart rate in response to fetal movement. It is one of the components of the Manning score. B. Oxytocin challenge test: This test evaluates the fetal heart rate response to contractions induced by the hormone oxytocin. It is also one of the components of the Manning score. C. Fetal body movement: This refers to the movement of the fetus inside the womb. It is one of the components of the Manning score. D. Respiratory activity of child: This refers to the breathing movements of the fetus. It is one of the components of the Manning score. Based on the above information, all of the options (A, B, C, and D) are components of the Manning score. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
