    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A subcondylar fracture is a fracture of the condylar process of the mandible. It is usually caused by trauma to the jaw. To determine the clinical presentation of a subcondylar fracture, we need to consider the anatomical location of the fracture and its impact on the surrounding structures. Option A: Moderate intraoral bleeding is not typically associated with a subcondylar fracture. Intraoral bleeding may occur with other types of jaw fractures, but it is not a specific finding for a subcondylar fracture. Option B: Trismus and bilateral crepitus are more commonly associated with fractures of the body or angle of the mandible, rather than a subcondylar fracture. Trismus refers to difficulty in opening the mouth, and bilateral crepitus refers to a grating or crackling sound that can be felt or heard when the jaw is moved. These findings are not specific to a subcondylar fracture. Option C: Deviation of the mandible to the right on protrusion is a common finding in a subcondylar fracture. This occurs because the fractured condylar process is no longer able to guide the mandible in a straight path, resulting in a deviation to the opposite side. Option D: Inability to deviate the mandible to the right is not a typical finding in a subcondylar fracture. In fact, the ability to deviate the mandible to the opposite side is often preserved in subcondylar fractures. Based on the above reasoning, the correct answer is C. Deviation of the mandible to the right on protrusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
