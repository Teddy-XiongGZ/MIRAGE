    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After the appearance of rash, prophylactic isolation of measles case is necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. Measles is highly contagious and can be transmitted through respiratory droplets. The incubation period for measles is typically 10-14 days, meaning that a person can be infected with the virus but not show symptoms for up to two weeks. Once the rash appears, the person is considered contagious. The duration of isolation required depends on the contagious period of the disease. Measles is considered contagious for about 4 days before and after the appearance of the rash. Therefore, the minimum duration of prophylactic isolation for a measles case would be 4 days before the rash appears plus 4 days after the rash appears, totaling 8 days. However, since the options provided do not include 8 days, the closest option would be C. 7 days.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
