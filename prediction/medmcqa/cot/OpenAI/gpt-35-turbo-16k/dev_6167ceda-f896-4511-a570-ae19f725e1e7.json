    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is a hormone that is released by the pancreas in response to low blood sugar levels. It has several effects on the body, including the regulation of lipid metabolism. Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down lipids (fats) into smaller molecules. Lipoprotein lipase is primarily involved in the breakdown of triglycerides in circulating lipoproteins. Hormone-sensitive lipase is responsible for the breakdown of stored triglycerides in adipose tissue. Gastric lipase is an enzyme found in the stomach that helps with the digestion of dietary fats. Pancreatic lipase is an enzyme secreted by the pancreas that is responsible for the breakdown of triglycerides in the small intestine. Given that glucagon is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, the lipase that is most likely to be controlled by glucagon is hormone-sensitive lipase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
