    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The scaphoid bone is located in the wrist and has a unique blood supply. The blood supply to the scaphoid bone is retrograde, meaning it flows from distal to proximal. A scaphoid fracture at the waist is at the middle segment of the bone. Due to the retrograde blood supply, the segment most susceptible to avascular necrosis would be the distal segment, as it is the furthest from the blood supply. Therefore, the answer is B. Distal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
