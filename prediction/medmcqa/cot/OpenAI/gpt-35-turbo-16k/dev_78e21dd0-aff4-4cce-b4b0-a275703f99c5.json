    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood vessels. It is highest in the arteries when the heart contracts and pumps blood into the arteries. As the blood flows through the arteries, it gradually decreases in pressure. The capillaries are the smallest blood vessels where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products occurs. The blood pressure in the capillaries is lower than in the arteries. The venules are small blood vessels that collect blood from the capillaries and carry it back to the heart. The blood pressure in the venules is even lower than in the capillaries. Therefore, the minimum blood pressure is in the venules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
