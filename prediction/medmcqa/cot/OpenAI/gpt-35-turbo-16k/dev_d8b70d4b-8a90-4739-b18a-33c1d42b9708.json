    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the likely explanation for the finding, we need to consider the relationship between false positive results and the prevalence of disease, as well as the specificity of the test. False positive results occur when individuals without the disease test positive. If the proportion of false positive results among those who test positive is lower in population A compared to population B, it suggests that the test is more accurate in population A. The prevalence of disease refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have the disease. If the prevalence of disease is higher in population A, it would increase the likelihood of false positive results. Conversely, if the prevalence of disease is lower in population A, it would decrease the likelihood of false positive results. Therefore, the likely explanation for the finding is that the prevalence of disease is lower in population A, resulting in a lower proportion of false positive results among those who test positive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. The prevalence of disease is lower in population A\"}"
