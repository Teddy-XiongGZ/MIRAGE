    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vasodilation refers to the widening or relaxation of blood vessels, which leads to increased blood flow. Several factors can cause vasodilation. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Thromboxane A2: Thromboxane A2 is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it causes blood vessels to constrict or narrow. Therefore, it does not cause vasodilation.\\n\\nB. Prostaglandin E2: Prostaglandin E2 is a potent vasodilator. It relaxes smooth muscle in blood vessel walls, leading to vasodilation.\\n\\nC. Histamine: Histamine is released during allergic reactions and causes vasodilation by relaxing the smooth muscle in blood vessel walls.\\n\\nD. Serotonin: Serotonin is primarily involved in vasoconstriction and does not cause vasodilation. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is B. Prostaglandin E2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
