    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The likely explanation for the bradycardia in this case is the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex is a cardioinhibitory reflex that occurs in response to stimulation of mechanoreceptors in the ventricles. It is characterized by a decrease in heart rate, vasodilation, and hypotension. In this case, the subarachnoid block with bupivacaine (heavy) likely caused a decrease in sympathetic outflow, leading to vasodilation and activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. The level of block at T6 suggests that the sympathetic fibers supplying the heart were affected, leading to bradycardia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
