    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most accurate and safe method to diagnose a viable pregnancy at 6 weeks is by using ultrasound (USG) for fetal cardiac activity. This method allows visualization of the fetal heartbeat, which confirms the presence of a live pregnancy. Doppler assessment of fetal cardiac activity (choice A) is a technique that uses sound waves to detect and measure the fetal heartbeat. While it can be used to assess fetal well-being later in pregnancy, it may not be as accurate or reliable as USG in early pregnancy. Urinary Beta-hCG determination (choice C) is a test that measures the level of the pregnancy hormone hCG in the urine. While it can indicate the presence of a pregnancy, it does not provide information about the viability or cardiac activity of the fetus. Per vaginal examination of uterine size corresponding to 6 weeks gestation (choice D) is a physical examination that estimates the size of the uterus based on gestational age. However, it is not as accurate or reliable as USG for confirming the presence of a viable pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. USG for fetal cardiac activity\"}"
