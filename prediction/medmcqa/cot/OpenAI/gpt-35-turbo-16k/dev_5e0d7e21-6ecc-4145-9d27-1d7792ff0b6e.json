    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Partial veneer crowns are dental restorations that cover only a portion of the tooth. They are used to restore teeth with specific conditions. To determine which condition is contraindicated for a partial veneer crown, we need to consider the purpose and design of this type of crown. Partial veneer crowns are typically used to restore teeth with minimal damage or decay, where the majority of the tooth structure is still intact. They are not suitable for teeth with extensive damage or decay. Now let's consider each option: A. Long teeth: Long teeth do not necessarily indicate extensive damage or decay, so partial veneer crowns may still be suitable. B. Short teeth: Short teeth may indicate a lack of tooth structure, which could make it difficult to properly place and retain a partial veneer crown. Therefore, partial veneer crowns may not be recommended for short teeth. C. Tipped teeth: Tipped teeth refer to teeth that are inclined or tilted. While this may affect the alignment and occlusion of the teeth, it does not necessarily indicate extensive damage or decay. Therefore, partial veneer crowns may still be suitable for tipped teeth. D. Tapered teeth: Tapered teeth refer to teeth that have a gradual reduction in width towards the incisal or occlusal edge. This shape may make it challenging to properly place and retain a partial veneer crown. Therefore, partial veneer crowns may not be recommended for tapered teeth. Based on this analysis, the answer is B. Short teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
