    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the WHO definition, the criteria for considering a high endemic area for meningococcal meningitis is based on the number of cases per 100,000 population. Let's evaluate the options: \\n\\nA. <2 per 1,00,000 population: This option suggests that a high endemic area would have less than 2 cases per 100,000 population. \\nB. 2-10 per 1,00,000 population: This option suggests that a high endemic area would have between 2 and 10 cases per 100,000 population. \\nC. >10 per 1,00,000 population: This option suggests that a high endemic area would have more than 10 cases per 100,000 population. \\nD. >100 per 1,00,000 population: This option suggests that a high endemic area would have more than 100 cases per 100,000 population. \\n\\nBased on the WHO definition, the correct answer would be C. >10 per 1,00,000 population, as this indicates a high endemic area for meningococcal meningitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
