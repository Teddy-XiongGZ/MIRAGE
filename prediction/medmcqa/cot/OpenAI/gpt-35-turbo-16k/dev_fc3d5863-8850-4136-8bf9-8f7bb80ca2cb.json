    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's compare the half-life of rifabutin and rifampicin. If rifabutin has a longer half-life than rifampicin, then option A is not true. Next, let's consider the incidence of drug interactions. If rifabutin has a lesser incidence of drug interactions compared to rifampicin, then option B is not true. Moving on, let's evaluate the efficacy against MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex). If rifabutin is more efficacious against MAC compared to rifampicin, then option C is not true. Finally, let's assess the efficacy for pulmonary TB. If rifabutin is more efficacious for pulmonary TB compared to rifampicin, then option D is not true. Based on this analysis, we can determine the answer choice that is not true for rifabutin as compared to rifampicin.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
