    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The non functional cusp refers to the cusp that does not have a functional role in the chewing process. In dental anatomy, the non functional cusp is typically found on premolars. To determine which tooth has a non functional cusp, we need to identify the premolar with a non functional cusp. Step 1: Identify the premolars in the given options. - Lower 1st premolar - Upper 1st premolar - Lower 2nd premolar - Upper 1st premolar Step 2: Determine which premolar has a non functional cusp. - The lower 1st premolar and lower 2nd premolar have two cusps, one buccal and one lingual, which are both functional in the chewing process. - The upper 1st premolar has two cusps, one buccal and one lingual, which are both functional in the chewing process. Step 3: Based on the above analysis, the tooth with a non functional cusp is the Upper 1st premolar. Therefore, the answer is D. Upper 1st premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
