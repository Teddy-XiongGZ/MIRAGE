    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The proximal segment of mandibular angle fracture is usually displaced in a specific direction. To determine the direction of displacement, we need to understand the anatomy of the mandible. The mandible has two main segments - the proximal segment (also known as the ramus) and the distal segment (also known as the body). The angle of the mandible is the junction between these two segments. In a mandibular angle fracture, the proximal segment is usually displaced due to the force applied to the mandible. Now, let's analyze the options: A. Anterior and Superior: This option suggests that the proximal segment is displaced in an anterior and superior direction. However, this is not the usual direction of displacement in a mandibular angle fracture. B. Posterior and interior: This option suggests that the proximal segment is displaced in a posterior and interior direction. Again, this is not the usual direction of displacement in a mandibular angle fracture. C. Interior only: This option suggests that the proximal segment is displaced in an interior direction only. While the proximal segment can be displaced in an interior direction, it is not the only direction of displacement in a mandibular angle fracture. D. Posterior and superior: This option suggests that the proximal segment is displaced in a posterior and superior direction. This is the usual direction of displacement in a mandibular angle fracture. The force applied to the mandible causes the proximal segment to be displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Posterior and superior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
