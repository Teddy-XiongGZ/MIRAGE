    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges, which are the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord. It is primarily supplied by the middle meningeal artery, which is a branch of the maxillary artery. Therefore, we can eliminate option A. The meningeal branch of the internal carotid artery in the posterior cranial fossa also supplies the dura mater, so we can eliminate option B. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries are branches of the ophthalmic artery and supply the dura mater, so we can eliminate option C. This leaves us with option D, the accessory meningeal artery. The accessory meningeal artery is a branch of the maxillary artery, and it supplies the dura mater. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
