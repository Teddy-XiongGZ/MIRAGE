    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GDM (Gestational DM) is a condition where high blood sugar levels develop during pregnancy. It is important to identify factors that are not associated with GDM. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Past history of fetal abnormality: This is not directly associated with GDM. GDM is primarily related to maternal blood sugar levels during pregnancy.\\nB. Obesity: Obesity is a risk factor for developing GDM. Increased body weight and body mass index (BMI) are associated with an increased risk of GDM.\\nC. Hypertension: Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a risk factor for developing GDM. Women with pre-existing hypertension have an increased risk of developing GDM.\\nD. Macrosomia: Macrosomia, which refers to a baby with a birth weight above the 90th percentile, is associated with GDM. High blood sugar levels in the mother can lead to excessive fetal growth.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the answer is A. Past history of fetal abnormality is not associated with GDM.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
