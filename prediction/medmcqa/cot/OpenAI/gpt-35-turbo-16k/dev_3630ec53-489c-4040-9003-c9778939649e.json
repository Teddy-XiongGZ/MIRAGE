    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Golgi bodies are responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for transport to their final destinations. They receive proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then modify them by adding carbohydrates or other molecules. This modification process is known as glycosylation. After modification, Golgi bodies sort the proteins and lipids and package them into vesicles for transport to various parts of the cell or for secretion outside of the cell. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Sorting of glycoproteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
