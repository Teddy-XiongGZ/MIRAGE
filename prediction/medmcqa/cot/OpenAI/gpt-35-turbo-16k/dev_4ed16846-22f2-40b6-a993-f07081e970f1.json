    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxilla is the upper jawbone that forms the upper part of the face. It plays a crucial role in facial growth and development. To determine the cause of vertical growth of the maxilla, we need to consider the different structures involved. A. Growth of the alveolus: The alveolus refers to the bony socket in which the teeth are anchored. While the alveolus does contribute to the vertical growth of the maxilla to some extent, it is not the primary cause. B. Growth at sutures: Sutures are the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull. They allow for growth and expansion of the skull bones. Growth at sutures, particularly the midpalatal suture, is a significant contributor to the vertical growth of the maxilla. C. Growth of the cranial base: The cranial base refers to the bottom part of the skull on which the brain rests. Growth of the cranial base, specifically the anterior cranial base, influences the vertical growth of the maxilla. D. Growth of the synchondrosis: A synchondrosis is a type of joint where the connecting tissue is hyaline cartilage. While synchondroses are present in the skull, they are not directly involved in the vertical growth of the maxilla. Considering the above information, the correct answer is B. Growth at sutures, as it is the primary cause of vertical growth of the maxilla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
