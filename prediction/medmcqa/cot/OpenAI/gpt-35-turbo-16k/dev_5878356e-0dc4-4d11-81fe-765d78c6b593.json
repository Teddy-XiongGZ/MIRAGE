    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reciprocal arm taper refers to the gradual reduction in diameter or thickness of an object as it extends or tapers towards one end. In this case, we are looking for the number of dimensions in which the taper occurs. To determine the number of dimensions, we need to consider the shape of the object. If the taper occurs in only one direction, such as along a straight line, it would be considered a one-dimensional taper. If the taper occurs in two directions, such as along a curved surface, it would be considered a two-dimensional taper. If the taper occurs in three directions, such as along multiple curved surfaces, it would be considered a three-dimensional taper. If there is no taper at all, then it would be considered not tapered.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 2 dimension\"}"
