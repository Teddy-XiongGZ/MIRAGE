    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in major connector construction involves determining the design of the stress bearing areas. This is important because the major connector is responsible for transmitting forces from the prosthesis to the supporting structures in the mouth. Therefore, it is crucial to design the stress bearing areas in a way that can effectively distribute and manage these forces. Once the stress bearing areas are determined, the design of the non stress bearing areas can be considered. These areas do not directly bear the forces but still play a role in the overall stability and retention of the prosthesis. After the design of both stress bearing and non stress bearing areas is finalized, the next step would be marking the outline of the major connector on the cast or model. This helps in accurately fabricating the major connector. Finally, the selection of the strap type can be made, which refers to choosing the appropriate material and shape for the major connector.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
