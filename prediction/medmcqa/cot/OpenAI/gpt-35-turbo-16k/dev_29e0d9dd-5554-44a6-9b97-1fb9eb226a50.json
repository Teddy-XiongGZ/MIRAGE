    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. The survival of an ectopic pregnancy depends on the location within the fallopian tube. The fallopian tube is divided into four parts: isthmus, ampulla, infundibulum, and cornua. The isthmus is the narrowest part of the fallopian tube, located closest to the uterus. The ampulla is the wider middle part of the fallopian tube. The infundibulum is the funnel-shaped distal end of the fallopian tube, and the cornua are the proximal parts of the fallopian tube that connect to the uterus. The longest survival of an ectopic pregnancy is typically seen in the ampulla. The ampulla provides a more favorable environment for the developing embryo due to its wider diameter and increased blood supply compared to the other parts of the fallopian tube. This allows for better implantation and potential for longer survival of the ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, the answer is B. Ampulla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
