    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The growth of the maxilla refers to the development and enlargement of the upper jaw bone. To determine how the normal growth of the maxilla occurs, we need to consider the different processes involved. A. Displacement and drift: This refers to the movement and shifting of the maxilla. While some displacement and drift may occur during growth, it is not the primary mechanism of normal growth. B. Drift only: This option suggests that only drift, which is the passive movement of teeth due to changes in the surrounding bone, is responsible for the growth of the maxilla. However, this is not accurate as drift alone cannot account for the overall growth of the maxilla. C. Apposition: Apposition refers to the process of adding new bone tissue to the existing bone. This is a key mechanism in the normal growth of the maxilla. The maxilla grows by the deposition of new bone on its surfaces, allowing for expansion and development. D. Replacement resorption: Replacement resorption is a process where old bone is resorbed and replaced by new bone. While this process occurs in bone remodeling, it is not the primary mechanism for the growth of the maxilla. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Apposition, as it is the primary process involved in the normal growth of the maxilla.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
