    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The termination point of a root canal procedure refers to the point at which the cleaning and shaping of the root canal system ends. The apical constriction is a narrow portion of the root canal near the apex of the tooth. The apical foramen is the opening at the apex of the tooth through which the nerves and blood vessels enter the root canal. Both the apical constriction and the apical foramen are important landmarks in root canal treatment. The apical constriction is the ideal termination point for a root canal procedure as it represents the natural endpoint of the root canal system. However, in some cases, the root canal may be extended slightly beyond the apical constriction to ensure complete cleaning and shaping. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
