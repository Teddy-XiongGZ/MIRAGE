    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sterilization of hand piece involves subjecting it to high temperatures and/or chemicals to kill microorganisms. The process of sterilization can have certain effects on the hand piece. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Rust of hand piece: Sterilization does not directly cause rust. Rust is typically caused by exposure to moisture and oxygen. Sterilization processes usually involve drying the hand piece thoroughly to prevent rust.\\n\\nB. Turbine wear: Sterilization does not directly cause turbine wear. Turbine wear is usually a result of mechanical stress and friction during use.\\n\\nC. Fibre loss: Sterilization does not directly cause fibre loss. Fibre loss is typically associated with the wear and tear of fiber optic components in the hand piece.\\n\\nD. Loss of torque: Sterilization can potentially cause loss of torque in the hand piece. High temperatures or chemicals used in sterilization can affect the lubrication and mechanical components of the hand piece, leading to a decrease in torque.\\n\\nConsidering the above explanations, the most likely effect of sterilization on the hand piece is loss of torque.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
