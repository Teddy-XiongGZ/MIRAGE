    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The principal fibers of the periodontal ligament (PDL) are responsible for attaching the tooth to the surrounding bone. To determine the type of fibers, we need to consider the composition of the PDL. The PDL is primarily composed of collagen fibers, which provide strength and support. Elastic fibers are also present in the PDL, allowing for some flexibility and resilience. Reticular fibers, on the other hand, are typically found in organs and provide a framework for other cells. Based on this information, the answer is D. Collagenous and elastic fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
