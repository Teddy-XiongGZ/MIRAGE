    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In hemorrhagic shock, hypotension occurs when there is a significant loss of blood volume. The body compensates for blood loss by constricting blood vessels and increasing heart rate. However, when blood loss exceeds a certain threshold, the compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, leading to hypotension. The specific threshold at which hypotension occurs can vary depending on individual factors and the rate of blood loss. Generally, hypotension is more likely to occur when blood loss is greater than a certain percentage of the total blood volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 30% - 40%\"}"
