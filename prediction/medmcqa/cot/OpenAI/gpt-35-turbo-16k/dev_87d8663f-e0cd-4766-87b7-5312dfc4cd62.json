    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the coefficient of thermal expansion of ceramic is much lower than that of metal, it means that the ceramic will expand or contract less than the metal when exposed to temperature changes. This can lead to a mismatch in the expansion and contraction rates between the ceramic and the metal. If the ceramic expands or contracts less than the metal, it can create stress within the metal ceramic bond. This stress can potentially cause failure at the interface between the metal and the ceramic. Therefore, the most likely type of failure that may occur in this scenario is adhesive failure of metal ceramic bond.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
