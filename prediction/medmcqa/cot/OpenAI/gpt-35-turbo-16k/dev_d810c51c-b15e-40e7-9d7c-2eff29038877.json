    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ligamentum flavum is a ligament located in the spine. To determine its composition, we need to consider the types of collagen and other components found in ligaments. Type-II collagen is the main collagen type found in hyaline cartilage, not ligaments. Type-III collagen is commonly found in reticular fibers, which are present in organs like the liver and lymph nodes, but not typically in ligaments. Reticulin is a type of collagen that forms a delicate network of fibers, but it is not a major component of ligaments. Elastin is a protein that provides elasticity to tissues, including ligaments. Based on this information, the most likely component of ligamentum flavum is elastin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
