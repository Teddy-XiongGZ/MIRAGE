    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The internal surface of the mandible is the inner side of the lower jaw bone. To determine which structure is not present on this surface, we need to understand the anatomy of the mandible. The genial tubercle is a small bony prominence located in the midline of the mandible, near the symphysis menti. The mylohyoid ridge is a bony ridge that runs horizontally along the inner surface of the mandible, above the mylohyoid muscle. The lingula is a small bony projection located on the medial aspect of the mandibular ramus. The mental foramen is an opening located on the anterior aspect of the mandible, near the premolar teeth. Based on this information, the structure that is not present on the internal surface of the mandible is the mental foramen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
