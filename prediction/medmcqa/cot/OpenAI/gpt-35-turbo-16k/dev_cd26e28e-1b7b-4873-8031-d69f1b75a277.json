    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mother is a known case of chronic hepatitis B infection, which means she is positive for HBsAG. However, she is negative for HBeAG, indicating that she has a low viral load and is less likely to transmit the infection to her baby. The most appropriate treatment for the baby in this case would be both active and passive immunization soon after birth. Passive immunization with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) provides immediate protection against the virus, while active immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine stimulates the baby's immune system to produce long-term immunity. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Both active and passive immunization soon after birth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
