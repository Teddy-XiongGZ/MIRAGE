    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The facial nerve, also known as cranial nerve VII, is responsible for innervating the muscles of facial expression. To determine which of the given options is not innervated by the facial nerve, we need to identify the muscles that are innervated by this nerve. The platysma muscle is innervated by the facial nerve, so option A is not the correct answer. The anterior belly of the digastric muscle is innervated by the mylohyoid nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). Therefore, option B is not the correct answer. The stapedius muscle is innervated by the facial nerve, so option C is not the correct answer. The auricular muscles, which include the posterior, superior, and anterior auricular muscles, are innervated by the facial nerve. Therefore, the correct answer is D. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
