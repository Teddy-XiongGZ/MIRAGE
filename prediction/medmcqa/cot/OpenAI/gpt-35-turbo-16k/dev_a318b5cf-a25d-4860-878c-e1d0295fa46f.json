    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child in this case presents with chronic liver failure and muscle weakness at 3 months of age. The low serum glucose, along with ketoacidosis and decreased pH, suggests a metabolic disorder affecting glucose metabolism. The raised ALT and AST levels indicate liver dysfunction. The normal blood lactate and uric acid levels suggest that the defect is not in the glycolysis pathway. Intravenous glucagon raises blood glucose levels after meals but not after an overnight fast, indicating a defect in gluconeogenesis. The increased glycogen in the liver biopsy suggests a defect in glycogen metabolism. Based on these findings, the likely enzyme to be defective in this child is glucose-6-phosphatase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
