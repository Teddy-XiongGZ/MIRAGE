    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myelinated nerve fibers have several properties. Let's go through each option to determine which one is not a property of myelinated fibers. \\n\\nA. Conduction is slower in myelinated than in non-myelinated fibers: This is incorrect. Myelinated fibers actually conduct nerve impulses faster than non-myelinated fibers due to the presence of the myelin sheath, which acts as an insulator and allows for saltatory conduction.\\n\\nB. Current discharges at nodes of Ranvier: This is correct. In myelinated fibers, the current jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next, which is known as saltatory conduction. This allows for faster conduction of nerve impulses.\\n\\nC. Outer layer is of lipids: This is correct. The myelin sheath, which is the outer layer of myelinated fibers, is composed of lipids.\\n\\nD. Depolarization occurs only at nodes of Ranvier: This is incorrect. Depolarization occurs along the entire length of the myelinated fiber, but action potentials are regenerated only at the nodes of Ranvier.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Current discharges at nodes of Ranvier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
