    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In heavy calculus formers, early plaque consists of Ca, PO4, and K in what proportions. To determine the proportions, we need to consider the relative abundance of each element in the early plaque. Calcium (Ca) is a major component of dental plaque, and it is commonly found in higher concentrations compared to other elements. Phosphorous (PO4) is also present in significant amounts in dental plaque. Potassium (K) is less abundant in dental plaque compared to calcium and phosphorous. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Calcium > phosphorous > potassium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
