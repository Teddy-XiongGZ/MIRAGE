    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"AIDS is a condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which weakens the immune system. As a result, individuals with AIDS are more susceptible to various infections and diseases. When it comes to secondary infections in AIDS, it is important to consider the opportunistic infections that commonly occur in these individuals. Rubella is not typically considered an opportunistic infection in AIDS. HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) and Candida (a type of yeast) are both known to cause opportunistic infections in individuals with AIDS. Kaposi's sarcoma, on the other hand, is not an infection but rather a type of cancer that is more common in individuals with AIDS. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Kaposi's sarcoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
