    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Malaria relapse refers to the reoccurrence of symptoms after an initial infection has been treated. It is important to note that not all species of Plasmodium can cause relapse. Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale are known to have dormant liver stages called hypnozoites, which can reactivate and cause relapse months or even years after the initial infection. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium malariae, on the other hand, do not have hypnozoites and therefore do not cause relapse. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Plasmodium vivax and ovale.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
