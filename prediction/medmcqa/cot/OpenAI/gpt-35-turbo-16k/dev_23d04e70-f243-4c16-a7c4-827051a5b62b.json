    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"IDL (Intermediate Density Lipoprotein) is formed from the breakdown of VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein) in the bloodstream. Now, let's consider the fate of IDL in plasma. 1. IDL can be taken up by the liver: IDL particles have receptors on their surface that allow them to bind to liver cells. The liver can take up approximately 50% of the IDL particles from the plasma through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This process involves the internalization of the IDL particle into the liver cell, where it can be further metabolized. 2. IDL can be converted to LDL particle: If the IDL particle is not taken up by the liver, it can undergo further metabolism in the plasma. The enzyme hepatic lipase acts on IDL, converting it into LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) particles. This conversion occurs due to the removal of triglycerides from the IDL particle. Based on these steps, the correct answer is C. Both 1 and 2, as approximately 50% of the IDL particles are taken up by the liver, and the remaining IDL particles are converted to LDL particles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
