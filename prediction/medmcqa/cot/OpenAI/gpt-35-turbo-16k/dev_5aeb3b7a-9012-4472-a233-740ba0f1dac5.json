    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adenosine is a molecule that has anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the drug that acts by increasing extracellular adenosine would be beneficial in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Leflunomide: Leflunomide is an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits the production of pyrimidine, which is necessary for DNA synthesis. It does not directly increase extracellular adenosine.\\n\\nB. Hydroxychloroquine: Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that also has immunomodulatory effects. It does not directly increase extracellular adenosine.\\n\\nC. Azathioprine: Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits DNA synthesis. It does not directly increase extracellular adenosine.\\n\\nD. Methotrexate: Methotrexate is a commonly used disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drug. It acts by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Methotrexate has been shown to increase extracellular adenosine levels, making it the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
