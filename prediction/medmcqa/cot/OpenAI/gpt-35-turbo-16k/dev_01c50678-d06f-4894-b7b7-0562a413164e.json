    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Composite materials are made up of a matrix and filler particles. The matrix is typically a soft material, while the filler particles are hard. Polishing involves removing excess material from the surface of the composite to create a smooth and polished finish. The hardness of the matrix and filler particles can affect the ease of polishing. If the matrix and filler particles are both hard, it can be difficult to remove material evenly and achieve a smooth surface. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Hardness of matrix and filler particles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
