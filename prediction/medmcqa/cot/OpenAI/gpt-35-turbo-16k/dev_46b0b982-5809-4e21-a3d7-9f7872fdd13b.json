    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lateral shift, also known as Bennett's movement, refers to the movement of the mandible to one side during lateral jaw movements. This movement occurs due to the inclination of the condylar path. The condylar path is the curved path that the mandibular condyle follows during jaw movements. During lateral shift, the working condyle moves forward and downward on the working side, while the non-working condyle moves upward and backward on the non-working side. This movement results in a shift of the mandible to one side. Now, let's analyze the potential choices: A. Faciolingual position of teeth: The faciolingual position refers to the position of the teeth in the buccolingual direction. Lateral shift does not directly influence the faciolingual position of the teeth. B. Mesiodistal position of the teeth: The mesiodistal position refers to the position of the teeth in the mesiodistal direction. Lateral shift does not directly influence the mesiodistal position of the teeth. C. Both of the above: Since lateral shift does not directly influence the faciolingual or mesiodistal position of the teeth, this option is incorrect. D. None of the above: This option is correct as lateral shift does not directly influence the faciolingual or mesiodistal position of the teeth. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
