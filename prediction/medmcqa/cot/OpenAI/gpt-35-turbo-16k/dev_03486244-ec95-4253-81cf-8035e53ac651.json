    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A meningomyelocele is a type of neural tube defect where the spinal cord and the surrounding structures do not develop properly. It is characterized by a protrusion of the spinal cord and meninges through a defect in the vertebral column. In this case, the infant has a leaky meningomyelocele, which means that there is a communication between the spinal canal and the external environment. This communication can lead to an increased risk of infection. Therefore, the most useful test for diagnosis and management of the condition would be a culture and sensitivity test of the fluid or discharge coming from the leaky meningomyelocele. This would help identify the specific microorganisms causing the infection and guide appropriate antibiotic treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
