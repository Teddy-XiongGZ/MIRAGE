    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Desmosomes are specialized cell junctions that provide strong adhesion between cells. They are commonly found in tissues that experience mechanical stress, such as the skin and the heart. To determine the location with the highest concentration of desmosomes, we need to consider the tissues that are subjected to the most mechanical stress. Based on this information, the answer is likely to be either the skin (A) or the heart (D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
