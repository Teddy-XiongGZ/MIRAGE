    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lithium is a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. It is important to consider the potential interactions between lithium and anesthesia. Lithium has a long half-life, meaning it takes a significant amount of time for the drug to be eliminated from the body. Stopping lithium abruptly before anesthesia can lead to a rapid decrease in lithium levels, which can increase the risk of relapse or withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, it is generally recommended to stop lithium at least a few days before anesthesia to allow for a gradual decrease in lithium levels. The exact duration of discontinuation may vary depending on the individual patient and the specific anesthesia plan. However, in general, it is recommended to stop lithium at least 2-3 days before anesthesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 3 days\"}"
