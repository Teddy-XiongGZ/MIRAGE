    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which muscle is not attached laterally to the thyroid cartilage, we need to understand the attachments of each muscle. The thyroid cartilage has two prominent lines - the superior and inferior thyroid lines. The oblique line of the thyroid cartilage is located between these two lines. The muscles attached to the oblique line include the thyrohyoid and inferior constrictor muscles. The muscles attached laterally to the thyroid cartilage include the sternothyroid and superior constrictor muscles. Therefore, the muscle that is not attached laterally to the thyroid cartilage is the thyrohyoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
