    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The stage of oral cancer is determined by the size of the tumor (T), the involvement of nearby lymph nodes (N), and the presence of distant metastasis (M). In this case, the patient has stage T3N2M0, which means the tumor is larger than 4 cm but has not spread to distant sites. The presence of lymph node involvement indicates a higher risk of spread. Based on the stage of the cancer, the treatment options typically include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is often the primary treatment for oral cancer, especially for early-stage tumors. However, in this case, the tumor is larger and has spread to nearby lymph nodes, indicating a higher risk of recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, surgery alone may not be sufficient. Given the higher risk, the most appropriate treatment option would be a combination of surgery and additional treatment modalities. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used as adjuvant therapies to surgery in order to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of recurrence. Chemotherapy alone is generally not the preferred treatment for localized oral cancer, as it is more commonly used for advanced or metastatic disease. Therefore, option C can be ruled out. Considering the stage of the cancer and the higher risk of recurrence, the most appropriate treatment option for this patient would be surgery combined with radiotherapy (option B) or surgery combined with chemotherapy (option D). Both options have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with locally advanced oral cancer. However, the choice between radiotherapy and chemotherapy would depend on various factors, including the patient's overall health, tumor characteristics, and the expertise of the treating team. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice would be either B. Surgery + radiotherapy or D. Surgery + chemotherapy, depending on the specific circumstances and recommendations of the treating team.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/D\"}"
