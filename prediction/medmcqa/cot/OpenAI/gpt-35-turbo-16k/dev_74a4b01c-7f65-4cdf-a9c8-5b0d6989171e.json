    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During radiotherapy, the skin is exposed to high-energy radiation. This radiation can cause damage to the skin cells. After 2 weeks of radiotherapy, the skin is likely to show some signs of radiation damage. Erythema, which is redness of the skin, is a common early side effect of radiation therapy. Depigmentation, or loss of skin color, can also occur due to radiation damage. Radiation induced carcinomas, which are cancerous growths caused by radiation exposure, typically take longer to develop and are less likely to be seen after only 2 weeks of radiotherapy. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. Erythema.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
