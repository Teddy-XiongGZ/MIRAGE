    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Inflammation of the periapical tissue is typically caused by an infection in the tooth's root canal. This infection can occur due to various reasons such as dental caries or trauma. The infection leads to the accumulation of bacteria and their byproducts in the periapical area, which triggers an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response involves the release of chemical mediators and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. These immune cells, such as neutrophils, are responsible for combating the infection and clearing the bacteria. Therefore, the sustained inflammation of the periapical tissue is primarily sustained by the presence of microorganisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
