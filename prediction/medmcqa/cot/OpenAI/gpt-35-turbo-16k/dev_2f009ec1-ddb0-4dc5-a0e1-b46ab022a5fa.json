    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The chewing stroke refers to the movement of the mandible during the process of chewing. To determine where the chewing stroke starts from, we need to consider the occlusion of the teeth. Occlusion refers to the way the upper and lower teeth come together when the jaw is closed. There are two main positions of occlusion: centric occlusion (CO) and centric relation (CR). CO is the position where the teeth make maximum contact during biting and chewing, while CR is the position where the condyles of the mandible are in their most retruded and stable position. Maximum intercuspation refers to the position where the teeth are in maximum contact during biting and chewing. Based on this information, the chewing stroke typically starts from maximum intercuspation (C), as this is the position where the teeth are in maximum contact and provide the most stable and efficient biting and chewing motion. Therefore, the correct answer is C. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
