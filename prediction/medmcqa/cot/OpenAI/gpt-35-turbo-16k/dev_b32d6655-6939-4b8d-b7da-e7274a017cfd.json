    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a specialized extracellular matrix structure that plays a crucial role in the filtration process in the kidneys. Let's evaluate each statement to determine which one is not true. \\n\\nA. Type III collagen is present: This statement is true. The GBM is composed of type IV collagen, not type III collagen. \\n\\nB. Glomerular basement membrane is stained with PAS: This statement is true. The GBM can be stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which highlights the presence of glycoproteins and proteoglycans. \\n\\nC. Glomerular basement membrane acts as a filtration barrier: This statement is true. The GBM acts as a selective barrier, allowing the passage of small molecules while preventing the filtration of larger molecules such as proteins. \\n\\nD. Glomerular basement membrane is involved in charge-dependent filtration: This statement is true. The GBM has a negative charge due to the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which repel negatively charged molecules. \\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the statement that is not true about the glomerular basement membrane is A. Type III collagen is present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
