    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the 8th AJCC guidelines, the staging of oral cavity cancer is based on the size of the primary tumor (T), the presence of regional lymph node involvement (N), and the presence of distant metastasis (M). In this case, the lesion on the lateral border of the tongue is 2.5*3.5 cm with induration. According to the T staging, T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 4 cm. Since the lesion is 2.5*3.5 cm, it falls within the T2 category. There is no associated lymphadenopathy, so the N staging is N0, indicating no regional lymph node involvement. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so the M staging is M0, indicating no distant metastasis. Therefore, the staging according to the 8th AJCC guidelines would be T2N0M0.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. T2N0M0\"}"
