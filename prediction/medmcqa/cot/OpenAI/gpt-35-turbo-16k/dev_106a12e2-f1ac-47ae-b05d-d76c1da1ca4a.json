    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hyaline membrane disease of lungs, also known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), is a condition that primarily affects premature infants. It is characterized by the presence of hyaline membranes in the alveoli, which are composed of proteinaceous material. These membranes make it difficult for the lungs to expand and exchange oxygen properly. To determine the relationship between FRC (functional residual capacity) and closing volume in hyaline membrane disease, we need to understand the concept of these two terms. FRC is the volume of air that remains in the lungs after a normal exhalation, while closing volume is the lung volume at which small airways begin to close during expiration. In hyaline membrane disease, the lungs are stiff and have reduced compliance, making it difficult for them to expand fully. This leads to a decrease in FRC. Additionally, the presence of hyaline membranes in the alveoli can cause collapse of the small airways, resulting in an increase in closing volume. Based on this understanding, the correct answer is A. FRC is smaller than closing volume, as hyaline membrane disease is characterized by a decrease in FRC and an increase in closing volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
