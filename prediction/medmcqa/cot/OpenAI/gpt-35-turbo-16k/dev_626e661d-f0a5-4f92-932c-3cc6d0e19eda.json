    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentine permeability refers to the ability of substances to pass through the dentine. The factors governing dentine permeability include the smear layer, fluid convection, and the length of dentinal tubules. The smear layer is a layer of debris and microorganisms that covers the dentinal surface and can affect permeability. Fluid convection refers to the movement of fluid within the dentinal tubules, which can also affect permeability. The length of dentinal tubules is important because longer tubules provide a greater pathway for substances to pass through. The diffusion coefficient is a measure of how easily a substance can diffuse through a material. Therefore, it is not a factor governing dentine permeability. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
