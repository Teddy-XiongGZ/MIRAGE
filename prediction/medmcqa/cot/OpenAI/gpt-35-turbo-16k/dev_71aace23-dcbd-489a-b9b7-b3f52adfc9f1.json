    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Carey Coombs murmur is a type of murmur that is associated with rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory condition that can affect the heart valves. The murmur is typically heard during diastole, which is the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle. This means that option A, 'Delayed diastole murmur', is true. Rheumatic fever can cause damage to the heart valves, leading to regurgitation of blood. Therefore, option C, 'Can be associated with AR (aortic regurgitation)', is also true. However, Carey Coombs murmur is typically described as a high-pitched, blowing murmur. This means that option D, 'Low pitched murmur', is false. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
