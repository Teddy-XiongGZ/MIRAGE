    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ANA (antinuclear antibody) is a blood test used to detect the presence of autoantibodies that target the nucleus of cells. A positive ANA result indicates the presence of autoantibodies and is often associated with autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the condition that cannot be diagnosed without a positive ANA is the one that is not typically associated with positive ANA. A. Drug-induced lupus can be diagnosed without positive ANA because it is a known side effect of certain medications and can be diagnosed based on the patient's symptoms and medication history. B. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is commonly associated with positive ANA, but it is possible for a small percentage of patients with SLE to have negative ANA. Therefore, SLE can still be diagnosed without positive ANA. C. Sjogren syndrome is often associated with positive ANA, particularly with anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) antibodies. However, it is possible for some patients with Sjogren syndrome to have negative ANA. Therefore, Sjogren syndrome can still be diagnosed without positive ANA. D. Scleroderma is commonly associated with positive ANA, particularly with anti-centromere and anti-Scl-70 antibodies. A positive ANA is often used as a screening test for scleroderma. Therefore, scleroderma is the condition that cannot be diagnosed without positive ANA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
