    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Permanent teeth are the second set of teeth that replace the primary (baby) teeth. They are typically larger and stronger than the primary teeth. To determine which of the options least resembles a permanent tooth, we need to consider the characteristics of permanent teeth. Incisors are the front teeth that are sharp and used for cutting. Canines are the pointed teeth that are used for tearing. Molars are the back teeth that are used for grinding and chewing. The first and second molars are larger and have more cusps compared to the incisors and canines. Therefore, the option that least resembles a permanent tooth would be the one that is different in shape and function. Based on this reasoning, the answer choice is D. Mandibular 2nd Molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
