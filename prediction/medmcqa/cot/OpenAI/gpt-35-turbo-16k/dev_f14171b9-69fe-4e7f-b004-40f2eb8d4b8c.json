    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"G2 phase is the second gap phase in the cell cycle, following the G1 phase. During the G2 phase, the cell prepares for mitosis by synthesizing proteins and duplicating its organelles. G2 phase blockers are drugs that inhibit the progression of the cell cycle at the G2 phase. To determine which of the given options is not a G2 phase blocker, we need to identify which drugs do not target the G2 phase. Etoposide and Topotecan are both topoisomerase II inhibitors that act during the G2 phase. Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that also affects the G2 phase. However, Paclitaxel is a microtubule stabilizer that primarily acts during the M phase, not the G2 phase. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Paclitaxel.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
