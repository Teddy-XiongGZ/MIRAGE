    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the anion gap, we need to subtract the sum of the measured cations (Na+ and K+) from the sum of the measured anions (chloride and bicarbonate). The formula for calculating the anion gap is: Anion Gap = (Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + HCO3-). Given the lab values, the anion gap can be calculated as follows: Anion Gap = (137 + 4) - (110 + 15) = 16.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
