    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogenesis is the process of synthesizing glycogen from glucose, while glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down glycogen into glucose. In both processes, the enzyme responsible for the transfer of glucose residues from UDP-glucose to the growing glycogen chain is glycogen synthase. On the other hand, glycogen phosphorylase is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of glycogen by removing glucose residues. Glucan transferase is not involved in either glycogenesis or glycogenolysis. Phosphoglucomutase is an enzyme involved in the interconversion of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate, but it is not directly involved in glycogenesis or glycogenolysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Glycogen synthase\"}"
