    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking why the standardize technique is not used frequently. To determine the answer, let's evaluate each option. Option A states that the technique is inaccurate. Option B suggests that the technique relies on the inherent shape of the file to give the shape of the canal. Option C states that accessory canals are not removed efficiently. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider all the options. If any of the options are true, then the technique would not be used frequently. After evaluating all the options, it is clear that all of the above options are valid reasons why the standardize technique is not used frequently. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
