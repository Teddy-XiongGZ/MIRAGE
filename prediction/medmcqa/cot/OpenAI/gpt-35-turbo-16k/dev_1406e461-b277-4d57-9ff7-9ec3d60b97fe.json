    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Adrenaline is a medication that is commonly used during surgery to control bleeding. It works by constricting blood vessels and increasing blood pressure. However, it can also have some side effects. Let's consider each option:\\n\\nA. Syncope: Syncope refers to fainting or loss of consciousness. While adrenaline can cause an increase in heart rate, it is unlikely to directly cause syncope.\\n\\nB. Cardiac arrhythmias: Adrenaline can stimulate the heart and increase heart rate, which can potentially lead to cardiac arrhythmias.\\n\\nC. Drastic fall in blood pressure: Adrenaline is actually used to increase blood pressure, so a drastic fall in blood pressure is unlikely to be a side effect.\\n\\nD. Precipitation of allergic reaction: Adrenaline can cause allergic reactions in some individuals, but it is not a common side effect.\\n\\nBased on this information, the most likely side effect of adrenaline used for controlling bleeding during surgery is cardiac arrhythmias. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
