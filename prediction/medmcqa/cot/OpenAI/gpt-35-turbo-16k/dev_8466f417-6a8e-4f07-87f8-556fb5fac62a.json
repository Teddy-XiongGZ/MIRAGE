    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post op pulmonary complications can occur due to various factors such as obesity, surgery location, smoking history, and age. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. BMI>30: Obesity is a risk factor for post op pulmonary complications as it can lead to decreased lung volumes and impaired respiratory function. Therefore, this option is likely to be associated with post op pulmonary complications.\\n\\nB. Upper abdominal surgery: Upper abdominal surgery can cause post op pulmonary complications due to factors such as diaphragmatic dysfunction, impaired cough reflex, and decreased lung expansion. Therefore, this option is likely to be associated with post op pulmonary complications.\\n\\nC. Patient with 7 pack years of smoking: Smoking is a major risk factor for post op pulmonary complications as it can lead to impaired lung function, increased risk of infection, and delayed wound healing. Therefore, this option is likely to be associated with post op pulmonary complications.\\n\\nD. Age >70: Advanced age is a risk factor for post op pulmonary complications due to factors such as decreased lung elasticity, decreased respiratory muscle strength, and increased comorbidities. Therefore, this option is likely to be associated with post op pulmonary complications.\\n\\nBased on the above evaluation, the option that is least likely to be associated with post op pulmonary complications is option C. Patient with 7 pack years of smoking.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
