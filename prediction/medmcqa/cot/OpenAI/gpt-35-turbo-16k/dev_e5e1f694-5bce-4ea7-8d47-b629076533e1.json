    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When evaluating intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) using ultrasound, there are several parameters that can be assessed. The placental membrane is not a direct parameter for evaluating IUGR. The length of the femur can provide information about skeletal growth but may not be the best parameter for overall evaluation of IUGR. The abdominal circumference is a commonly used parameter for assessing fetal growth and can provide information about overall size and weight. The biparietal diameter (BPD) is another commonly used parameter that measures the diameter between the two parietal bones of the fetal skull and can provide information about fetal head growth. Considering these options, the best parameter for ultrasound evaluation of IUGR is likely the abdominal circumference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
