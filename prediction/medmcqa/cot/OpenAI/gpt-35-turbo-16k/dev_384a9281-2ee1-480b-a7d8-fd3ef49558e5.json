    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lateral spread of dental caries refers to the spread of decay from one tooth surface to another. To determine what facilitates this spread, we need to consider the structures involved. Enamel spindles are small tubules that extend from the dentinoenamel junction into the enamel, but they do not directly contribute to the lateral spread of caries. The dentinoenamel junction is the junction between the enamel and dentin, and while it can be a site of caries initiation, it does not facilitate the lateral spread. Enamel lamellae are thin, horizontal defects in the enamel, but they also do not directly contribute to the lateral spread of caries. Striae of Retzius are incremental lines in the enamel that represent the growth pattern of the tooth. They can act as pathways for the spread of caries, making them the most likely facilitator of lateral spread.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
