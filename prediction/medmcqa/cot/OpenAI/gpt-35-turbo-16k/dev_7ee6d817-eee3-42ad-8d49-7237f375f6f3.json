    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alcoholic hepatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption. To identify a biomarker of alcoholic hepatitis, we need to consider the liver enzymes that are commonly elevated in this condition. ALP (alkaline phosphatase) is not specific to alcoholic hepatitis and can be elevated in various liver diseases. AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) are also not specific to alcoholic hepatitis and can be elevated in other liver conditions as well. GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) is a liver enzyme that is commonly elevated in alcoholic hepatitis, making it a potential biomarker for this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
