    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of transfer of information from the RNA to the proteins is called protein synthesis. This process involves two main steps: transcription and translation. Transcription is the process of synthesizing an RNA molecule from a DNA template. During transcription, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA molecule. Translation, on the other hand, is the process of synthesizing a protein from an RNA template. During translation, the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA molecule is converted into a sequence of amino acids in the protein. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Translation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
