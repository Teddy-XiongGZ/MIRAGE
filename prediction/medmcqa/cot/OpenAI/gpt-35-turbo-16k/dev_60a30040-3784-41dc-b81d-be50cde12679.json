    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient complains of inability to chew by other teeth on the same side after planning an implant in the lower molar region. This suggests that there may be an issue with the occlusion or the way the teeth come together. The first step in treating this patient would be to check the occlusion in centric. This involves evaluating how the upper and lower teeth come together when the jaw is in its most stable and comfortable position. By checking the occlusion in centric, any discrepancies or interferences in the bite can be identified and addressed. Reducing the centric fossa or reducing the supporting cusp may be necessary steps depending on the findings during the occlusal evaluation, but they would not be the first step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
