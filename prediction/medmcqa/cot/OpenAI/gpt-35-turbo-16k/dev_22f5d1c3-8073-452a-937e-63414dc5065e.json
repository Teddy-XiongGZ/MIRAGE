    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is false for light cure composite, we need to evaluate each statement one by one. \\n\\nA. Held at a distance of 1 mm from the tooth: This statement is true. Light cure composite is typically held at a distance of 1 mm from the tooth surface to ensure proper curing.\\n\\nB. Use of orange glass shield for eye protection: This statement is true. Orange glass shields are commonly used during the light curing process to protect the eyes from harmful UV radiation.\\n\\nC. Polymerization reaction continues for a period of 72 hours: This statement is false. The polymerization reaction of light cure composite typically completes within a few seconds to a few minutes, not 72 hours.\\n\\nD. Adding increments of 1-2 mm: This statement is true. When applying light cure composite, it is common practice to add increments of 1-2 mm to ensure proper curing and minimize shrinkage. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the false statement for light cure composite is C. Polymerization reaction continues for a period of 72 hours.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
