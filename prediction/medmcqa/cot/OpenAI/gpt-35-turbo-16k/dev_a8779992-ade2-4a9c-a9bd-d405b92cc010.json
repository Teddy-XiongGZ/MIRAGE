    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingival connective tissue is a type of connective tissue that is found in the gums. It is composed of collagen fibers and fibroblasts. Collagen fibers provide strength and support to the tissue, while fibroblasts are responsible for producing and maintaining the collagen fibers. The question asks for the percentage of collagen fibers and fibroblasts present in gingival connective tissue. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the normal composition of gingival connective tissue. Studies have shown that gingival connective tissue typically contains around 60-65% collagen fibers and 5-10% fibroblasts. Looking at the given choices, option A (60% & 5%) and option C (60% & 10%) both fall within the normal range for collagen fibers and fibroblasts. However, option B (65% & 5%) and option D (65% & 10%) have a higher percentage of collagen fibers, which is not consistent with the normal composition of gingival connective tissue. Therefore, the correct answer is option A (60% & 5%).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
