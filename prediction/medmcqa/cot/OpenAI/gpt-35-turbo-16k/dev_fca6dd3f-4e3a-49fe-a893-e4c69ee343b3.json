    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in the treatment of an avulsed tooth is to clean the root surface. This is necessary to remove any debris or contaminants that may be present. Option A suggests cleaning the root surface with saline and reimplanting the tooth. This is a reasonable approach as saline can help remove debris and reimplantation is important to preserve the tooth. Option B suggests cleaning and curetting the root surface before reimplantation. Curettage involves scraping the root surface to remove any remaining tissue or debris. While this may be necessary in some cases, it is not the first-line treatment for an avulsed tooth. Option C suggests cleaning the root surface, performing root canal treatment (RCT), and then reimplanting the tooth. RCT is typically not performed immediately after avulsion, as it is more important to reimplant the tooth as soon as possible. Option D suggests scrubbing the root surface before reimplantation. Scrubbing can cause damage to the root surface and is not recommended. Based on these considerations, the most appropriate treatment for the 8-year-old child with an avulsed tooth that is contaminated with debris would be option A: Clean root surface with saline and reimplant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
