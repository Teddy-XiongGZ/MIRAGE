    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gene editing is a process of making changes to the DNA sequence of an organism. There are several tools used in gene editing, but the most commonly used and well-known tool is CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). CRISPR is a revolutionary gene editing technology that allows scientists to make precise changes to the DNA of living organisms. It works by using a protein called Cas9, which acts as a pair of molecular scissors to cut the DNA at a specific location. After the DNA is cut, the cell's own repair machinery can be used to introduce changes to the DNA sequence. Gene Xpe, Big Data, and HealthCare App are not tools used in gene editing, so they can be eliminated as options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
