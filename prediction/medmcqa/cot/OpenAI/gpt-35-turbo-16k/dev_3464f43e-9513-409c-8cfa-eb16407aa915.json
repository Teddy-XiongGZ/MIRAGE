    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Shoulder dystocia is a complication that occurs during childbirth when the baby's shoulder gets stuck behind the mother's pubic bone. It is an emergency situation that requires immediate management. The goal of management is to safely deliver the baby without causing harm to the mother or the baby. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Fundal pressure: Fundal pressure involves applying pressure on the mother's abdomen to help deliver the baby. However, in the case of shoulder dystocia, fundal pressure is not recommended as it can worsen the situation by further impacting the baby's shoulder.\\n\\nB. Mc Roberts manoeuvre: The Mc Roberts manoeuvre is a technique used to relieve shoulder dystocia. It involves flexing the mother's hips and thighs towards her abdomen to create more space for the baby's shoulder to pass through. This manoeuvre is commonly used in the management of shoulder dystocia.\\n\\nC. Suprapubic pressure: Suprapubic pressure is another technique used to manage shoulder dystocia. It involves applying pressure just above the mother's pubic bone to help dislodge the baby's shoulder. This technique is often effective in resolving shoulder dystocia.\\n\\nD. Woods manoeuvre: The Woods manoeuvre is not a recognized technique for managing shoulder dystocia. It is not a recommended approach and is not commonly used in clinical practice.\\n\\nBased on the above information, it can be concluded that the option that is not done in the management of shoulder dystocia is D. Woods manoeuvre.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
