    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prinzmetal's angina, also known as variant angina, is a type of angina that is caused by coronary artery spasm rather than atherosclerosis. It typically occurs at rest and is often associated with transient ST-segment elevation on the ECG. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Generally Right Coronary Artery presents as inferior wall MI: This statement is not accurate for Prinzmetal's angina. Prinzmetal's angina is not typically associated with myocardial infarction.\\n\\nB. Coronary artery spasm most commonly occurs distal to atherosclerotic area: This statement is accurate. Coronary artery spasm in Prinzmetal's angina commonly occurs distal to the atherosclerotic area.\\n\\nC. No changes in ECG, Q wave become normal after few hours: This statement is not accurate. Prinzmetal's angina is associated with transient ST-segment elevation on the ECG, not Q wave changes.\\n\\nD. All of the above: Based on the evaluation of the previous options, the correct answer is not D. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
