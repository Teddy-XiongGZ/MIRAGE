    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulpotomy is a dental procedure that involves the removal of the coronal portion of the dental pulp, leaving the vital root pulp intact. It is commonly performed in young permanent teeth with deep caries or trauma. The purpose of pulpotomy in young permanent teeth is to preserve the vitality of the remaining root pulp while removing the infected or inflamed coronal pulp.

Pulpotomy does not directly prevent tooth fracture or induce root formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
