    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve is responsible for processing sensory information from the face and head. It receives input from the three branches of the trigeminal nerve: ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular. The trigeminal nerve carries various sensations from the face and head, including touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception. Proprioception refers to the sense of the position and movement of our body parts. Since the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve receives proprioceptive input, it is not correct to say that proprioception is not perceived by this nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
