    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Early fusion of the coronal suture refers to the premature closure of the suture that runs from one ear to the other across the top of the head. This closure can lead to abnormal skull shape. Brachycephaly is a condition characterized by a wide and short head shape, which is not caused by early fusion of the coronal suture. Oxycephaly is a condition characterized by a tower-like shape of the skull, which is also not caused by early fusion of the coronal suture. Trigonocephaly is a condition characterized by a triangular shape of the forehead, which is caused by premature fusion of the metopic suture, not the coronal suture. Scaphocephaly is a condition characterized by a long and narrow head shape, which is caused by premature fusion of the sagittal suture, not the coronal suture. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the given choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
