    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The external carotid artery is a major blood vessel that supplies blood to the head and neck region. It gives rise to several branches, including those that supply the nasal septum. To determine which branch is not involved in supplying the nasal septum, we need to identify the branches of the external carotid artery that do supply the nasal septum and then eliminate them from the given choices. The branches of the external carotid artery that supply the nasal septum include the sphenopalatine artery, greater palatine artery, and anterior ethmoidal artery. The superior labial artery does not supply the nasal septum. Therefore, the answer is C. superior labial.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
