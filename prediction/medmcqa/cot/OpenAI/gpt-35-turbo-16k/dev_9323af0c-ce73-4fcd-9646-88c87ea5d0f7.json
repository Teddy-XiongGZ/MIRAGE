    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to consider the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient had abdominal pain the previous week, which was investigated with an ultrasound (USG) and found to be normal. Now, the patient is presenting with a loss of vision. It is important to note that the examination is normal. Given these symptoms, it is unlikely that the patient is malingering, as malingering involves intentionally feigning or exaggerating symptoms for secondary gain. Similarly, being a masochist or hypochondriac does not explain the symptoms of abdominal pain and loss of vision. Anxiety disorder, on the other hand, can manifest with physical symptoms such as abdominal pain and can also cause visual disturbances. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is anxiety disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
