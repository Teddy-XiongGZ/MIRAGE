    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the National Water Supply and Sanitation programme, a problem village is defined as a village that has specific issues related to water supply and sanitation. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Distance of safe water is greater than 1.6 Km: This could be a valid criterion for defining a problem village as it indicates that the village is located far from a safe water source.\\n\\nB. Water is exposed to the risk of cholera: This could also be a valid criterion as it indicates that the water in the village is contaminated and poses a health risk.\\n\\nC. Water source has excess iron and heavy metals: This could be another valid criterion as it indicates that the water source is polluted with harmful substances.\\n\\nD. Water infested with Guinea worm: This option seems to be the odd one out as Guinea worm infestation is a specific problem caused by a parasitic worm and may not be a general criterion for defining a problem village in the context of the National Water Supply and Sanitation programme.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the answer is D. Water infested with Guinea worm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
