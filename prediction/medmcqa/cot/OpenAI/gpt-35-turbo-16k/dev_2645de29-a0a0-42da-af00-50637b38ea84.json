    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The transmission of pain from the tooth to the brain involves the sensory nerves. There are two main types of sensory nerve fibers involved in pain transmission: A delta fibers and C fibers. A delta fibers are myelinated and transmit sharp, fast pain signals, while C fibers are unmyelinated and transmit dull, slow pain signals. Since the pain described in the question is short and sharp, it is likely transmitted by A delta fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
