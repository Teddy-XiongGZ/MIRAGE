    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibrinolytics are medications used to dissolve blood clots. In cases of overdosage of fibrinolytics, the goal is to counteract the excessive clot dissolution. Epsilon amino Caproic Acid (EACA) and Tranexamic Acid are both antifibrinolytic agents that can be used to inhibit the breakdown of clots. DDAVP (Desmopressin) is a medication that promotes the release of von Willebrand factor, which helps with clot formation. FFP (Fresh Frozen Plasma) contains clotting factors and can be used to replenish the clotting factors that may have been depleted due to excessive clot dissolution. Therefore, the answer is C. DDAVP, as it is not used in the management of overdosage of fibrinolytics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
