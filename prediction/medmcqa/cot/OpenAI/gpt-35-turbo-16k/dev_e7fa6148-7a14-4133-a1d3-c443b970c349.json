    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most common chances of pulpal exposure if the pulpal floor is made perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth, we need to consider the anatomy and positioning of the teeth. The pulpal floor refers to the floor of the pulp chamber within the tooth. When the pulpal floor is perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth, it means that it is positioned horizontally. A. Maxillary 1st premolar: The pulpal floor of the maxillary 1st premolar is typically inclined buccally (towards the cheek) rather than being perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Therefore, this is not the most common chance of pulpal exposure in this scenario. B. Maxillary 1st molar: The pulpal floor of the maxillary 1st molar is typically inclined mesially (towards the midline) rather than being perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Therefore, this is not the most common chance of pulpal exposure in this scenario. C. Mandibular 1st premolar: The pulpal floor of the mandibular 1st premolar is typically inclined lingually (towards the tongue) rather than being perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Therefore, this is not the most common chance of pulpal exposure in this scenario. D. Mandibular 2nd premolar: The pulpal floor of the mandibular 2nd premolar is typically perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Therefore, this is the most common chance of pulpal exposure if the pulpal floor is made perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Mandibular 2nd premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
