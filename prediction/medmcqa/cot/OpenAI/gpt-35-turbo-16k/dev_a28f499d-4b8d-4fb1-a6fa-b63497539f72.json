    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Treatment resins are given to provide support and stability to edentulous ridges. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Abused ridges: Treatment resins may be used to restore and stabilize abused ridges, but this is not the primary indication for their use.\\n\\nB. Flabby ridges: Treatment resins are commonly used to provide support and stability to flabby ridges, which are characterized by excessive soft tissue.\\n\\nC. Ridges with large tori on them: Large tori on the ridges may require surgical removal rather than treatment resins.\\n\\nD. Ridges with bony resorption: Treatment resins are often used to compensate for the loss of bone in ridges with bony resorption, providing support and stability.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Ridges with bony resorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
