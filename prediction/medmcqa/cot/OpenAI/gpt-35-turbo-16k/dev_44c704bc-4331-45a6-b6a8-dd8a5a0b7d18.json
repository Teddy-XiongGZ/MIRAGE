    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hypothalamus is a region of the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating hormone secretion. It produces and releases various hormones that either stimulate or inhibit the release of other hormones from the pituitary gland. In this question, we are asked to identify which hormone(s) are under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. Prolactin is a hormone that is primarily responsible for milk production in females. It is under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. When the hypothalamus releases dopamine, it inhibits the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. Therefore, option A is correct. Growth hormone, also known as somatotropin, is responsible for stimulating growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration. It is not under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. In fact, the hypothalamus releases growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) to stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is option B. Only prolactin is under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Only prolactin\"}"
