    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, including the heart valves. It is most commonly caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and attaching to damaged heart valves or other areas of the heart. Septic abortion is a condition where there is an infection of the uterus following an abortion. The infection can spread to the bloodstream and potentially affect the heart valves. In septic abortion, the most likely route of infection is through the venous system, specifically the uterine veins. From the given options, the valve most likely to be involved in infective endocarditis following a septic abortion is the Tricuspid valve. This is because the uterine veins drain into the systemic venous circulation, which includes the inferior vena cava and right atrium. The tricuspid valve is the valve between the right atrium and right ventricle, and it is the valve most likely to be exposed to bacteria from the bloodstream in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Tricuspid valve.\"}"
