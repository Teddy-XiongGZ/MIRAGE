    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The shape of the 1st Maxillary molar can be determined by considering its occlusal surface. Let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. Rhomboid: A rhomboid shape is characterized by having four sides of equal length, but the occlusal surface of the 1st Maxillary molar is not typically rhomboid in shape. \\n\\nB. Rounded triangular: This shape is characterized by having three sides, with one side being rounded. The occlusal surface of the 1st Maxillary molar is not typically rounded triangular in shape. \\n\\nC. Trapezoid: A trapezoid shape is characterized by having four sides, with one pair of opposite sides being parallel. The occlusal surface of the 1st Maxillary molar is often trapezoid in shape, with the mesial side being shorter than the distal side. \\n\\nD. Square: A square shape is characterized by having four sides of equal length and four right angles. The occlusal surface of the 1st Maxillary molar is not typically square in shape. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is C. Trapezoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
