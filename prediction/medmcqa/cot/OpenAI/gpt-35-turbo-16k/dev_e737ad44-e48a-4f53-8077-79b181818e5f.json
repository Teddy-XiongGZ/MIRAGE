    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Weber-Fechner law is a principle in psychophysics that relates the intensity of a stimulus to the perceived magnitude of that stimulus. It states that the perceived magnitude of a stimulus is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. This means that as the intensity of a stimulus increases, the perceived magnitude of that stimulus increases, but at a decreasing rate. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Intensity of stimulus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
