    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cobalt-Chromium alloys are commonly used in dentistry and orthopedic implants. To determine the composition of Cobalt-Chromium alloys, we need to consider the percentages of cobalt and chromium in the alloy. Option A states that the alloy contains 30% cobalt and 60% chromium. Option B states that the alloy contains 60% cobalt and 30% chromium. Option C states that the alloy contains 1% palladium, which is not relevant to the composition of Cobalt-Chromium alloys. Option D states that the alloy contains 20% gold, which is also not relevant to the composition of Cobalt-Chromium alloys. Therefore, the correct answer is either A or B, depending on the specific composition of the Cobalt-Chromium alloy being referred to.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
