    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiolucent areas around several mandibular teeth indicate the presence of bone loss or destruction. The fact that all the teeth tested vital on the electric pulp tester suggests that the pulp tissue is still alive and functioning. This rules out options A (multiple granulomas), C (chronic periapical abscesses), and D (bone hypoplasias associated with opalescent teeth) as these conditions would typically cause pulp necrosis. Periapical osteofibroses is a condition characterized by the formation of fibrous tissue in response to chronic inflammation, leading to radiolucent areas around the teeth. Therefore, the correct answer is B (Periapical osteofibroses).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
