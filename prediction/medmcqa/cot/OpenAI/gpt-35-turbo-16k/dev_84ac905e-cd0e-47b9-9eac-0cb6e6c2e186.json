    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone disorder characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. The treatment approach for fibrous dysplasia depends on various factors such as the location, size, and symptoms associated with the lesion. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Radical resection of lesion: Radical resection involves complete removal of the lesion. While this may be an option for some cases, it is not the standard treatment for fibrous dysplasia.\\n\\nB. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is not typically used as a primary treatment for fibrous dysplasia.\\n\\nC. If the lesion is small, dissection is done, if the lesion is large cosmetic surgery has to be carried out: This option suggests that dissection may be done for small lesions and cosmetic surgery for large lesions. However, this is not a standard treatment approach for fibrous dysplasia.\\n\\nD. Cryosurgery: Cryosurgery involves freezing the lesion to destroy abnormal tissue. While this may be considered as a treatment option for fibrous dysplasia, it is not the most commonly used approach.\\n\\nConsidering the options provided, none of them align with the standard treatment approach for fibrous dysplasia. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
