    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibroblasts are connective tissue cells that are responsible for producing and secreting various components of the extracellular matrix. Collagen is the main protein component of the extracellular matrix. There are different types of collagen, each with specific functions and distribution in the body. To determine which type of collagen fibroblasts in the cell-rich zone primarily secrete, we need to consider the characteristics and functions of each type of collagen. Type I collagen is the most abundant collagen in the body and is found in various tissues, including skin, tendons, and bones. It provides strength and support to these tissues. Type VI collagen is a minor component of the extracellular matrix and is mainly found in connective tissues associated with basement membranes. It helps to anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. Type V collagen is also a minor component of the extracellular matrix and is found in various tissues, including skin, tendons, and blood vessels. It helps to regulate the assembly and organization of other collagen types. Type IV collagen is a major component of basement membranes and is found in tissues such as the kidney, lung, and skin. It provides structural support and acts as a filtration barrier. Based on the functions and distribution of these collagen types, the most likely answer is A. Type I collagen. Fibroblasts in the cell-rich zone primarily secrete Type I collagen to provide strength and support to the surrounding tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
