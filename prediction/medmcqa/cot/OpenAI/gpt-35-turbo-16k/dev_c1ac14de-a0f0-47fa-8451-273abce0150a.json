    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the retina of the eye. It can spread to other parts of the body through various modes. To determine the most common mode of spread, we need to consider the characteristics of retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is known to have a propensity for local invasion and distant metastasis. A. Optic nerve invasion: Retinoblastoma can invade the optic nerve, which is the nerve that connects the eye to the brain. However, optic nerve invasion is not the most common mode of spread. B. Lymphatics: Lymphatic spread refers to the spread of cancer cells through the lymphatic system. While lymphatic spread can occur in retinoblastoma, it is not the most common mode of spread. C. Vascular: Vascular spread refers to the spread of cancer cells through the blood vessels. Retinoblastoma has a high propensity for vascular spread, and it is considered the most common mode of spread. D. Direct invasion: Direct invasion refers to the spread of cancer cells into adjacent tissues. While direct invasion can occur in retinoblastoma, it is not the most common mode of spread. Based on the above considerations, the most common mode of spread of retinoblastoma is vascular spread.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
