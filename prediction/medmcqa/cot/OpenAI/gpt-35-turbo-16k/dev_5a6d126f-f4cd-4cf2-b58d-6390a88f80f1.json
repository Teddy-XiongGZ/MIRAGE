    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary teeth, also known as baby teeth, are the first set of teeth that erupt in a child's mouth. They are eventually replaced by permanent teeth. To determine which primary teeth are most commonly missing, we need to consider the eruption pattern and prevalence of missing teeth. 1. Maxillary central incisors: These are the two front teeth in the upper jaw. They usually erupt between 8-12 months of age. While it is possible for these teeth to be missing, it is not the most common occurrence. 2. Mandibular central incisors: These are the two front teeth in the lower jaw. They also usually erupt between 8-12 months of age. Similar to the maxillary central incisors, it is possible for these teeth to be missing, but it is not the most common occurrence. 3. Maxillary lateral incisors: These are the teeth next to the central incisors in the upper jaw. They usually erupt between 9-13 months of age. Missing maxillary lateral incisors are more common than missing central incisors. 4. Maxillary canines: These are the teeth on either side of the lateral incisors in the upper jaw. They usually erupt between 16-22 months of age. Missing maxillary canines are less common than missing lateral incisors. Based on the eruption pattern and prevalence, the most commonly missing primary teeth are the maxillary lateral incisors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Maxillary lateral incisors\"}"
