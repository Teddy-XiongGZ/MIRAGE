    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance can lead to various cardiac conditions. Sudden death is a sudden and unexpected loss of life, which may not necessarily be related to myocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance. Stable angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs with physical exertion or emotional stress and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Unstable angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs at rest or with minimal exertion and is usually more severe and prolonged than stable angina. Myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, occurs when there is a complete blockage of blood flow to a part of the heart muscle, leading to the death of that muscle. Given the options, the most appropriate answer would be C. Unstable angina, as it specifically refers to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
