This statement is true as articaine is an amide local anesthetic that undergoes metabolism in both plasma and liver.\\n\\nStatement B: The plasma half-life of articaine is 90 minutes. This statement is true as the plasma half-life of articaine is indeed around 90 minutes.\\n\\nStatement C: Infiltration of articaine produces adequate anesthesia in primary molars, eliminating the need for block anesthesia. This statement is true as articaine infiltration can provide sufficient anesthesia in primary molars, reducing the need for block anesthesia.\\n\\nStatement D: More breakdown of articaine causes less toxicity. This statement is false as increased breakdown of articaine can actually lead to increased toxicity.\\n\\nStep 2: Based on the analysis, the statement that is NOT true about the use of articaine in a child is statement D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
