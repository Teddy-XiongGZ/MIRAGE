    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrates are commonly used in the treatment of angina, which is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Nitrates work by dilating the blood vessels, including the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. This leads to an increase in blood flow to the heart, which can relieve the symptoms of angina. Nitrates primarily act by causing coronary vasodilation, which is the widening of the coronary arteries. This allows more blood to flow through the arteries and reach the heart muscle, improving oxygen supply. Therefore, the major mechanism of action of nitrates in the acute attack of angina is coronary vasodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
