    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Holocrine glands are a type of exocrine glands that release their secretions by the rupture of the entire glandular cell. To identify a marker for holocrine glands, we need to consider the characteristics of these glands. Holocrine glands are characterized by the accumulation of secretory products within the cytoplasm of the glandular cells. When the glandular cells rupture, the accumulated secretions are released. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, B, and C, as they do not represent the accumulation and rupture of glandular cells. Option D remains as a potential marker for holocrine glands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
