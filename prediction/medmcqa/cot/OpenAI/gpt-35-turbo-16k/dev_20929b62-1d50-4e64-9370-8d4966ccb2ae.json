    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is carotico-cavernous fistula. Proptosis and pain in the eye following trauma, along with a bruise on the eye and forehead, are suggestive of this condition. Carotico-cavernous fistula is an abnormal connection between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, which can occur as a result of trauma. It can lead to proptosis (bulging of the eye), pain, and other symptoms. Fracture of the sphenoid bone, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and internal carotid artery aneurysm are less likely based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
