    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most outer covering of nerve fibers is called the neurolemma. The neurolemma is also known as the outermost layer of the Schwann cell. It is responsible for providing structural support and protection to the nerve fiber. The perineurium is a connective tissue layer that surrounds a bundle of nerve fibers, known as a fascicle. The axolemma is the plasma membrane of the axon, which is the long, slender part of the nerve cell responsible for transmitting electrical signals. The myelin sheath is a fatty substance that surrounds and insulates the axon, providing insulation and increasing the speed of nerve impulse conduction. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Neurolemma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
