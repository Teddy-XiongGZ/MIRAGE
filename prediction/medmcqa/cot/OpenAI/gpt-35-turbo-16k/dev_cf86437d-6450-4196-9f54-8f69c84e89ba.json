    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Stress breakers are components used in denture construction to distribute and absorb forces exerted on the denture. They are typically used in complete dentures to minimize the risk of denture fracture. However, in the case of partial dentures, stress breakers are not commonly used. Now let's evaluate each option to determine why stress breakers are not used in partial denture construction: A. They are expensive: The cost of a component is not typically the primary reason for its exclusion in dental treatment. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer. B. Increase the vertical dimension: The vertical dimension refers to the distance between the upper and lower jaws when the teeth are in occlusion. Increasing the vertical dimension can lead to issues with the patient's bite and overall comfort. While stress breakers may have an effect on the vertical dimension, it is not the primary reason for their exclusion in partial denture construction. C. They are difficult to design and fabricate: This option suggests that stress breakers are challenging to design and fabricate, which could be a reason for their exclusion in partial denture construction. However, it is important to consider other factors as well. D. Harmful effect on the abutment: An abutment is a natural tooth or dental implant that supports a dental prosthesis. If stress breakers were to have a harmful effect on the abutment, it could compromise the stability and longevity of the partial denture. This is a plausible reason for not using stress breakers in partial denture construction. Considering the options provided, the most likely reason why stress breakers are not used in partial denture construction is D. Harmful effect on the abutment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
