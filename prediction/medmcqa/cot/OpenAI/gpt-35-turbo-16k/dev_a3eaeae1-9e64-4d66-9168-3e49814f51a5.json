    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor that arises from the epithelial cells of the enamel organ. It typically presents as a slow-growing, painless swelling in the jaw. Histomorphologic features of ameloblastoma include peripheral palisading and central stellate reticulum. The peripheral palisading consists of a cellular strand of columnar or cuboidal cells that line up along the periphery of the tumor islands. The central stellate reticulum consists of loosely arranged, stellate-shaped cells with abundant cytoplasm. Based on these features, the correct answer is C. Peripheral palisading cellular strand with peripheral loose stellate reticulum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
