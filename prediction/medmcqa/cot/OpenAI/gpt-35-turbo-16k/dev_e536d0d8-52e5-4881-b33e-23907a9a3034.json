    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that arises from osteoblasts. It typically presents as a destructive lesion on radiographic imaging. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Discrete radiolucency with regular borders: This is not a typical appearance of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma usually presents as an aggressive lesion with irregular borders.\\n\\nB. Multicystic radiolucency with a soap bubble appearance with an irregular peripheral border: This is not a typical appearance of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma usually presents as a solid mass rather than a cystic lesion.\\n\\nC. Sunburst pattern with radiopaque strands extending from the cortical plates: This is a characteristic radiographic appearance of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma often shows a sunburst pattern with radiopaque strands extending from the cortical plates due to aggressive bone formation.\\n\\nD. Cotton wool appearance with an irregular peripheral border: This is not a typical appearance of osteosarcoma. Cotton wool appearance is more commonly seen in conditions like Paget's disease of bone. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Sunburst pattern with radiopaque strands extending from the cortical plates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
