    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High Cu alloys are known for their excellent corrosion resistance, so option C is not correct. High tensile strength is also a characteristic of high Cu alloys, so option A is not correct. Low creep refers to the resistance of a material to deformation under constant stress over time. Since high Cu alloys have a high melting point and good mechanical properties, they typically exhibit low creep. Therefore, option B is not correct. Based on this, the correct answer is D. None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
