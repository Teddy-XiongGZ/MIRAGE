    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The adrenal gland is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal medulla, which is responsible for the production and release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), is directly innervated by preganglionic fibers from the sympathetic chain. These preganglionic fibers originate from the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Therefore, option B is correct. Option A is incorrect because the release of catecholamines is indeed affected by the nerve supply to the adrenals. Option C is incorrect because although the adrenal cortex primarily has endocrine functions, it still receives nerve supply. Option D is incorrect because the adrenal medulla does have nerve supply.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
