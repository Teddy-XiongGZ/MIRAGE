    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The low sodium level (hyponatremia) and high potassium level (hyperkalemia) in this neonate with ambiguous genitalia suggest a possible diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands, leading to a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone production. The low sodium level and high potassium level are consistent with aldosterone deficiency. The next step in management would be to administer hydrocortisone, which is a glucocorticoid that can replace the deficient cortisol. Hydrocortisone administration will help to correct the electrolyte imbalance and manage the underlying condition. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Hydrocortisone administration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
