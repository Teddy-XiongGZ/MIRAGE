    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An indirect retainer is a component of a removable partial denture that helps to stabilize and prevent displacement of the denture base. It is typically placed in a location that is opposite to the direction of the potential displacement forces. The fulcrum line is the imaginary line around which the denture rotates during function. Placing the indirect retainer near the fulcrum line would help to counteract the rotational forces and provide stability to the denture. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Near fulcrum line.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
