    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To diagnose alcoholic hepatitis in the laboratory, we need to look for specific markers that indicate liver damage. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a marker of liver function, but it is not specific to alcoholic hepatitis. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are enzymes that are released into the bloodstream when there is liver damage, including alcoholic hepatitis. However, the most specific marker for alcoholic hepatitis is gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). GGT levels are typically elevated in individuals with alcoholic liver disease. Therefore, the correct answer is D. GGT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
