    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The enamel is the outermost layer of the tooth and is composed mainly of minerals, primarily hydroxyapatite. It does not contain any living cells or blood vessels. Therefore, it cannot repair itself once it is damaged. The formative cells responsible for enamel formation, called ameloblasts, are lost once the enamel is completely formed. This means that there are no remaining cells in the enamel to initiate repair. Additionally, the enamel has no direct connection with the active cells of the dental pulp, which is responsible for the formation of dentin and repair of the tooth structure. Therefore, the correct answer is D. It has no direct connection with the active cells of the dental pulp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
