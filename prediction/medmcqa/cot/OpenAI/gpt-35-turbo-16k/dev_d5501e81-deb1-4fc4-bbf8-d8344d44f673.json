    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Swollen joint, anemic, loose teeth, and dentin dysplasia are symptoms that can be seen in a condition called scurvy. Scurvy is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein that helps in the formation of connective tissues, including those found in joints and teeth. Anemia can also occur due to vitamin C deficiency as it plays a role in the absorption of iron. Vitamin D deficiency can cause bone and teeth problems, but it does not directly cause swollen joints or anemia. Vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to a condition called beriberi, which primarily affects the nervous system and cardiovascular system, but it does not cause swollen joints, loose teeth, or dentin dysplasia.
