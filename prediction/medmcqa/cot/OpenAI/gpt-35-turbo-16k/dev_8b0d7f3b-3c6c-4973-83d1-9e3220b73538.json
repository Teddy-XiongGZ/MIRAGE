    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron metabolism. It decreases iron absorption by inhibiting the function of certain proteins involved in iron transport. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Hephaestin: Hephaestin is an enzyme involved in iron transport, specifically in the release of iron from enterocytes into the bloodstream. However, hepcidin does not directly inhibit hephaestin.\\n\\nB. Ferropoin: Ferropoin is not a known protein involved in iron transport, so hepcidin does not inhibit it.\\n\\nC. Divalent metal ion transporter: Divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1) is responsible for the uptake of iron from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes. Hepcidin inhibits the function of DMT1, reducing iron absorption.\\n\\nD. Transferrin: Transferrin is a protein that binds to iron in the bloodstream and transports it to cells. Hepcidin does not directly inhibit transferrin.\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is C. Divalent metal ion transporter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
