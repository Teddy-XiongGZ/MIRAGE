    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In alpha-thalassemia trait, there is a decreased production of alpha-globin chains. This leads to an excess of beta-globin chains, which can form tetramers called hemoglobin H (HbH). Electrophoresis in alpha-thalassemia trait typically shows increased HbH and decreased HbA. However, HbF and HbA2 levels are usually normal in alpha-thalassemia trait.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Normal HbF and normal HbA2\"}"
