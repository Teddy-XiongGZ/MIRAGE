    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radiation affects all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). Teratoid cysts are composed of tissues derived from all three germ layers, so radiation can affect teratoid cysts. Dermoid cysts are also composed of tissues derived from all three germ layers, so radiation can affect dermoid cysts. Thyroglossal cysts are derived from the endoderm and mesoderm, so radiation can affect thyroglossal cysts. Branchial cysts are derived from the ectoderm and mesoderm, so radiation can affect branchial cysts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/C/D\"}"
