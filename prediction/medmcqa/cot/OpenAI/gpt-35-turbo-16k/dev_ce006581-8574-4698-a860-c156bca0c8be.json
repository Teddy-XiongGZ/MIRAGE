    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for an estimated prevalence, we can use the formula: CI = estimated prevalence \u00b1 (Z * sqrt((estimated prevalence * (1 - estimated prevalence)) / sample size)), where Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is approximately 1.96. Plugging in the values, CI = 10% \u00b1 (1.96 * sqrt((10% * (1 - 10%)) / 100)). Calculating this, we get CI = 10% \u00b1 1.96 * sqrt(0.09) = 10% \u00b1 1.96 * 0.3 = 10% \u00b1 0.588 = (9.412%, 10.588%). Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for an estimated prevalence of 10% and a sample size of 100 is (9.412%, 10.588%).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 18-Feb\"}"
