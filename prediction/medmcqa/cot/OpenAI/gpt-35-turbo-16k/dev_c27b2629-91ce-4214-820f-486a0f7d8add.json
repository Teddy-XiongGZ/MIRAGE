    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The rake angle refers to the angle between the cutting edge of a tool and a reference plane perpendicular to the workpiece surface. A positive rake angle means that the cutting edge is inclined in the direction of the cutting motion, while a negative rake angle means that the cutting edge is inclined in the opposite direction. In this case, negative rake angle means that the rake face is behind the radial line. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
