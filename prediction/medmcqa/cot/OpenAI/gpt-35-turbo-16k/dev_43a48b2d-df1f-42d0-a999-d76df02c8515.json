    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a pregnant woman with placenta previa who is experiencing acute shock, the priority is to stabilize the patient and ensure a safe delivery. General anesthesia is preferred in this situation as it provides rapid induction and allows for airway control. Spinal anesthesia may not be suitable in this case as it can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, which can be detrimental to the patient. Sedation and epidural analgesia may not be appropriate as they do not provide the necessary level of anesthesia for a caesarean section. Therefore, the most appropriate choice in this scenario would be option C: General anesthesia with IV induction by propofol followed by maintenance with fluranes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
