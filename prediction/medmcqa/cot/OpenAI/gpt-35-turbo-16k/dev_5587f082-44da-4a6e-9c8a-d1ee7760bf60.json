    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The AOD 450 value is an indicator of fetal hemolytic disease. In this case, the AOD 450 value of 0.20 is at the top of the third zone of the Liley curve, which suggests severe fetal anemia. The appropriate management for severe fetal anemia is intrauterine transfusion. This procedure involves transfusing blood directly into the fetal circulation to correct the anemia. Immediate delivery is not the preferred option at this gestational age as the fetus may not be mature enough to survive outside the womb. Repeat amniocentesis after 1 week may not be necessary as the severity of the anemia is already established. Plasmapheresis is not indicated in this case as it is used for the treatment of maternal antibodies in cases of Rh isoimmunization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Intrauterine transfusion\"}"
