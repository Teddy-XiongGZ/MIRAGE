    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) but normal prothrombin time (PT). Prolonged PTT indicates a deficiency in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Vitamin K deficiency primarily affects the extrinsic pathway, so it is unlikely to be the cause. Acquired liver disease can lead to a deficiency in clotting factors, including factors in the intrinsic pathway, but the patient has no other signs or symptoms of liver disease. Factor XII deficiency is a rare disorder that can cause a prolonged PTT, but it is unlikely in this case as the patient has no family history of bleeding. Mild hemophilia A is a possibility as it can cause a prolonged PTT, but it is less likely than acquired liver disease. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's prolonged PTT is acquired liver disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Acquired liver disease\"}"
