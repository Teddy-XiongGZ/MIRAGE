    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During 3rd molar surgical extraction, the distal incision is made to gain access to the tooth. The incision is typically made on the buccal (cheek) side of the tooth. The purpose of curving the incision buccally is to avoid injury to nearby structures. A. Buccal artery: The buccal artery is located in the cheek and runs close to the area where the incision is made. Curving the incision buccally helps to avoid injury to the buccal artery. B. Lingual nerve: The lingual nerve is located on the lingual (tongue) side of the lower jaw. It is not at risk of injury during a distal incision made on the buccal side. C. Temporalis fibers: The temporalis muscle is located on the side of the head and is not at risk of injury during a distal incision made on the buccal side. D. BFP (Buccal Fat Pad): The buccal fat pad is a structure located in the cheek. It is not at risk of injury during a distal incision made on the buccal side. Based on the above information, the correct answer is A. Buccal artery, as curving the incision buccally helps to prevent injury to this structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
