    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"5' capping is a process in which a modified guanine nucleotide is added to the 5' end of RNA molecules. It is typically required for mRNA molecules to protect them from degradation and facilitate their translation. tRNA molecules do not undergo 5' capping as they have a different structure and function. mRNA for histone, U6 snRNA, and siRNA are all types of RNA molecules that undergo 5' capping. Therefore, the answer is A. tRNA of alanine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
