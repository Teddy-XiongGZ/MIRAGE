    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"TMJ ankylosis refers to the fusion or immobility of the temporomandibular joint. Let's analyze each option to determine which one is not a theory of TMJ ankylosis:\\n\\nA. Calcification in the soft tissues around the joint space: Calcification in the soft tissues around the joint space can contribute to TMJ ankylosis by causing stiffness and limited movement of the joint.\\n\\nB. Synovial fluid attracting calcium ions: Synovial fluid attracting calcium ions can lead to the formation of calcium deposits in the joint, which can contribute to TMJ ankylosis.\\n\\nC. Lateral displacement of fracture condyle with fusion with zygomatic bone: Lateral displacement of fracture condyle with fusion with the zygomatic bone can result in TMJ ankylosis.\\n\\nD. Condylar burst: Condylar burst refers to a fracture of the condyle, which can lead to TMJ ankylosis. \\n\\nBased on the analysis, all of the options (A, B, C, and D) are theories of TMJ ankylosis. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
