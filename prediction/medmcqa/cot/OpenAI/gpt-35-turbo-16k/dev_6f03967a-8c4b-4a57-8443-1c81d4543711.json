    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The treatment of choice for primary grade V vesicoureteric reflux involving both kidneys in a 6 month old boy can be determined by considering the severity of the condition and the potential risks and benefits of each treatment option. Grade V vesicoureteric reflux is the most severe form of reflux, where urine flows back into the kidneys with high pressure. Antibiotic prophylaxis alone may not be sufficient to prevent kidney damage in this case. Ureteric reimplantation is a surgical procedure where the ureters are repositioned to prevent reflux. This is a commonly performed procedure for severe cases of vesicoureteric reflux. Cystoscopy followed by subureteric injection of teflon is a minimally invasive procedure where a substance is injected near the ureter to create a barrier and prevent reflux. Bilateral ureterostomies involve creating an opening in the abdomen to divert urine directly from the ureters. This is a more invasive procedure and is usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed. Considering the age of the patient and the severity of the condition, the most appropriate treatment option would be ureteric reimplantation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
