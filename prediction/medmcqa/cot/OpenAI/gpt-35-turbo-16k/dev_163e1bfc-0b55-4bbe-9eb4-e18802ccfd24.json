    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mesial marginal developmental groove is a specific anatomical feature seen in certain teeth. To determine which tooth it is seen in, we need to consider the location of the groove. The term 'mesial' refers to the side of the tooth that is closer to the midline of the dental arch. The term 'marginal' refers to the edge or border of the tooth. Therefore, the mesial marginal developmental groove is a groove that is located on the mesial (inner) surface of the tooth near the marginal (border) area. Now, let's consider the options: A. Maxillary 1st premolar: This tooth is located towards the back of the mouth and does not have a mesial marginal developmental groove. B. Mandibular lateral incisor: This tooth is located in the lower front of the mouth and does not have a mesial marginal developmental groove. C. Maxillary lateral incisor: This tooth is located in the upper front of the mouth and does not have a mesial marginal developmental groove. D. Mandibular 1st premolar: This tooth is located towards the back of the mouth and does have a mesial marginal developmental groove. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Mandibular 1st premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
