    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A diffuse spreading inflammatory lesion is typically caused by the action of bacterial enzymes that break down the extracellular matrix and allow the bacteria to spread. Among the given options, coagulase, hyaluronidase, peroxidase, and bradykinin, the enzyme that is most likely responsible for this type of lesion is hyaluronidase. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme produced by certain bacteria that breaks down hyaluronic acid, a major component of the extracellular matrix. This breakdown of the extracellular matrix allows the bacteria to spread and cause a diffuse inflammatory response. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Hyaluronidase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
