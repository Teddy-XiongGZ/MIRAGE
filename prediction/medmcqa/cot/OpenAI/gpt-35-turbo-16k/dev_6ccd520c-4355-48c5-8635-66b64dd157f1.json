    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anteroposterior relation of jaws can be measured by different angles. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. ANB angle: This angle measures the relationship between the maxilla (A point) and the mandible (B point) in relation to the cranial base (N point). While it provides information about the anteroposterior position of the jaws, it does not directly measure the relation between the jaws themselves.\\n\\nB. Angle between SN & FH Plane: This angle measures the inclination of the cranial base (SN plane) in relation to the Frankfort horizontal plane (FH plane). It does not directly measure the anteroposterior relation of the jaws.\\n\\nC. Angle between SN & mandibular plane: This angle measures the inclination of the cranial base (SN plane) in relation to the mandibular plane. It indirectly provides information about the anteroposterior relation of the jaws, as it compares the position of the maxilla and mandible.\\n\\nD. Facial angle: This angle measures the inclination of the facial profile. It does not directly measure the anteroposterior relation of the jaws.\\n\\nBased on the explanations above, the correct answer is C. Angle between SN & mandibular plane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
