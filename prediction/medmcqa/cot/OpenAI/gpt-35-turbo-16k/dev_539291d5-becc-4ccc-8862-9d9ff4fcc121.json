    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which factor is responsible for the extensive cross-linking of blood clot, we need to understand the process of clot formation. Initially, when there is an injury, platelets aggregate at the site and release various factors. One of these factors is thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin. Fibrin forms a mesh-like structure that helps in clot formation. However, this initial fibrin mesh is not stable and requires further cross-linking to strengthen the clot. The factor responsible for this extensive cross-linking is Factor XIII, also known as fibrin-stabilizing factor. Factor XIII forms covalent bonds between fibrin molecules, making the clot more stable. Plasmin is responsible for clot breakdown, not cross-linking. HMWK (high molecular weight kininogen) is involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, but it does not play a role in cross-linking the clot.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Factor XIII\"}"
