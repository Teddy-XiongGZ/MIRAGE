    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If a drug binds to a receptor and activates it, it is considered an agonist. If a drug binds to a receptor and prevents activation, it is considered an antagonist. If a drug binds to a receptor and activates it in the opposite direction, it is considered an inverse agonist. If a drug binds to a receptor and activates it, but with less efficacy than a full agonist, it is considered a partial agonist. In this case, the drug is binding to activate the receptor, so the correct answer is C. Agonist.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
