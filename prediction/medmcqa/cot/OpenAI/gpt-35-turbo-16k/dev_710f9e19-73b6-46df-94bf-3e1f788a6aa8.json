    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingival deformities refer to abnormalities or changes in the appearance or structure of the gums. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. ANUG (Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis): ANUG is a severe form of gum disease that can cause painful, ulcerated gums, but it does not typically cause deformities in the gums.\\n\\nB. Internal resorption: Internal resorption refers to the destruction of the internal structure of a tooth, not the gums.\\n\\nC. Cementomas: Cementomas, also known as cementoblastomas, are benign tumors that arise from the cells responsible for forming the cementum of the tooth. While they can cause localized swelling or expansion of the jawbone, they do not directly cause gingival deformities.\\n\\nD. Periapical cysts: Periapical cysts are cystic lesions that form at the tip of the tooth root due to chronic inflammation or infection. They do not typically cause gingival deformities.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, none of the options listed are directly associated with gingival deformities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
