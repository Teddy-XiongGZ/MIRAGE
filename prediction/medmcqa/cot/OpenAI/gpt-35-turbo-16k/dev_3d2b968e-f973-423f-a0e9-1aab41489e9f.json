    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lingual ridge refers to the prominent ridge on the lingual (tongue) side of a tooth. To determine which tooth has the most prominent lingual ridge, we need to consider the anatomy of each tooth. The lingual ridge is typically more pronounced in the posterior teeth compared to the anterior teeth. The upper canines and lower canines are anterior teeth and usually do not have a prominent lingual ridge. The upper central incisor and lower central incisor are both anterior teeth, but the lingual ridge is more prominent in the lower central incisor compared to the upper central incisor. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Lower central incisor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
