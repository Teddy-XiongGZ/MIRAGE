    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options is a secondary colonizer, we need to understand the concept of primary and secondary colonizers. Primary colonizers are the first bacteria to colonize a surface, while secondary colonizers are bacteria that colonize the surface after the primary colonizers have established. A. S. sanguis: Streptococcus sanguis is a primary colonizer in the oral cavity, so it is not a secondary colonizer. B. P. intermedia: Prevotella intermedia is a secondary colonizer in the oral cavity, so it is a potential answer. C. Fusobacteria: Fusobacteria are secondary colonizers in the oral cavity, so they are not the correct answer. D. P. gingivalis: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a secondary colonizer in the oral cavity, so it is not the correct answer. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. P. intermedia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
