    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Klenow fragment is a truncated form of DNA polymerase I. It is formed by removing the N-terminal 5'- 3' exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase I. The 5'- 3' exonuclease activity is responsible for proofreading and removing incorrect nucleotides during DNA synthesis. Therefore, the loss of the 5'- 3' exonuclease activity results in the formation of Klenow fragment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 5'- 3' exonuclease\"}"
