    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question states that the roots of primary and secondary teeth are different. The first difference mentioned is that primary roots are more divergent and flaring. We need to determine the other difference between the roots of primary and secondary teeth. Option A states that primary roots show less accessory and lateral canals. This means that primary teeth have fewer additional canals branching off from the main root canal. Option B states that primary roots resorb more easily. Resorption refers to the process of the roots being broken down and absorbed by the body. Option C states that primary roots are shorter. Considering the information provided, the correct answer is option A. The statement that primary roots show less accessory and lateral canals is a valid difference between the roots of primary and secondary teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
