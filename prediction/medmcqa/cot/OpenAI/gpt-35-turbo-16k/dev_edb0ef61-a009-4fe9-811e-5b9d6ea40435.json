    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The chances of ankyloses of a mandibular molar that is autotransplanted can depend on several factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Splinting of mandibular molar: Splinting is a technique used to stabilize teeth after transplantation. While it can help with initial stability, it is not directly related to the chances of ankyloses.\\n\\nB. Surgical extraction of molar: Surgical extraction is the process of removing a tooth from its socket. This is not directly related to the chances of ankyloses after autotransplantation.\\n\\nC. Socket preparation of molar for autotransplantation: Socket preparation involves cleaning and shaping the socket before placing the transplanted tooth. While it can contribute to the success of the procedure, it is not specifically related to ankyloses.\\n\\nD. Root kept moist in cotton: Keeping the root moist during the transplantation process is important for maintaining the viability of the tooth. However, it is not directly related to the chances of ankyloses.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the most relevant factor that can affect the chances of ankyloses of a mandibular molar that is autotransplanted is the socket preparation of the molar for autotransplantation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
