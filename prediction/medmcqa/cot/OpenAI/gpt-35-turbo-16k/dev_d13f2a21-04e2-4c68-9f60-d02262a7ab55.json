    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) and is responsible for providing sensory innervation to the lower teeth, gums, and lip, as well as motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. The mandibular nerve has two main divisions: the anterior division and the posterior division. The anterior division primarily carries sensory fibers, while the posterior division primarily carries motor fibers. Therefore, the anterior division of the mandibular nerve has primarily sensory branches and some motor branches.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
