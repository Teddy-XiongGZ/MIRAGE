    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums caused by plaque buildup. It is the earliest stage of gum disease and if left untreated, it can progress to periodontitis.

While gingivitis is common in adolescents, the prevalence can vary widely. Option C states that gingivitis is characterized by true pocketing, which is not true. True pocketing is a characteristic of periodontitis, not gingivitis. Option D states that gingivitis is a reversible lesion, which is correct. With proper oral hygiene and professional dental care, gingivitis can be reversed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
