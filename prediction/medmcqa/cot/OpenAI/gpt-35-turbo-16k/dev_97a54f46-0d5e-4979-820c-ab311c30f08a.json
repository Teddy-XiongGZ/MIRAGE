    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During exercise in physiological limits, the heart pumps more blood to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients by the muscles. This increased demand is met by an increase in stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each beat. End systolic volume (ESV) is the amount of blood remaining in the ventricles at the end of systole, or contraction of the heart. During exercise, the heart contracts more forcefully and efficiently, leading to a more complete ejection of blood from the ventricles. This results in a decrease in ESV. Therefore, the correct answer is A. ESV decreases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
