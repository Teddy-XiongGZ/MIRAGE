    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S. This abnormal hemoglobin is caused by a point mutation in the gene that codes for the beta chain of hemoglobin. The point mutation results in a single nucleotide change, where adenine is replaced by thymine. This change leads to the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the beta chain of hemoglobin, causing the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Point mutation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
