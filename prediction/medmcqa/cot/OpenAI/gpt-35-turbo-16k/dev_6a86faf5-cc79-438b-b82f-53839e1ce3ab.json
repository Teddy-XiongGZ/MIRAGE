    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The role of barrier membrane in Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) is to prevent epithelial migration. GTR is a technique used in periodontal surgery to regenerate lost periodontal tissues. The barrier membrane is placed between the gingival tissue and the underlying bone and is used to prevent the migration of epithelial cells into the defect site. This allows for the regeneration of periodontal ligament and bone without interference from the gingival tissue. The barrier membrane does not directly help overall healing, stop bleeding, or prevent infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
