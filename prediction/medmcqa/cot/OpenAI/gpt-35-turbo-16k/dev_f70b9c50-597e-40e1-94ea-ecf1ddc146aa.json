    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bacterial meningitis is a serious infection that can be transmitted to others. To prevent further transmission, it is important to isolate the child for a certain period of time. Let's evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. Till 24 hours after starting antibiotics: While starting antibiotics is crucial in treating bacterial meningitis, it may not be sufficient to prevent transmission. \\n\\nB. Till cultures become negative: This option seems reasonable as it ensures that the child is no longer carrying the bacteria that can be transmitted to others. \\n\\nC. Till antibiotics course is complete: While completing the antibiotics course is important for the child's recovery, it may not be necessary to isolate the child for the entire duration of the course to prevent transmission. \\n\\nD. Till 12 hours after admission: This option does not take into account the resolution of the infection or the effectiveness of treatment. \\n\\nBased on the above evaluation, the most appropriate answer would be B. Till cultures become negative.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
