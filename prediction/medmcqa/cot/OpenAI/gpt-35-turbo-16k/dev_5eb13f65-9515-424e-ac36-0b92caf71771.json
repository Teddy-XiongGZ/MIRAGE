    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the appropriate treatment for SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) present on the lateral margin of the tongue staging T2N0, we need to consider the extent of lymph node involvement. The N0 staging indicates no regional lymph node involvement. The treatment options for SCC on the lateral margin of the tongue typically involve surgical intervention to remove the primary tumor and any involved lymph nodes. A. SOHND (supraomohyoid neck dissections) is a surgical procedure that involves removing the lymph nodes in levels I-III of the neck. This option may be appropriate if there is evidence of lymph node involvement. B. Removing lymph nodes I-II along with the primary tumor would involve removing the lymph nodes in levels I and II of the neck. This option may be appropriate if there is no evidence of lymph node involvement beyond level II. C. Removing lymph nodes I-V along with the primary tumor would involve removing the lymph nodes in levels I-V of the neck. This option may be appropriate if there is evidence of lymph node involvement beyond level II. D. Removing lymph nodes I-IV along with the primary tumor would involve removing the lymph nodes in levels I-IV of the neck. This option may be appropriate if there is evidence of lymph node involvement beyond level II and up to level IV. Based on the information provided, since the staging is T2N0 (no regional lymph node involvement), the most appropriate treatment option would be B. Remove Lymph node I-II along with the primary tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
