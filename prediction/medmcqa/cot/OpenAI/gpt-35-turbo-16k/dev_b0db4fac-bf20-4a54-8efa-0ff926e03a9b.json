    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polyglycolic acid suture material is commonly known as Vicryl or Dexon. To determine the type of suture material, we need to consider whether it is absorbable or non-absorbable and whether it is natural or synthetic. Polyglycolic acid is a synthetic material, so we can eliminate choices A and C. Now, we need to determine if it is absorbable or non-absorbable. Vicryl and Dexon are both absorbable sutures, which means they are designed to break down and be absorbed by the body over time. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Absorbable synthetic suture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
