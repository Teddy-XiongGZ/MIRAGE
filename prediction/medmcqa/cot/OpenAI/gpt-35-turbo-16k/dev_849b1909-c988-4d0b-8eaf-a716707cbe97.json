    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that originate from the spinal cord in the neck and supply the upper limb. It is divided into five main parts: roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and branches. The roots are the initial segments of the brachial plexus that arise from the spinal cord. The trunks are formed by the union of the roots. The divisions are formed by the splitting of the trunks. The cords are formed by the merging of the divisions. Finally, the branches are the individual nerves that arise from the cords and supply specific muscles and areas of the upper limb. Based on this information, the part of the brachial plexus that does not give branches is the root.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
