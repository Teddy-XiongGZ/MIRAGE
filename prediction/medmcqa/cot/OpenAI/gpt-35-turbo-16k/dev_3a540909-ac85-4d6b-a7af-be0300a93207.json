    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non paralytic polio refers to a form of polio infection where there is no paralysis. To determine the features of non paralytic polio, we need to consider the symptoms commonly associated with this condition. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Absent deep tendon reflexes: This can be a feature of non paralytic polio as it affects the nervous system. \\nB. Head drop: Head drop is not typically associated with non paralytic polio. It is more commonly seen in cases of paralytic polio where there is muscle weakness or paralysis.\\nC. Nuchal rigidity: Nuchal rigidity, or stiffness in the neck, can be a symptom of non paralytic polio as it can affect the muscles and nerves in the neck.\\nD. Knee heel test negative: The knee heel test is used to assess the function of the lower limbs. In non paralytic polio, the test is typically positive, indicating muscle weakness or paralysis. Therefore, a negative knee heel test would not be a feature of non paralytic polio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
