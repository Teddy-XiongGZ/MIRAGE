    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"For >10 mm setback of mandible, the most suitable surgery would be a procedure that allows for significant movement of the mandible. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Sagittal split ramus osteotomy: This procedure involves cutting the mandible and repositioning the posterior part of the jaw. It can provide a setback of up to 10 mm, but may not be sufficient for >10 mm setback.\\n\\nB. Vertical ramus osteotomy: This procedure involves cutting the mandible vertically and repositioning the entire jaw. It can provide a greater setback than sagittal split ramus osteotomy and may be suitable for >10 mm setback.\\n\\nC. Subapical osteotomy: This procedure involves cutting the mandible below the teeth and repositioning the front part of the jaw. It is typically used for smaller setbacks and may not be suitable for >10 mm setback.\\n\\nD. Body osteotomy with extraction of premolars: This procedure involves cutting the mandible in the body region and extracting premolars to create space for repositioning. It can provide a significant setback and may be suitable for >10 mm setback.\\n\\nBased on the above evaluation, the most suitable surgery for >10 mm setback of mandible would be either B. Vertical ramus osteotomy or D. Body osteotomy with extraction of premolars.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
