    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When force is applied perpendicular to a surface, it causes deformation in the material. The type of strain that develops in this situation is called shear strain. Shear strain occurs when adjacent layers of a material slide past each other in opposite directions. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Shear stress.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
