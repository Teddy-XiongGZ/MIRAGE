    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the question is asking about the type of consent that involves explaining all the necessary information about the diagnosis, nature of treatment, risks involved, prospects of success, and alternative methods of treatment known. This type of consent ensures that the patient has a clear understanding of the situation and can make an informed decision. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Implied consent: Implied consent is when a patient's actions or behavior indicate their agreement to a procedure or treatment without explicitly giving verbal or written consent. It does not necessarily involve explaining all the necessary information.\\n\\nB. Express consent: Express consent is when a patient explicitly gives their consent, either verbally or in writing, for a specific procedure or treatment. While it involves the patient's agreement, it does not necessarily guarantee that all the necessary information has been explained.\\n\\nC. Informed consent: Informed consent is the type of consent that involves explaining all the necessary information about the diagnosis, nature of treatment, risks involved, prospects of success, and alternative methods of treatment known. It ensures that the patient has a clear understanding of the situation and can make an informed decision. This option aligns with the requirements mentioned in the question.\\n\\nD. Substitute consent: Substitute consent is when someone other than the patient, such as a legal guardian or healthcare proxy, gives consent on behalf of the patient who is unable to make decisions. It does not necessarily involve explaining all the necessary information.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C. Informed consent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
