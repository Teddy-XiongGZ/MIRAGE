    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cyanosis in a newborn with oligaemic lung fields and a normal sized heart suggests a congenital heart defect that causes decreased pulmonary blood flow. Among the given options, the most likely diagnosis is Pulmonary atresia. Pulmonary atresia is a condition where there is complete obstruction of the pulmonary valve, leading to absent or severely reduced blood flow to the lungs. This results in oligaemic lung fields on X-ray. The other options (Ebstein's anomaly, Transposition of great arteries, and Tetralogy of Fallot) typically present with different radiographic findings and are less likely in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Pulmonary atresia\"}"
