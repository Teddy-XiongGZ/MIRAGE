It is characterized by the child's focus on their genitals and their developing sense of gender identity. On the other hand, Piaget's stages of cognitive development do not directly correspond to Freud's psychosexual stages. Piaget's stages focus on the development of cognitive abilities. The sensorimotor stage is the first stage, which occurs from birth to around 2 years old and is characterized by the child's exploration of the world through their senses and motor actions. The preoperational stage is the second stage, which occurs from around 2 to 7 years old and is characterized by the child's development of symbolic thinking and language skills. The concrete operational stage is the third stage, which occurs from around 7 to 11 years old and is characterized by the child's ability to think logically about concrete objects and events.
