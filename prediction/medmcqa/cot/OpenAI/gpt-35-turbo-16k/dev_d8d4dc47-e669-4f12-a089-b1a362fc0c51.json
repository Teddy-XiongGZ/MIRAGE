    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In resorption of roots of the primary teeth, the dental pulp undergoes changes. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Plays a passive role: This option suggests that the dental pulp does not actively participate in the resorption process. \\nB. Becomes a fibrotic non-vital mass: This option implies that the dental pulp becomes fibrotic and non-vital, which is not consistent with the resorption process. \\nC. Initiates resorption from the inner surface of roots: This option suggests that the dental pulp initiates the resorption process from the inner surface of the roots. \\nD. Aids in formation of secondary dentin slowing down resorption: This option implies that the dental pulp aids in the formation of secondary dentin, which slows down the resorption process. \\n\\nBased on the information provided, option C seems to be the most accurate as the dental pulp is known to initiate resorption from the inner surface of roots.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
