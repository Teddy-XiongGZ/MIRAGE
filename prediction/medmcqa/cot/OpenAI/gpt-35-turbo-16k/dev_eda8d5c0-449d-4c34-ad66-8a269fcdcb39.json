    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biotin is a coenzyme that plays a crucial role in carboxylation reactions. Carboxylases are enzymes that catalyze the addition of a carboxyl group to a substrate. Therefore, the activity of carboxylases is directly affected by biotin deficiency. Among the given options, the enzyme that is a carboxylase is option D. Hence, the activity of the enzyme affected by biotin deficiency is a carboxylase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
