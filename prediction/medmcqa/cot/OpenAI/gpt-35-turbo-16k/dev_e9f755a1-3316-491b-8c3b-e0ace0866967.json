    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The complaint of sensitivity to chewing pressure after 3 weeks of insertion of a distal extension partial denture suggests a possible problem with the denture. Let's consider each option:\\n\\nA. Improper occlusion: Improper occlusion can cause discomfort and pain, but it is less likely to cause sensitivity to chewing pressure specifically.\\n\\nB. Abrasion of tooth by clasp: This can cause localized sensitivity, but it is less likely to cause sensitivity to chewing pressure in general.\\n\\nC. Wearing off the cement base: If the cement base has worn off, it can lead to movement of the denture, which can cause sensitivity to chewing pressure.\\n\\nD. Passive retentive arm: A passive retentive arm is designed to provide stability and retention to the denture. It is less likely to cause sensitivity to chewing pressure.\\n\\nConsidering the symptoms and possibilities, the most probable reason for the patient's complaint would be C. Wearing off the cement base.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
