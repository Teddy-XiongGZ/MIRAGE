    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the firing process in ceramics, shrinkage occurs due to the removal of water and organic materials, as well as the rearrangement of particles. The maximum shrinkage typically occurs during the fusion stage, which is the final stage of firing where the ceramic material reaches its maximum temperature and undergoes vitrification. At this stage, the particles in the ceramic material are densely packed and the water and organic materials have been completely removed, leading to the highest degree of shrinkage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
