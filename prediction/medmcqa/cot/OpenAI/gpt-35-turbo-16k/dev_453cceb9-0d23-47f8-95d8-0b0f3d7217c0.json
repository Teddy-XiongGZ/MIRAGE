    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The palatine process refers to the formation of the hard palate, which is the bony structure that separates the oral and nasal cavities. The fusion of the palatine process occurs during embryonic development. The fusion process starts with the medial edges of the palatine shelves coming together and fusing in the midline. This fusion begins at a specific time during development. At around 6 weeks post fertilization, the palatine shelves start to elevate from the maxillary prominences on either side of the developing face. By 8 weeks post fertilization, the palatine shelves have elevated further and are approaching the midline. At this stage, the fusion process begins, and the medial edges of the palatine shelves start to fuse together. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 8 weeks post fertilisation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
