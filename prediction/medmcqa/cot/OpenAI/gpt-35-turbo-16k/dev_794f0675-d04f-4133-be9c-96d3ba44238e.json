    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In patients with acute abscess, antibiotic therapy is typically indicated to prevent the spread of infection and to treat systemic symptoms. Let's evaluate each option to determine if it is an indication for antibiotic therapy: A. Fever: Fever is a common symptom of infection, including abscesses. It is often an indication for antibiotic therapy. B. Deep inaccessible pocket: A deep inaccessible pocket may require surgical drainage, but it is not necessarily an indication for antibiotic therapy. C. Horizontal bone loss: Horizontal bone loss is a sign of periodontal disease and may not directly indicate the need for antibiotic therapy in an acute abscess. D. Regional lymphadenopathy: Regional lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes, can be a sign of infection and may indicate the need for antibiotic therapy in an acute abscess. Based on this evaluation, option C, horizontal bone loss, is not an indication for antibiotic therapy in patients with acute abscess.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
