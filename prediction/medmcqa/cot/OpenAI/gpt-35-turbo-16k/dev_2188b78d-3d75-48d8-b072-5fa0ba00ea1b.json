    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a tooth is avulsed (knocked out), it is important to preserve the tooth and keep it moist to increase the chances of successful re-implantation. Here are the steps to consider: 1. The tooth should be handled carefully, avoiding touching the root surface. 2. It should be rinsed gently with saline or water to remove any debris. 3. The tooth should be kept moist during transportation to the dentist. 4. The best medium for transporting an avulsed tooth is a suitable storage medium, such as milk or a special tooth preservation solution. 5. Cold milk is a commonly recommended medium for transporting an avulsed tooth as it helps to maintain the vitality of the tooth and prevent it from drying out. 6. Normal saline can also be used as an alternative if milk is not available. 7. Wrapping the tooth in a wet handkerchief may not provide sufficient moisture and may not be the ideal method for transporting an avulsed tooth. 8. The buccal vestibule refers to the space between the cheek and the teeth, and it is not a suitable medium for transporting an avulsed tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
