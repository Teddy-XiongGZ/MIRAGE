    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a tooth is traumatized, a radiographic examination is essential for several reasons. First, it helps establish baseline data by providing a clear image of the tooth's current condition. This baseline data can be used for future comparisons to monitor any changes or progression of the trauma. Second, a radiographic examination can help identify any associated root fractures that may have occurred due to the trauma. Root fractures can be difficult to detect clinically, so radiographs are necessary for accurate diagnosis. Lastly, a radiographic examination can also help determine the stage of root development. This is important because the stage of root development can influence the treatment approach and prognosis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
