    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A keyhole-shaped visual field defect is typically seen in lesions involving the optic chiasma. The optic chiasma is the site where the optic nerves from each eye cross over. Lesions in this region can result in compression or damage to the crossing fibers, leading to a specific pattern of visual field loss. Lesions involving the optic disk, lateral geniculate body, or occipital lobe would not typically produce a keyhole-shaped visual field defect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
