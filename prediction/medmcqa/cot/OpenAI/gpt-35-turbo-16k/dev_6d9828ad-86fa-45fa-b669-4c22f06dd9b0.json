    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lingual extension of a lower denture refers to how far the denture extends towards the tongue. To determine what limits the lingual extension, we need to consider the anatomy of the oral cavity. The modiolus is a group of muscles at the corner of the mouth and is not directly related to the lingual extension of a lower denture. The mylohyoid muscle is a muscle that forms the floor of the mouth and can limit the lingual extension. The origin of the genioglossus muscle is located on the inner surface of the mandible and can also limit the lingual extension. The sublingual salivary glands are located under the tongue and can also limit the lingual extension. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Modiolus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
