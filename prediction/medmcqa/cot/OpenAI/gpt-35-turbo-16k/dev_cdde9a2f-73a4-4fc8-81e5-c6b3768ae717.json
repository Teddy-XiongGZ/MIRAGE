    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first radiographic sign of chronic pulpal infection of primary molars is usually periapical bony changes. This is because chronic infection of the pulp can lead to inflammation and destruction of the surrounding bone, resulting in changes seen on radiographs. Root resorption and widening of the apical periodontal ligament may occur later in the disease process, but they are not typically the first signs. Changes in the bony furcation area may be seen in cases of advanced periodontal disease, but they are not specific to chronic pulpal infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
