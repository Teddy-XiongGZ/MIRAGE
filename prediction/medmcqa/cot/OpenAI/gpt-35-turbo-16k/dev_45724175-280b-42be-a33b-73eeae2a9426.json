    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation in endodontic treatment is an important step to ensure the success of the procedure. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. CDJ (Cemento-Enamel Junction): The CDJ is the junction between the enamel of the tooth crown and the cementum of the tooth root. It is not a histological landmark related to the termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation.\\n\\nB. Apical foramen: The apical foramen is the opening at the tip of the tooth root through which the nerves and blood vessels enter the pulp. It is not a histological landmark for the termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation.\\n\\nC. Apical constriction: The apical constriction is the narrowest part of the root canal near the apex of the tooth. It is considered the histological landmark for the termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation. The goal is to reach this point during the procedure.\\n\\nD. All of the above: Since options A and B are not histological landmarks for the termination of cleaning, shaping, and obturation, the correct answer is C. Apical constriction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
