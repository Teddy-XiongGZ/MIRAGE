    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that play a role in the immune response. An increased monocytic count can be seen in various conditions. To determine which condition is associated with an increased monocytic count, we need to consider the characteristics of each option. \\n\\nA. Parasitic infections: While parasitic infections can cause an increase in certain types of white blood cells, such as eosinophils, they are not typically associated with an increased monocytic count. \\n\\nB. Sub-Acute Bacterial Endocarditis: Bacterial infections can cause an increase in monocytes as part of the immune response. Therefore, this option is a possibility. \\n\\nC. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system and are not typically associated with an increased monocytic count. \\n\\nD. None of the above: This option suggests that none of the conditions listed are associated with an increased monocytic count. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is B. Sub-Acute Bacterial Endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
