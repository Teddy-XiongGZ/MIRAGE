    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intermediate filaments are a type of cytoskeletal protein that provide structural support to cells. They are composed of various types of monomeric subunits. To determine which of the options is not a monomeric intermediate filament, we need to identify which one does not belong to this category. \\n\\nA. Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament protein found in mesenchymal cells.\\nB. Keratin is a type I and type II intermediate filament protein found in epithelial cells.\\nC. Desmin is a type III intermediate filament protein found in muscle cells.\\nD. Tubulin is not an intermediate filament protein, but rather a component of microtubules, which are another type of cytoskeletal protein. \\n\\nBased on this information, the answer is D. Tubulin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
