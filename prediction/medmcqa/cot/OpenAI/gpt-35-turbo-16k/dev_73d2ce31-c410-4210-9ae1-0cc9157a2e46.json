    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio, we need to determine the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) from the spirometry curve. FEV1 is the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration, and FVC is the total volume of air exhaled during a forced expiration. To calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio, we divide the FEV1 by the FVC and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage. Looking at the spirometry curve, we can see that the FEV1 is approximately 3 liters and the FVC is approximately 4 liters. Therefore, the FEV1/FVC ratio is (3/4) * 100 = 75%. Based on this calculation, the answer choice is B. 70-79%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 70-79%\"}"
