    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To measure cardiac afterload, we need to assess the resistance that the heart has to overcome to pump blood out of the left ventricle. Afterload is determined by the pressure against which the heart must pump. Mean arterial pressure (A) is a measure of the average pressure in the arteries during one cardiac cycle and does not directly reflect the resistance that the heart faces. LV end diastolic pressure (B) is the pressure in the left ventricle at the end of diastole and is not a direct measure of afterload. LV mean systolic pressure (C) is the average pressure in the left ventricle during systole and does not directly reflect the resistance that the heart faces. Total peripheral resistance (D) is the resistance that the heart must overcome to pump blood out of the left ventricle and is the best index to measure cardiac afterload. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
