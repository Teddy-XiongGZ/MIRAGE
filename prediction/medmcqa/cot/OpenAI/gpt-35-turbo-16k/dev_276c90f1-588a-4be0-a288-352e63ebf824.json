    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine at which stage of Nolla's the tooth starts erupting, we need to understand the stages of tooth development according to Nolla's classification. Nolla's classification divides tooth development into 10 stages, numbered from 1 to 10. The stages represent the mineralization of the tooth. Tooth eruption occurs after mineralization is complete. According to Nolla's classification, stage 1 represents the initiation of mineralization, and stage 10 represents complete mineralization. Therefore, the tooth starts erupting after stage 10. Looking at the given choices, we can see that none of the options represent a stage after stage 10. Therefore, none of the provided choices are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
