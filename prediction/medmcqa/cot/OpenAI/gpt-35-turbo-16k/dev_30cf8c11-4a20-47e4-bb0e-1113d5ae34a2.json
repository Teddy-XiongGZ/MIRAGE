    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lidocaine is commonly used in dentistry because it has specific properties that make it suitable for dental procedures. Let's evaluate each option to determine the correct answer. \\n\\nA. Causes Less depression of CNS: Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that primarily acts on the nerves in the area it is applied. It does not have a significant effect on the central nervous system (CNS), so this option is not the main reason why lidocaine is commonly used in dentistry. \\n\\nB. Causes less cardiovascular collapse: Lidocaine has a lower risk of causing cardiovascular collapse compared to other local anesthetics. However, this is not the main reason why lidocaine is commonly used in dentistry. \\n\\nC. Causes lesser incidence of allergic reactions: Lidocaine has a low incidence of allergic reactions, making it a safer choice for dental procedures. This is one of the main reasons why lidocaine is commonly used in dentistry. \\n\\nD. Is 50 times more potent than procaine: Lidocaine is indeed more potent than procaine, but the potency alone is not the main reason why lidocaine is commonly used in dentistry. \\n\\nConsidering the above explanations, the correct answer is C. Causes lesser incidence of allergic reactions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
