    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) supplies blood to the anterior inferior cerebellum. Damage to this artery can lead to infarction, which means a lack of blood supply to the affected area. To determine the potential damage caused by infarction of the AICA, we need to consider the structures that receive blood supply from this artery. The AICA supplies blood to the lateral part of the pons, including the facial colliculus, cochlear nucleus, and vestibular nuclei. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. Vestibular nuclei.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
