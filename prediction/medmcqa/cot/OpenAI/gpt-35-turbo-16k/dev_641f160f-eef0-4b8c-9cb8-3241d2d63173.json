    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a child with active liver failure, there are several factors that can contribute to a poor prognosis. To determine the most important prognosis factor for death, we need to consider the potential complications and consequences of liver failure. Option A: Increasing transaminases - While elevated transaminases (such as AST and ALT) are indicative of liver damage, they alone may not be the most important factor for death in liver failure. Option B: Increasing bilirubin - Elevated bilirubin levels are commonly seen in liver failure and can indicate impaired liver function. However, it is not the most important factor for death in liver failure. Option C: Increasing prothrombin time - Prothrombin time measures the ability of blood to clot and is often prolonged in liver failure due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors. While it is an important factor to consider, it may not be the most important prognosis factor for death. Option D: Gram (\u2013)ve sepsis - Sepsis, particularly caused by gram-negative bacteria, can be a severe complication in liver failure. It can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and ultimately death. Considering the potential severity of sepsis in liver failure, it is likely the most important prognosis factor for death. Based on the above analysis, the most important prognosis factor for death in a child with active liver failure is likely option D: Gram (\u2013)ve sepsis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
