    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In duplex Doppler, the venous blood flow of the lower limb can be characterized by the waveform pattern. The waveform pattern is determined by the direction and velocity of blood flow. Step 1: Venous blood flow in the lower limb is normally characterized by a phasic pattern, meaning that it has distinct phases or components. Step 2: Monophasic waveform refers to a single component or phase in the waveform. This is not characteristic of venous blood flow in the lower limb. Step 3: Biphasic waveform refers to two components or phases in the waveform. This is a possible characteristic of venous blood flow in the lower limb, but it is not the most common pattern. Step 4: Triphasic waveform refers to three components or phases in the waveform. This is not characteristic of venous blood flow in the lower limb. Step 5: Non-phasic waveform refers to a lack of distinct phases or components in the waveform. This is not characteristic of venous blood flow in the lower limb. Based on the above reasoning, the characteristic of venous blood flow of the lower limb in duplex Doppler is most commonly Biphasic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
