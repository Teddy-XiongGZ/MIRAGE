    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Central cyanosis and a short systolic murmur in a neonate on the 2nd day of birth suggests a congenital heart defect. Tetralogy of Fallot's, Transposition of great vessels, Atrial septal defect, and Ventricular Septal defect are all possible diagnoses for a neonate with these symptoms. To differentiate between these options, further evaluation is needed. Tetralogy of Fallot's typically presents with a harsh systolic murmur and a boot-shaped heart on chest X-ray. Transposition of great vessels presents with cyanosis that is not relieved by oxygen administration and a single loud second heart sound. Atrial septal defect presents with a fixed split second heart sound and a wide and fixed splitting of the second heart sound. Ventricular Septal defect presents with a harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Given the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Transposition of great vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
