    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lead poisoning inhibits some enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway. One of the enzymes affected is ferrochelatase, which is responsible for the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin IX to form heme. Inhibition of ferrochelatase leads to the accumulation of protoporphyrin IX in the blood. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Ferrochelatase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
