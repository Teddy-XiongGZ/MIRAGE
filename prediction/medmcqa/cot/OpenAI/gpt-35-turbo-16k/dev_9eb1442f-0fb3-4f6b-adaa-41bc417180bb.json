    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the sample size for a study, we need to consider the prevalence of the disease, the desired alpha error, the relative precision, and the power. Step 1: Calculate the Z-score for the desired alpha error. Since the alpha error is 5%, we need to find the Z-score corresponding to a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05. The Z-score for a 5% significance level is approximately 1.645. Step 2: Calculate the Z-score for the desired power. Since the power is 20%, we need to find the Z-score corresponding to a one-tailed test with a power of 0.2. The Z-score for a power of 20% is approximately -0.842. Step 3: Calculate the standard deviation (SD) of the prevalence. The relative precision is 20%, which means the SD is 0.2 times the prevalence. In this case, the SD is 0.2 times 10%, which is 0.02. Step 4: Calculate the sample size using the formula: n = (Z1-alpha/2 + Z1-beta)^2 * (p * (1-p)) / (d^2) where n is the sample size, Z1-alpha/2 is the Z-score for the desired alpha error, Z1-beta is the Z-score for the desired power, p is the prevalence, and d is the relative precision. Plugging in the values: n = (1.645 + (-0.842))^2 * (0.1 * (1-0.1)) / (0.02^2) n = 2.487^2 * 0.09 / 0.0004 n = 6.186 * 0.09 / 0.0004 n = 0.55674 / 0.0004 n = 1391.85 Step 5: Round up the sample size to the nearest whole number since we cannot have a fraction of a participant. Therefore, the accurate sample size for this study is 1392. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 900.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
