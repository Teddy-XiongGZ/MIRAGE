    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The principle secretory cells found in the single layer outlining the pulp are responsible for producing dentin, which is the hard tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth. Fibroblasts are connective tissue cells that produce collagen and are not involved in dentin production. Ameloblasts are responsible for producing enamel, the outermost layer of the tooth, and are not found in the pulp. Undifferentiated cells are immature cells that have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, but they are not specifically involved in dentin production. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Odontoblast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
