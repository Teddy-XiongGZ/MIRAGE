    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bacteriocin is a protein produced by bacteria that has antimicrobial activity against other bacteria. It is not involved in the adherence of plaque to the tooth surface, so option A is true. Bacteriocin can be used in therapy of dental caries as it can selectively kill cariogenic bacteria, so option B is true. Bacteriocin itself is a protein, so option C is true. However, bacteriocin does not enhance the growth of other bacteria, but rather inhibits their growth, so option D is false.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
