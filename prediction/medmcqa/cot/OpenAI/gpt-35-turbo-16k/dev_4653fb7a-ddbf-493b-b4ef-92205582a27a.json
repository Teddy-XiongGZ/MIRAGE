    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tooth does not have 5 cusps, we need to know the number of cusps for each tooth. The mandibular 2nd molar typically has 5 cusps, so it is not the answer. The mandibular 1st molar usually has 5 cusps as well. The mandibular 3rd molar, also known as the wisdom tooth, usually has 4 cusps. The maxillary 1st molar typically has 5 cusps. Therefore, the tooth that does not have 5 cusps is the Mandibular 3rd Molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
