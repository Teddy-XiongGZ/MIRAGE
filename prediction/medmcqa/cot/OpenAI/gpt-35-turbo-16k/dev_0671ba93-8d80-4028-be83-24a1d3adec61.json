    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The upper lip is formed during embryonic development. To determine which structures fuse to form the upper lip, we need to understand the development of the face. The face develops from five facial prominences: two maxillary processes, two mandibular processes, and one frontonasal process. The upper lip is primarily formed by the fusion of the maxillary processes with the medial nasal processes. The lateral nasal processes contribute to the formation of the sides of the nose, but they do not directly fuse to form the upper lip. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Maxillary and lateral nasal process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
