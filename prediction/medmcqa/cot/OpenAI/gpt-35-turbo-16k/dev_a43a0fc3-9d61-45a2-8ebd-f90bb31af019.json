    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Kiesselbach's plexus is an area in the anterior part of the nasal septum where several arteries converge. The arteries that contribute to Kiesselbach's plexus include the anterior ethmoidal artery, sphenopalatine artery, greater palatine artery, and septal branch of the superior labial artery. To determine which of the options is not a branch of the external carotid artery in Kiesselbach's plexus, we need to identify the origin of each artery. The anterior ethmoidal artery arises from the ophthalmic artery, not the external carotid artery. Therefore, the answer is A. Anterior Ethmoidal artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
