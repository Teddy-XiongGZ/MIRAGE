    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the percentage of cases of mandibular incisors with a single apical foramen, we need to consider the available options. Option A states that 97.80% of cases have a single apical foramen. Option B states that 82.50% of cases have a single apical foramen. Option C states that 60% of cases have a single apical foramen. Option D states that the percentage ranges from 60% to 78%. Based on the options provided, we can see that there is some variation in the percentages given. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the most accurate and reliable source of information. Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact percentage. However, we can make an educated guess based on the options provided. Given that option A has the highest percentage (97.80%), it seems unlikely that such a high percentage of cases would have a single apical foramen. Option B (82.50%) also seems relatively high. Option C (60%) is a more conservative estimate, but it is possible that the actual percentage falls within this range. Option D provides a range of 60% to 78%, which seems reasonable. Considering the available options, the most likely answer is option D, 60% to 78%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
