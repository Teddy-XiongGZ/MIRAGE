    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effect of the mistake on the result, we need to understand the impact on the mean and median. The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. Since the highest sample of 58 was entered as 85, the mean will be affected because the sum of the values will increase. However, the median will not be affected because it is determined by the middle value, which remains the same regardless of the mistake. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Increased mean, decreased median.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
