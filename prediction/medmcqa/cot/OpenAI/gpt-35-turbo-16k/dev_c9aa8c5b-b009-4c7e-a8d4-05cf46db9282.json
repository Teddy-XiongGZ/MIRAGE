    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Biliary duct stricture is a condition characterized by narrowing or obstruction of the bile ducts. Retching and vomiting are common symptoms of this condition. Morphine is a potent opioid analgesic that can be used to manage pain in patients with biliary duct stricture. However, it is important to note that morphine can have side effects. One of the potential side effects of morphine is itching, which is caused by the release of histamine. Another potential side effect is urinary retention, as opioids can cause relaxation of the smooth muscles in the bladder. Increase in vomiting is not a common side effect of morphine. Overstimulation of the respiratory center can occur with high doses of opioids, but it is unlikely to occur with a single dose of 12 mg of morphine. Therefore, the most likely side effect in this case would be urinary retention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
