    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes can be determined by considering the characteristics of each option. \\n\\nA. Passive diffusion: This is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, without the need for energy. It is a common mechanism for small, lipophilic drugs to cross membranes. \\n\\nB. Facilitated diffusion: This is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, but with the assistance of specific carrier proteins. It does not require energy. \\n\\nC. Active transport: This is the movement of molecules against their concentration gradient, from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. It requires energy and specific carrier proteins. \\n\\nD. Endocytosis: This is the process by which cells engulf substances by forming vesicles around them. It is not a direct mechanism of drug transport across membranes. \\n\\nConsidering these options, the major mechanism of transport of drugs across biological membranes is most commonly by passive diffusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
