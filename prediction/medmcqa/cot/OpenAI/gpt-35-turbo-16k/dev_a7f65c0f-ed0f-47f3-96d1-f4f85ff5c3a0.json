    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The amount of energy actually producing cutting can be determined by considering the cutting efficiency. Cutting efficiency refers to the ratio of the energy used to perform the cutting operation to the total energy input. It takes into account factors such as the type of cutting tool, the material being cut, and the cutting process itself. Cutting effectiveness, on the other hand, refers to how well the cutting operation achieves its intended purpose. It is not directly related to the amount of energy used. Cutting fraction is not a commonly used term in this context. Therefore, the answer choice is A. Cutting efficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
