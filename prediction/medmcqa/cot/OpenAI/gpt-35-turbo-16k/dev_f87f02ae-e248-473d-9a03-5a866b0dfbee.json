    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The LDL receptor is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cholesterol levels in the body. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. It recognizes apo B100 and apo E: The LDL receptor is responsible for recognizing and binding to apolipoprotein B100 (apo B100), which is the main protein component of LDL cholesterol. It also recognizes apo E, which is found in both LDL and other lipoproteins.\\n\\nB. Involved in endocytosis process: The LDL receptor is involved in the process of endocytosis, where it binds to LDL particles and internalizes them into the cell.\\n\\nC. Present in both hepatic and extrahepatic cells: The LDL receptor is present in various cells, including hepatocytes (liver cells) and extrahepatic cells such as those in the adrenal glands and ovaries.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is D. All of the above, as all the statements are true about the LDL receptor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
