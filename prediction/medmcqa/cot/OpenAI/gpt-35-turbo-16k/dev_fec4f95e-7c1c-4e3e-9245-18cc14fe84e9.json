    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To increase acetylcholine release from the presynaptic membrane, we need to understand the process of neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic membrane through a process called exocytosis. This process is triggered by the influx of calcium ions (Ca+) into the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, to increase acetylcholine release, we need to enhance the entry of calcium ions into the presynaptic terminal. Looking at the options, blocking voltage gated Ca+ channels on the presynaptic membrane would inhibit the entry of calcium ions and therefore decrease acetylcholine release. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Blocking voltage gated Ca+ channels on the presynaptic membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
