    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ultrashort-acting barbiturates are commonly used for anesthesia induction and maintenance. They have a rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect. Meprobamate is not a barbiturate, so it can be eliminated as an option. Phenobarbitone is a long-acting barbiturate, so it can also be eliminated. This leaves us with two potential options: pentobarbitone and thiopentone. Both pentobarbitone and thiopentone are ultrashort-acting barbiturates commonly used for anesthesia induction. However, thiopentone is the preferred choice due to its faster onset of action and shorter duration of effect compared to pentobarbitone. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Thiopentone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
