    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive release of thyroid hormones. It can occur after thyroid surgery due to various reasons. Let's analyze the potential causes one by one:\\n\\nA. Poor antibiotic coverage: While poor antibiotic coverage can lead to infection, it is not the most likely cause of thyroid storm.\\n\\nB. Rough handling during surgery: Rough handling during surgery can cause release of thyroid hormones, but it is not the most likely cause of thyroid storm.\\n\\nC. Removal of parathyroid: The parathyroid glands are responsible for regulating calcium levels in the body and are not directly related to thyroid hormone release. Therefore, removal of parathyroid is not the most likely cause of thyroid storm.\\n\\nD. Inadequate preoperative preparation: Inadequate preoperative preparation, such as failure to adequately control thyroid hormone levels before surgery, is the most likely cause of thyroid storm after thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
