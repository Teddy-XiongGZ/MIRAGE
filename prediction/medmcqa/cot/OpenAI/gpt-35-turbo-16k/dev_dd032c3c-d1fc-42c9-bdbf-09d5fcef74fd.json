    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein, which is a type of lipoprotein that is responsible for transporting triglycerides from the liver to the peripheral tissues. To determine where VLDL is synthesized, we need to consider the organs involved in lipid metabolism. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is primarily involved in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats, but it does not synthesize lipoproteins. The liver, on the other hand, is the main organ responsible for the synthesis of lipoproteins, including VLDL. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
