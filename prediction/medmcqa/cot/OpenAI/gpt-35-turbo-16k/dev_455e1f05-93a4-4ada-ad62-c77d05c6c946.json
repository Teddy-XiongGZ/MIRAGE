    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The posterior limit of a maxillary denture base refers to the boundary at the back of the denture. To determine this limit, we need to consider the anatomical structures in the posterior region of the maxilla. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Hamular notch: The hamular notch is a depression located on the medial side of the hamular process. It is not on the posterior border of the denture base.\\n\\nB. Hamular process: The hamular process is a bony prominence located posteriorly in the maxilla. It is a part of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. The hamular process is indeed on the posterior border of the denture base.\\n\\nC. Fovea palatine: The fovea palatine is a small depression on the hard palate, but it is not on the posterior border of the denture base.\\n\\nD. Vibrating Line: The vibrating line is a line on the soft palate that separates the movable and immovable tissues. It is not on the posterior border of the denture base.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Hamular process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
