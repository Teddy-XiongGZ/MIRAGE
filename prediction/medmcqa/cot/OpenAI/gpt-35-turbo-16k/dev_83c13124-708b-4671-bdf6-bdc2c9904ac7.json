    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prions are infectious proteins that can cause diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and mad cow disease. Let's go through each option to determine which one is true about prions. \\n\\nA. Readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC: Prions are highly resistant to heat and can survive autoclaving at 121oC. Therefore, this option is not true. \\n\\nB. Evokes strong immunogenic reaction: Prions do not typically evoke a strong immune response, so this option is not true. \\n\\nC. Have short incubation periods: Prion diseases have long incubation periods, often lasting years or even decades. Therefore, this option is not true. \\n\\nD. Contains DNA/RNA: Prions are composed solely of misfolded proteins and do not contain DNA or RNA. Therefore, this option is not true. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is none of the above options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
