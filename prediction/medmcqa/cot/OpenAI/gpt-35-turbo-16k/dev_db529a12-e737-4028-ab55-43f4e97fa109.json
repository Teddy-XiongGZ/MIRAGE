    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lactose intolerance is caused by the deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which is responsible for breaking down lactose (the sugar found in milk and dairy products). Therefore, the agent least likely to cause lactose intolerance would be the one with the lowest lactose content. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Condensed MILK: Condensed milk is made by removing water from regular milk and adding sugar. It still contains lactose, so it can cause lactose intolerance.\\nB. Skimmed Milk: Skimmed milk is regular milk with the fat removed. It still contains lactose, so it can cause lactose intolerance.\\nC. Yogurt: Yogurt is made by fermenting milk with bacteria, which breaks down lactose. The fermentation process reduces the lactose content, making yogurt easier to digest for individuals with lactose intolerance. Therefore, yogurt is less likely to cause lactose intolerance compared to other dairy products.\\nD. Ice cream: Ice cream is made from milk and sugar, both of which contain lactose. Therefore, ice cream can cause lactose intolerance.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the agent least likely to cause lactose intolerance among these options is Yogurt (option C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
