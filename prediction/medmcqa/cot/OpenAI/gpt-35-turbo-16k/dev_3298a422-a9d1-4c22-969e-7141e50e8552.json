The medial pterygoid muscle is responsible for elevating and protruding the mandible, but it does not limit the distolingual extension of the impression. C. The lateral pterygoid muscle is involved in the movement of the mandible, but it does not limit the distolingual extension of the impression. D. The superior constrictor muscle is located in the pharynx and is not directly involved in limiting the distolingual extension of the mandibular impression.
