    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inter-radicular area refers to the space between the roots of teeth. To determine the type of bone present in this area, we need to consider the characteristics of each option. \\n\\nA. Cortical bone is dense and compact, typically found on the outer surface of bones. It provides strength and support. \\nB. Cancellous bone, also known as trabecular or spongy bone, has a porous structure with a network of trabeculae. It is found in the interior of bones and provides flexibility and shock absorption. \\nC. Osteophytic bone refers to the formation of bony outgrowths or spurs, often seen in conditions like osteoarthritis. \\nD. Exophytic bone is not a recognized term in relation to bone types. \\n\\nConsidering the location and function of the inter-radicular area, it is more likely to contain cancellous bone, which allows for some flexibility and shock absorption. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Cancellous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
