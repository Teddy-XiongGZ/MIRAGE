    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periosteum is a dense layer of connective tissue that covers the outer surface of bones. It contains blood vessels, nerves, and cells involved in bone growth and repair, but it is not the most metabolically active layer in the bone. The endosteum is a thin layer of connective tissue that lines the inner surface of bones. It contains cells involved in bone remodeling and repair, making it more metabolically active than the periosteum. Cancellous bone, also known as spongy or trabecular bone, is a type of bone tissue that has a lattice-like structure with open spaces filled with bone marrow. It is highly metabolically active due to its high surface area and involvement in bone remodeling. Cortical bone, also known as compact bone, is the dense outer layer of bone that provides strength and support. While it is important for structural integrity, it is not as metabolically active as cancellous bone. Therefore, the most metabolically active layer in the bone is the cancellous bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
