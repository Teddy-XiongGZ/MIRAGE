    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Open reduction of condylar fracture is indicated in certain situations where conservative management is not appropriate. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Condyle fracture along with body fracture: This is a possible indication for open reduction as it may require surgical intervention to properly align and stabilize the fractured segments.\\n\\nB. Lateral displacement of the condyle (or) Lateral fracture dislocation condyle: This is also a possible indication for open reduction as it involves a significant displacement of the condyle that may require surgical intervention.\\n\\nC. 200 angulations: This option is not clear and does not provide enough information to determine if it is an absolute indication for open reduction.\\n\\nD. Condyle is separated from the stump: This is a possible indication for open reduction as it suggests a complete separation of the condyle from its normal position, which may require surgical intervention to reposition and stabilize it.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, options A, B, and D are possible indications for open reduction. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the absolute indication. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/D\"}"
