    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the least amount of mercury required, we need to consider the different types of dental alloys. \\n\\nA. Admixed alloy: This type of alloy is a mixture of lathe cut alloy and spherical alloy. It requires a higher amount of mercury compared to other types.\\n\\nB. Spherical alloy: This type of alloy has spherical particles and requires a moderate amount of mercury.\\n\\nC. Hybrid alloy: This type of alloy is a combination of lathe cut alloy and spherical alloy. It requires a higher amount of mercury compared to other types.\\n\\nD. Lathe cut alloy: This type of alloy has irregularly shaped particles and requires the least amount of mercury compared to other types.\\n\\nBased on this information, the answer is D. Lathe cut alloy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
