    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cyst occurring under the tongue, caused by obstruction of a salivary gland, is commonly known as a ranula. A ranula is a mucus-filled cyst that forms when the duct of a salivary gland becomes blocked or damaged. It typically appears as a bluish or translucent swelling under the tongue. Mucocele is a term used to describe a similar cyst that occurs on the lower lip or inside the mouth, but not specifically under the tongue. Dermoid cysts are typically found in the head and neck region, but they are not specifically associated with salivary glands. Dentigerous cysts are associated with the crowns of unerupted teeth, and are not related to salivary glands or the tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Ranula\"}"
