    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A thinner mix refers to a mix with more water content. Gypsum products, such as plaster of Paris, undergo a setting process where they harden and solidify. Increasing the water content in the mix will result in a higher water-to-gypsum ratio. This excess water can lead to increased setting expansion, as the gypsum particles absorb the water and expand during the setting process. Therefore, the answer is A. Increased setting expansion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
