    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The nerve that supplies the ear lobule is responsible for providing sensory innervation to this area. The greater auricular nerve supplies the skin over the parotid gland and the angle of the mandible, but not the ear lobule. The lesser occipital nerve supplies the skin of the posterior scalp, but not the ear lobule. The facial nerve is responsible for motor innervation of the muscles of facial expression and taste sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but it does not supply the ear lobule. The auriculotemporal nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3), supplies the skin of the external ear, including the ear lobule. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Auriculotemporal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
