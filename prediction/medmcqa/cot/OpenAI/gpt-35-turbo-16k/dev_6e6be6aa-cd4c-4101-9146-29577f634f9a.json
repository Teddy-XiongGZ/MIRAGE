    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's history and presentation, it is likely that the husband has herpes zoster (shingles) infection. The patient is currently pregnant and has been exposed to the rash. The next step in the management would be to administer varicella immunoglobulin to the patient. This is because varicella immunoglobulin can help prevent or reduce the severity of varicella infection in susceptible individuals, including pregnant women. Administering high dose acyclovir to the patient or the infant at birth is not indicated in this case, as the patient does not have a confirmed diagnosis of herpes zoster or varicella infection. Administering varicella immunoglobulin to the infant at birth is also not necessary, as the patient's HIV status is negative and the risk of vertical transmission of varicella is low.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Administer varicella immunoglobulin to the patient\"}"
