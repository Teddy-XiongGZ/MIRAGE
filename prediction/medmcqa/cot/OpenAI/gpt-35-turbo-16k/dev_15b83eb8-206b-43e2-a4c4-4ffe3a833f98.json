    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Light transmitting wedges are optical devices that are designed to transmit light. The percentage of incident light that is transmitted through the wedge depends on its optical properties. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the typical range of light transmission for such wedges. A. 70-80% of incident light: This is a relatively low range of light transmission and may not be typical for light transmitting wedges. B. 80-85% of incident light: This is a slightly higher range of light transmission, but it is still relatively low. C. 85-90% of incident light: This range of light transmission is more likely for light transmitting wedges. It is a reasonable percentage for light to be transmitted through the wedge. D. 90-95% of incident light: This is a high range of light transmission and may not be typical for light transmitting wedges. Based on the typical properties of light transmitting wedges, the most likely answer is C. 85-90% of incident light.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
