    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resilient silicone denture lining materials are superior to plasticized acrylic resin as: 1. Bond strength with a denture is increased: This is not necessarily true. The choice of denture lining material does not directly affect the bond strength with a denture. 2. They remain resilient for a short time: This is not true. Resilient silicone denture lining materials are designed to maintain their resilience over a longer period of time compared to plasticized acrylic resin. 3. They do not support fungal growth: This is true. Resilient silicone denture lining materials have a smooth surface that is resistant to fungal growth, while plasticized acrylic resin can provide a favorable environment for fungal growth. 4. Tissue adaptation is better: This is true. Resilient silicone denture lining materials have better tissue adaptation compared to plasticized acrylic resin. They can conform to the shape of the underlying tissues, providing better comfort and reducing the risk of tissue irritation or inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. They do not support fungal growth\"}"
