    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To assess long term glucose control, we need a measure that reflects the average blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Estimation of post prandial blood sugar and fasting blood sugar can provide information about short-term glucose control, but they do not give a comprehensive picture of long-term control. Estimation of urine sugar level is not a reliable indicator of glucose control as it can be affected by various factors. On the other hand, estimation of blood level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a widely used test to assess long-term glucose control. HbA1c reflects the average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months, making it a suitable choice for long-term assessment of glucose control.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
