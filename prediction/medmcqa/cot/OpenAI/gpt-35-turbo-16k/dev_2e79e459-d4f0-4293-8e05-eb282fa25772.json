    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cell membrane is a selectively permeable barrier that surrounds the cell and separates the intracellular environment from the extracellular environment. It is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, which consists of two layers of phospholipids. Phospholipids are a type of lipid that have a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail. The hydrophilic heads face outward towards the aqueous environments, while the hydrophobic tails face inward, creating a barrier that prevents the free movement of most substances. In addition to lipids, the cell membrane also contains proteins that are embedded within the phospholipid bilayer. These proteins serve various functions, such as transport of molecules across the membrane, cell signaling, and structural support. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Lipids and proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
