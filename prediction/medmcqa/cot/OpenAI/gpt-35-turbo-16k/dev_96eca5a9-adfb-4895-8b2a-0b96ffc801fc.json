    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A cyst that moves by protruding the tongue is most likely a ranula. A ranula is a cyst that forms in the floor of the mouth due to blockage of the salivary gland duct. When the cyst is filled with saliva, it can cause the tongue to be pushed upward and forward, resulting in the appearance of the cyst moving. Thyroglossal cysts are located in the midline of the neck and do not typically cause movement of the tongue. Median rhomboid cysts are rare and usually present as a midline neck mass. Tracheal cysts are located in the trachea and would not cause movement of the tongue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Ranula\"}"
