    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxillary teeth are innervated by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (V2). The most difficult maxillary tooth to anaesthetize by infiltration is usually the 1st molar. This is because the roots of the 1st molar are often close to the maxillary sinus, making it difficult for the local anesthetic to reach the nerve endings. The 1st premolar, canine, and 3rd molar are generally easier to anaesthetize by infiltration compared to the 1st molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
