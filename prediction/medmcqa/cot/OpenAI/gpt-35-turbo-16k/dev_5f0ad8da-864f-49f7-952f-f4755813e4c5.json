    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Calcium in blood can be regulated by various hormones. Calcitonin is a hormone that decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting the release of calcium from bones and increasing calcium excretion by the kidneys. Parathormone, on the other hand, increases blood calcium levels by stimulating the release of calcium from bones and increasing calcium reabsorption by the kidneys. TNF alpha is not directly involved in calcium regulation. Insulin also does not directly affect blood calcium levels. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Parathormone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
