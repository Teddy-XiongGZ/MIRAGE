    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Perinatal mortality refers to the number of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths per 1,000 total births. It includes both fetal deaths (stillbirths) and neonatal deaths (deaths within the first 7 days of life). The numerator in perinatal mortality is the number of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths. Option A, post neonate death with weight 2.5 kg, is not correct because it refers to deaths that occur after the neonatal period, which is the first 28 days of life. Option B, early neonatal with weight 1000 grams, is not correct because it refers to deaths that occur within the first 7 days of life and does not include stillbirths. Option C, abortion of < 500 gram fetus, is not correct because it refers to abortions (termination of pregnancy) and not perinatal mortality. Option D, stillbirth of fetus > 500 grams, is correct. Stillbirths are fetal deaths that occur after 20 weeks of gestation or when the fetus weighs more than 500 grams. This is included in the numerator of perinatal mortality.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
