    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Confounding refers to the presence of a variable that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome, and that may distort the observed relationship between them. To remove confounding, various methods can be used. Randomization is a method that helps to distribute potential confounders equally between the treatment groups, thus reducing the likelihood of confounding. Random selection is a method used in sampling to ensure that the study population is representative of the target population, but it does not directly address confounding. Matching is a method used to create comparable groups by matching individuals in the treatment and control groups based on certain characteristics, which can help control for confounding. Blinding is a method used to prevent bias in the assessment of outcomes, but it does not directly address confounding. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Blinding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
