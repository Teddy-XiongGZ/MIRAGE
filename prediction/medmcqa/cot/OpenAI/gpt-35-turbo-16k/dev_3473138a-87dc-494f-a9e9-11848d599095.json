    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The property by which the transformation from sol to gel and gel to sol occurs in reversible hydrocolloid is a function of the concentration of fillers and plasticizer. Fillers and plasticizers are added to the hydrocolloid to control its consistency and texture. They help in the formation of a gel by absorbing water and swelling. When the concentration of fillers and plasticizers is increased, the hydrocolloid becomes more viscous and forms a gel. On the other hand, when the concentration is decreased, the hydrocolloid becomes less viscous and transforms back into a sol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
