    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fingerprinting typically involves recording prints of all 10 fingers, including both thumbs. However, in this question, it states that only 8 fingers are being recorded. Therefore, we need to determine which finger pair is excluded. To do this, we can eliminate the fingers that are commonly included in fingerprinting, which are the thumbs. Therefore, the finger pair that is most likely excluded is the thumb pair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Thumb\"}"
