    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Working side contact refers to the contact between the teeth on the working (or moving) side of the mouth during chewing or grinding. To determine which option is correct, we need to understand the terms 'lateral movement' and 'medial movement'. Lateral movement refers to the side-to-side movement of the lower jaw during chewing, while medial movement refers to the movement towards the midline of the mouth. Based on this understanding, we can conclude that working side contact would mean contact on the lateral movement, as the teeth on the working side come into contact during this movement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
