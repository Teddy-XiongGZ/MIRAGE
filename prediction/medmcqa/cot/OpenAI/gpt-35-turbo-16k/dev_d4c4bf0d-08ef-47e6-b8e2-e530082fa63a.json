    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Narrow angle glaucoma is a condition where the angle between the iris and the cornea is narrow, leading to increased intraocular pressure. The goal of treatment is to reduce intraocular pressure. Certain drugs can worsen narrow angle glaucoma by causing pupillary dilation, which can further narrow the angle and increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, the drug that should not be given in a patient with narrow angle glaucoma is the one that causes pupillary dilation. A. Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic drug that causes pupillary dilation and should be avoided in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. B. Timolol is a beta-blocker that reduces intraocular pressure and is commonly used in the treatment of glaucoma. It does not cause pupillary dilation and can be safely used in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. C. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces intraocular pressure and can be used in the treatment of glaucoma. It does not cause pupillary dilation and can be safely used in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. D. Homatropine is an anticholinergic drug that causes pupillary dilation and should be avoided in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Based on this information, the drug that should not be given in a patient of narrow angle glaucoma is D. Homatropine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
