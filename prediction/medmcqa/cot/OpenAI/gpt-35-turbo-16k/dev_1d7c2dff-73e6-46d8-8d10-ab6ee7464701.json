    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of a vascular plaque along the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve since birth suggests a congenital vascular anomaly. Sturge Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a facial port-wine stain (vascular plaque) involving the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. This condition is typically present at birth and remains unchanged in morphology throughout life. Infantile hemangioma is a common benign vascular tumor that appears after birth and grows rapidly during the first year of life. Congenital hemangioma is a rare type of hemangioma that is fully formed at birth. Proteus syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth of multiple tissues. Given the clinical presentation of a vascular plaque present since birth, the most likely possibility is Sturge Weber syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
