    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cementum is a specialized connective tissue that covers the root of a tooth, while bone is a hard, mineralized connective tissue that forms the skeleton. Both cementum and bone undergo resorption, which is the process of breaking down and removing tissue. However, the rate of resorption differs between cementum and bone. Cementum resorbs less readily compared to bone. This is because cementum is less vascularized and has fewer cells involved in the resorption process. On the other hand, bone is highly vascularized and contains various cells, such as osteoclasts, that are responsible for resorption. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Less readily.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
