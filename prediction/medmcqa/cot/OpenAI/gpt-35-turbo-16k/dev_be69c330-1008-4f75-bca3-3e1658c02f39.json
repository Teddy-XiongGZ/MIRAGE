    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid tooth separation is a technique used in orthodontics to create space between teeth quickly. To determine the principle behind rapid tooth separation, we need to consider the options provided. A. Wedge principle: The wedge principle involves using a wedge-shaped device to create space between teeth. This device is placed between the teeth and gradually expanded to separate them. B. Traction principle: The traction principle involves applying a pulling force to move teeth apart. This can be achieved using various techniques such as elastic bands or springs. Considering the options, both the wedge principle and the traction principle can be used in rapid tooth separation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
