    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sphenoidal air sinus is located in the sphenoid bone, which is part of the skull. To determine which nerve supplies the sphenoidal air sinus, we need to consider the anatomical structures and their innervation. The posterior ethmoidal nerve supplies the posterior ethmoidal air cells, which are located in the ethmoid bone. The posterior superior nerve supplies the superior nasal concha. The sphenoidal nerve is not a recognized nerve in human anatomy. The infratemporal nerve supplies the muscles of mastication and is not directly related to the sphenoidal air sinus. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Posterior ethmoidal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
