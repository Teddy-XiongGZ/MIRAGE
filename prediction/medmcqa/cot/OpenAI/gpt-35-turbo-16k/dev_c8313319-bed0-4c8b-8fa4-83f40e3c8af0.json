    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the history of fall on outstretched hand, we can suspect a fracture in the forearm or wrist. Let's analyze the given options:\\n\\nA. Galeazzi fracture: This is a fracture of the radius with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. It is not typically associated with a fall on outstretched hand.\\n\\nB. Montaggia fracture: This is a fracture of the proximal ulna with dislocation of the radial head. It is also not typically associated with a fall on outstretched hand.\\n\\nC. Colles fracture: This is a fracture of the distal radius with dorsal displacement of the distal fragment. It is a common fracture seen in falls on outstretched hand, making it a likely possibility.\\n\\nD. Smith fracture: This is a fracture of the distal radius with volar displacement of the distal fragment. It is less common in falls on outstretched hand compared to Colles fracture.\\n\\nBased on the given information, the most likely fracture is a Colles fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Colles fracture\"}"
