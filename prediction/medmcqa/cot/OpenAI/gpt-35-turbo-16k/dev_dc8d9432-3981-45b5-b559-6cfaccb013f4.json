    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High Copper Amalgam is a type of dental filling material that contains a high percentage of copper. Copper is known to enhance the strength and corrosion resistance of amalgam. Therefore, it is unlikely that corrosion does not occur at all in High Copper Amalgam. Electrochemical corrosion occurs when there is a flow of electric current between different metals in the presence of an electrolyte. Chemical corrosion occurs when a material reacts with its environment, such as acids or other chemicals. Penetrating corrosion refers to the corrosion that penetrates into the material. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Corrosion does not occur at all.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
