    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibrous histiocytoma is a benign soft tissue tumor that can occur in various locations. To determine the most common site of involvement, we need to consider the typical locations where fibrous histiocytoma is known to occur. A. Eyelid: Fibrous histiocytoma can occur on the eyelid, but it is not the most common site of involvement. B. Epibular: Epibular is not a recognized anatomical location, so it is unlikely to be the most common site of involvement. C. Intraocular: Fibrous histiocytoma is not typically found within the eye itself, so this is not the most common site of involvement. D. Orbit: The orbit, which is the bony socket that houses the eye, is a known location for fibrous histiocytoma. It is the most common site of involvement for this tumor. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Orbit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
