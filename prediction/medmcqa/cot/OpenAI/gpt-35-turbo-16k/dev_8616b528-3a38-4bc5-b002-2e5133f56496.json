    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms of rotatory vertigo and nausea in the morning on change in position of the head are suggestive of a peripheral vestibular disorder. Labyrinthitis is characterized by sudden onset of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus, which are not mentioned in the question. Vestibular neuronitis typically presents with acute onset of continuous vertigo, without hearing loss or tinnitus. Meniere's disease is characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness, which are not mentioned in the question. BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) is the most likely diagnosis in this case, as it is characterized by brief episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position, such as rolling over in bed or looking up. BPPV is often associated with nausea and can be diagnosed with a Dix-Hallpike maneuver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
