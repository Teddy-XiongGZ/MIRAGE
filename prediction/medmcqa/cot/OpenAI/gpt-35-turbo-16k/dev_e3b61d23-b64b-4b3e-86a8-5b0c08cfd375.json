    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which disease affects neurons only, we need to consider the characteristics of each option. \\n\\nA. Spinocerebellar ataxia is a genetic disorder that affects the coordination of movements. It primarily affects the cerebellum, but it can also involve other parts of the nervous system, including neurons.\\n\\nB. Supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and balance. It primarily affects the brainstem and basal ganglia, which contain neurons.\\n\\nC. Corticobasillar degeneration is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and cognition. It primarily affects the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia, which contain neurons.\\n\\nD. Multiple system atrophy is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, autonomic functions, and coordination. It primarily affects multiple systems, including the cerebellum, brainstem, and basal ganglia, which contain neurons.\\n\\nBased on this information, none of the options exclusively affect neurons only. Therefore, the answer is none of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
