    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To perform a valid student-t test between means of two groups, the following conditions must be met:\\n\\n1. The number of observations in each group should be approximately the same. This is important because the t-test assumes that the samples are drawn from populations with the same variance.\\n\\n2. The standard deviation of the two groups should be approximately the same. If the standard deviations are significantly different, it can affect the validity of the t-test.\\n\\n3. The means of the two groups do not need to be approximately the same. The t-test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.\\n\\n4. The sample size should be large enough. While there is no specific threshold for the sample size, a larger sample size generally provides more reliable results. However, the t-test can still be used with small sample sizes as long as the other assumptions are met.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
