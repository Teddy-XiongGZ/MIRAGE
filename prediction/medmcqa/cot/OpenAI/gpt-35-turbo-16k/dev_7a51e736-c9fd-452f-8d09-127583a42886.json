    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The neurovascular bundle consists of the major blood vessels and nerves that supply the leg. To determine which compartment of the leg does not contain the neurovascular bundle, we need to understand the anatomy of the leg. The leg is divided into four compartments: anterior, lateral, deep posterior, and superficial posterior. The anterior compartment contains the anterior tibial artery and vein, as well as the deep peroneal nerve. The lateral compartment contains the fibular artery and vein, as well as the superficial peroneal nerve. The deep posterior compartment contains the posterior tibial artery and vein, as well as the tibial nerve. The superficial posterior compartment contains the sural arteries and veins, as well as the sural nerve. Based on this information, we can conclude that the compartment without the neurovascular bundle is the superficial posterior compartment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Superficial posterior\"}"
