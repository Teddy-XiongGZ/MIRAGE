    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sudden drainage of 1,500 mL blood from the left side after chest tube insertion in a polytrauma patient indicates a significant hemorrhage. The oxygen saturation of 92% suggests that the patient is not in immediate respiratory distress. The next step should be to auscultate for left chest breath sounds to assess for any signs of tension pneumothorax or hemothorax. If breath sounds are absent or significantly decreased, immediate intervention such as open thoracotomy may be necessary. If breath sounds are present and the patient remains stable, the next step would be to transfer the patient to a trauma center for further evaluation and management. Clamping the chest tube is not recommended as it may lead to tension pneumothorax or hemothorax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
