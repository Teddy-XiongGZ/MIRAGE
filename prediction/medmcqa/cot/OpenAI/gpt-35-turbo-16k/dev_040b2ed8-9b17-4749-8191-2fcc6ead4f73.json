    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Discontinuation syndrome refers to a set of symptoms that can occur when a person abruptly stops taking certain medications. These symptoms can vary depending on the specific drug involved. To determine which drug can result in anxiety and insomnia causing discontinuation syndrome, we need to consider the potential withdrawal effects of each drug listed. A. Venlafaxine: Abrupt discontinuation of venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, and agitation. B. Imipramine: Abrupt discontinuation of imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), can also result in withdrawal symptoms including anxiety and insomnia. C. Valproate: Valproate, an anticonvulsant medication, is not typically associated with discontinuation syndrome or withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety and insomnia. D. Olanzapine: Abrupt discontinuation of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, can cause withdrawal symptoms but anxiety and insomnia are not commonly reported. Based on this information, the drug that can result in anxiety and insomnia causing discontinuation syndrome is either A. Venlafaxine or B. Imipramine. To make a definitive choice, we need to consider the specific withdrawal effects of each drug. Since both venlafaxine and imipramine can cause anxiety and insomnia upon discontinuation, the answer is: \", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Venlafaxine or B. Imipramine\"}"
