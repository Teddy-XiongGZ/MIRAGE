    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the tonsils, which are two small glands located in the back of the throat. It is commonly performed in children to treat recurrent tonsillitis or sleep-disordered breathing. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not true regarding tonsillectomy in children: A. Extracapsular approach is best for cold approach: This statement is true. The extracapsular approach, also known as partial tonsillectomy, is often preferred for children with recurrent tonsillitis as it removes only a portion of the tonsils, leaving some tissue intact. B. Sleep apnea is an indication: This statement is true. Sleep apnea, a condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, is one of the indications for tonsillectomy in children. Removing the tonsils can help improve airflow and alleviate sleep apnea symptoms. C. Adenoids should also be removed if significantly involved: This statement is true. The adenoids are another set of glands located in the back of the nasal cavity. If the adenoids are significantly involved or enlarged, they are often removed along with the tonsils during a procedure called adenotonsillectomy. D. Cricothyroid region is high and anterior in children than adults: This statement is not true. The cricothyroid region, which refers to the area where the cricoid cartilage and thyroid cartilage meet, is actually lower and more anterior in children compared to adults. This anatomical difference can make intubation and airway management more challenging in pediatric patients. Based on the above analysis, the answer choice that is not true regarding tonsillectomy in children is D. Cricothyroid region is high and anterior in children than adults.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
