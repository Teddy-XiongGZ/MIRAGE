    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Medicines that are labeled 'store at a cool place only' should be kept at a temperature that is lower than room temperature but not too cold. The purpose of storing them at a cool place is to prevent degradation or alteration of the medication. Let's evaluate the options: \\n\\nA. 8-15 degC: This temperature range is generally considered cool, but it may be slightly higher than what is required for storing medicines labeled as 'cool place only'. \\nB. 2-8 degC: This temperature range is commonly referred to as refrigerator temperature. It is a suitable range for storing medicines that require cool storage. \\nC. 0 degC: This temperature is freezing point and is generally considered too cold for storing most medications. \\nD. 25-28 degC: This temperature range is closer to room temperature and is not considered cool. \\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is B. 2-8 degC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
