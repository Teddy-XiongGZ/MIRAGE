    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following causes lysis of clot, we need to understand the process of clot formation and lysis. Clot formation involves the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by the enzyme thrombin. Once the clot is formed, it can be broken down or lysed by the enzyme plasmin. Hyaluronidase is not involved in clot formation or lysis. Coagulase is an enzyme produced by some bacteria that promotes clot formation, not lysis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Plasmin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
