    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The afferent nerve fibers of the pulp are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the pulp to the central nervous system. These fibers carry pain, temperature, and touch sensations. A. Parasympathetic post ganglionic: Parasympathetic fibers are responsible for regulating rest and digest functions, such as salivation and digestion. They do not transmit sensory information. B. Sympathetic post ganglionic: Sympathetic fibers are responsible for the fight or flight response and do not transmit sensory information. C. Parasympathetic pre ganglionic: Parasympathetic fibers are responsible for regulating rest and digest functions, such as salivation and digestion. They do not transmit sensory information. D. Sympathetic preganglionic: Sympathetic preganglionic fibers are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. They are involved in the fight or flight response. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Sympathetic preganglionic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
