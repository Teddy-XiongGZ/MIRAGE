    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulpectomy and pulp capping are dental procedures performed to treat the pulp of a tooth. In primary teeth, these procedures are more successful due to certain factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Increased odontoblastic activity in the young: Odontoblasts are cells responsible for dentin formation. Increased odontoblastic activity can contribute to the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping. \\n\\nB. Increased blood supply through the wide apex: A wide apex can allow for better blood supply, which is important for the success of these procedures. \\n\\nC. Increased volume of pulp in primary teeth: Primary teeth generally have a larger pulp volume compared to permanent teeth. This increased volume can provide a better chance for successful pulpectomy and pulp capping. \\n\\nD. Lesser amount of collagen fibers in young: Collagen fibers are present in the pulp and can affect the success of these procedures. A lesser amount of collagen fibers in young teeth may contribute to better outcomes.\\n\\nConsidering these factors, the most likely answer is C. Increased volume of pulp in primary teeth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
