    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Orthodontically treated midline diastema refers to the gap between the upper front teeth that has been corrected through orthodontic treatment. To retain the corrected position of the teeth and prevent the diastema from reopening, a retainer is typically used. Option A: Hawley's appliance for 6 months - Hawley's appliance is a type of removable retainer that consists of a wire that goes across the front teeth and an acrylic plate that rests against the roof of the mouth. While it can be effective in retaining the corrected position of the teeth, 6 months may not be sufficient for long-term retention. Option B: Hawley's appliance for 12 months - Extending the duration of wearing the Hawley's appliance to 12 months can provide better long-term retention and stability of the corrected position of the teeth. This option is a common choice for retaining orthodontic treatment results. Option C: Bonded lingual retainer - A bonded lingual retainer is a fixed retainer that is bonded to the back surfaces of the upper front teeth. It is a thin wire that is not visible from the front and provides continuous retention. This option is often preferred for retaining the corrected position of the teeth, especially in cases of midline diastema. Option D: No need for retainer as it is self-retained - This option is not recommended as the corrected position of the teeth may not be stable without a retainer, especially in cases of midline diastema. Considering the options, the best choice for retaining orthodontically treated midline diastema is Option C: Bonded lingual retainer, as it provides continuous retention and stability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
