    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Abdominal desmoid tumors are rare, locally aggressive tumors that arise from the connective tissue in the abdomen. They can occur in various locations within the abdomen, including the abdominal wall, mesentery, and retroperitoneum. The most common presentation of abdominal desmoid tumors is an abdominal mass. These tumors typically grow slowly and can become quite large, causing a noticeable mass in the abdomen. Abdominal pain may also be present, but it is not the most common presentation. Fever and urinary retention are not typically associated with abdominal desmoid tumors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
