    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Augmented genioplasty is a surgical procedure that is performed to enhance the appearance of the chin. It involves modifying the shape and size of the chin to achieve a more balanced facial profile. A. Sliding horizontal osteotomy: This technique involves making a horizontal cut in the chin bone and moving it forward or backward to achieve the desired projection. While this procedure can be used to correct a receding chin, it is not specifically referred to as augmented genioplasty. B. Bone grafts: Bone grafts involve taking bone from one part of the body and transplanting it to another area, in this case, the chin. While bone grafts can be used in chin augmentation procedures, they are not the primary method used in augmented genioplasty. C. Silicone implants: Silicone implants are commonly used in augmented genioplasty. They are inserted through a small incision in the mouth or under the chin and placed on top of the chin bone to enhance its size and shape. D. None of the above: This option is incorrect as both bone grafts and silicone implants can be used in augmented genioplasty. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Silicone implants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
