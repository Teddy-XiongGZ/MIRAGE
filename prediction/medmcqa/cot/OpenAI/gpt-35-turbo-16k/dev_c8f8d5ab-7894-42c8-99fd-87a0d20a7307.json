    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which premolar has a mesial marginal ridge more cervical than the distal marginal ridge, we need to understand the anatomy of premolars. Premolars have two cusps, a mesial and a distal. The mesial marginal ridge is the ridge that runs along the mesial surface of the tooth, while the distal marginal ridge runs along the distal surface. In general, the mesial marginal ridge is more cervical (closer to the gum line) than the distal marginal ridge. Now, let's analyze the options: A. Maxillary 1st premolar: This premolar has a mesial marginal ridge more cervical than the distal marginal ridge. B. Maxillary 2nd premolar: This premolar has a mesial marginal ridge more cervical than the distal marginal ridge. C. Mandibular 1st premolar: This premolar has a mesial marginal ridge more cervical than the distal marginal ridge. D. Mandibular 2nd premolar: This premolar has a mesial marginal ridge more cervical than the distal marginal ridge. Based on the analysis, all of the options have a mesial marginal ridge more cervical than the distal marginal ridge. Therefore, the correct answer is: A/B/C/D (all of the above).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/C/D\"}"
