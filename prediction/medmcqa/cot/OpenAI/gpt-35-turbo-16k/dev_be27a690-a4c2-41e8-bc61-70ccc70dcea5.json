    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pseudomonas is a gram-negative bacterium that is commonly found in soil, water, and plants. It is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause infections in humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not true.\\n\\nA. Pseudomonas is not a strict aerobe. It is a facultative anaerobe, which means it can grow in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer.\\n\\nB. Pseudomonas has the ability to grow in disinfectants commonly used in hospitals, such as quaternary ammonium compounds. This ability is due to its intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Therefore, option B is not the correct answer.\\n\\nC. Pseudomonas infections can be acquired from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Endogenous sources refer to the patient's own flora, while exogenous sources refer to external sources such as contaminated medical devices or healthcare workers. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer.\\n\\nD. Pseudomonas is indeed a common organism in burn patients. Burn wounds provide an ideal environment for the growth of Pseudomonas, and it is one of the most common pathogens associated with burn infections. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Most common organism in burn patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
