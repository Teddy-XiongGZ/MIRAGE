    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening infection involving the submandibular space. It is characterized by rapidly progressive bilateral cellulitis of the submandibular, sublingual, and submental spaces. The infection can spread rapidly and compromise the airway. Therefore, the first treatment step should focus on securing the airway and providing appropriate antibiotic coverage. A. Incision and drainage: While incision and drainage may be necessary to drain any abscesses present, it is not the first step in the management of Ludwig's angina. B. Start IV antibiotics and ICU admission: This is the correct first treatment step. Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is essential to cover the likely pathogens, which are predominantly anaerobic bacteria. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is necessary for close monitoring and airway management. C. Tracheostomy under GA: Tracheostomy may be required in cases where there is severe airway compromise or impending airway obstruction. However, it is not the first treatment step and should be considered if other measures fail. D. Fiberoptic intubation/tracheostomy under LA: Fiberoptic intubation or tracheostomy under local anesthesia may be considered in cases where there is difficulty in intubation or tracheostomy is not immediately available. However, it is not the first treatment step and should be considered if other measures fail.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Start IV antibiotics and ICU admission\"}"
