    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a condition characterized by rapid breathing in a newborn. It is caused by the delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. TTN is commonly seen in situations where there is inadequate clearance of lung fluid. Let's analyze the given options:\\n\\nA. Term delivery requiring forceps: The use of forceps during delivery does not directly affect the clearance of lung fluid, so this is unlikely to be the correct answer.\\n\\nB. Term requiring ventouse: Similar to forceps, the use of ventouse during delivery does not directly affect the clearance of lung fluid, so this is also unlikely to be the correct answer.\\n\\nC. Elective caesarean section: In an elective caesarean section, the baby is not subjected to the normal process of labor and vaginal delivery, which helps in the clearance of lung fluid. Therefore, this is a possible answer.\\n\\nD. Normal vaginal delivery: During a normal vaginal delivery, the baby passes through the birth canal, which helps in the clearance of lung fluid. This is the most likely situation where TTN is commonly seen.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Normal vaginal delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
