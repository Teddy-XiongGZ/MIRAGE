    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"White, spongy, folded thick mucosa can be seen in several conditions. Let's go through each option to determine the correct answer. \\n\\nA. Oral hairy leukoplakia: Oral hairy leukoplakia is a white, corrugated, and non-removable lesion caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. It typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. However, it does not present as spongy or folded mucosa, so this option is unlikely to be the correct answer. \\n\\nB. Aspirin burn: Aspirin burn refers to a chemical burn caused by the topical application of aspirin. It can result in white, necrotic tissue, but it does not typically present as spongy or folded mucosa. Therefore, this option is also unlikely to be the correct answer. \\n\\nC. White spongy nevus: White spongy nevus is a rare genetic disorder characterized by thickened, white, spongy mucosa. It is usually present from birth and can affect the oral mucosa as well as other mucosal surfaces. Given the description, this option seems to be the most likely answer. \\n\\nD. Pseudomembranous Candidiasis: Pseudomembranous candidiasis, also known as oral thrush, is a fungal infection caused by Candida species. It typically presents as white, curd-like plaques that can be easily wiped off, leaving an erythematous base. While it can cause white mucosal changes, it does not typically present as spongy or folded mucosa. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the most likely answer is C. White spongy nevus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
