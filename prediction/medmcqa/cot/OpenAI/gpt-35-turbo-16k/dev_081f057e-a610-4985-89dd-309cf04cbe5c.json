    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nociceptive signals are signals related to pain. To determine where these signals are primarily transmitted, we need to consider the pathways involved in pain transmission. The nucleus caudalis is a part of the trigeminal sensory complex and is involved in the transmission of pain signals from the face and head. The limbic system is responsible for emotions and memory, but it is not primarily involved in the transmission of pain signals. The reticular system is involved in regulating arousal and consciousness, but it is not primarily involved in pain transmission. The superior cervical ganglion is part of the sympathetic nervous system and is not primarily involved in pain transmission. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Nucleus caudalis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
