    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells. This mutation results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S. The mutation in sickle cell anemia is a point mutation, where a single nucleotide base is substituted for another. This substitution leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, causing the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped and less flexible. Therefore, the answer is A. Point.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
