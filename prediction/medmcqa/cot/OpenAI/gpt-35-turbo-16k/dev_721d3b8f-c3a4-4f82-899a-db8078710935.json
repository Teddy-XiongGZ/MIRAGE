This can affect certain measurements of fetal maturity. The L/S ratio (lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio) is a measurement of lung maturity and is not affected by a bloody tap. Phosphatidyl glycerol is another marker of lung maturity and is also not affected by a bloody tap. \u03b1-fetoprotein is a marker for neural tube defects and is not related to fetal maturity. Bilirubin, as measured by DOD 450, is a test used to assess the risk of Rh disease in the fetus and is not directly related to fetal maturity. Therefore, the correct answer is A. L/S ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
