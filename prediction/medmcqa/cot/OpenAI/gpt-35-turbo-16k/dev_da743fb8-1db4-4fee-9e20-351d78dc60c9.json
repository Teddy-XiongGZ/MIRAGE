    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with edema, oliguria, and frothy urine, which are suggestive of a renal problem. The presence of 3+ proteinuria indicates significant protein loss in the urine. The absence of RBCs, WBCs, and casts suggests that the problem is not related to inflammation or infection. The serum albumin level of 2.5 gm/L is low, indicating hypoalbuminemia. The serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL is within the normal range, suggesting preserved kidney function. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is minimal change disease, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and young adults. It is characterized by selective proteinuria, normal renal function, and minimal changes on renal biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
