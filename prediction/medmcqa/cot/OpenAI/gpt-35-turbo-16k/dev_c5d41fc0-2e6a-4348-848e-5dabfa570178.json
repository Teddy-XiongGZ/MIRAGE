    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The 500ml fluid deficit indicates that there is excessive fluid absorption during the surgery. This can be due to the use of glycine as the irrigating fluid, which is known to be absorbed systemically. The next step should be to address the fluid deficit and prevent further complications. Option A, stopping the surgery, may not be necessary if the patient is stable. Option B, changing the fluid to normal saline, may help reduce the risk of fluid absorption but may not address the existing fluid deficit. Option D, giving furosemide, a diuretic, may help increase urine output but may not be sufficient to correct the fluid deficit. Therefore, the best option would be C, to continue the surgery with careful monitoring of fluid status. This would involve closely monitoring the patient's vital signs, urine output, and fluid balance during the surgery to ensure that the deficit is corrected and the patient remains stable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
