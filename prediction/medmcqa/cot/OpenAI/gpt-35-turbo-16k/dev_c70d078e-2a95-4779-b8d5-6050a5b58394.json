    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nitrous oxide (NO) is commonly used as an analgesic in medical procedures. The minimum concentration of oxygen needed in NO analgesia is important to ensure patient safety. The goal is to maintain adequate oxygenation while providing pain relief. The minimum concentration of oxygen needed in NO analgesia is typically 30%. This ensures that there is enough oxygen available to prevent hypoxia and maintain normal oxygen saturation levels. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 30%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
