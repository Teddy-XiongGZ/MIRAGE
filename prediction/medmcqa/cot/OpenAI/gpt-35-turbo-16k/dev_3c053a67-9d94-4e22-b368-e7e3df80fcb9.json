    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Direct pulp capping is a procedure in which a dental material is placed directly over an exposed dental pulp to promote healing and prevent the need for root canal treatment. The goal is to maintain the vitality of the pulp and allow it to regenerate. A. Mechanical exposure: In this situation, there is a direct mechanical exposure of the dental pulp, such as from a traumatic injury or a fracture. Direct pulp capping can be done in this case to protect the pulp and promote healing. B. No bleeding: Bleeding is an important sign that indicates the vitality of the pulp. If there is no bleeding, it suggests that the pulp may already be necrotic or non-vital. Direct pulp capping is not done in this situation because the pulp is not expected to heal. C. Pinpoint exposure: Pinpoint exposure refers to a small, localized exposure of the dental pulp. Direct pulp capping can be done in this case as long as there is bleeding and the exposure is not extensive. D. Carious exposure with more than 1 mm in size: Carious exposure refers to an exposure of the dental pulp due to dental decay. If the exposure is more than 1 mm in size, it is considered extensive. Direct pulp capping is not done in this situation because the risk of infection and failure is higher. Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is D. Carious exposure with more than 1 mm in size.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
