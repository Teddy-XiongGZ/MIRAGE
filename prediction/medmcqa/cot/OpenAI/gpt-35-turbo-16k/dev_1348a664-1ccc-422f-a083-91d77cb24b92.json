    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the natural disaster causing maximum deaths, we need to consider the historical data and statistics. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Hydrological: This refers to disasters related to water, such as floods and tsunamis. While these can cause significant damage and loss of life, they may not necessarily be the leading cause of maximum deaths.\\n\\nB. Meteorological: This includes disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and storms. These can also result in significant casualties, but again, they may not be the primary cause of maximum deaths.\\n\\nC. Geological: This category encompasses earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. These disasters can cause widespread devastation and loss of life, making them potential contenders for causing maximum deaths.\\n\\nD. Fires: While fires can be devastating, they are not typically considered as the primary cause of maximum deaths in natural disasters.\\n\\nConsidering the above analysis, the most likely answer would be C. Geological, as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides have historically caused significant loss of life.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
