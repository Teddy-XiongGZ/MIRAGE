    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent extrusion of matrix beyond the apex, an apical stop is created. This is typically done during endodontic procedures. Let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. Resistance form: Resistance form refers to the preparation of a tooth to resist displacement or removal of a restoration. It is not directly related to preventing extrusion of matrix beyond the apex. \\n\\nB. Retention form: Retention form refers to the design of a cavity preparation to retain a restoration. It is also not directly related to preventing extrusion of matrix beyond the apex. \\n\\nC. Convenience form: Convenience form refers to the shape and design of a cavity preparation to facilitate access, visibility, and ease of instrumentation. It is not directly related to preventing extrusion of matrix beyond the apex. \\n\\nBased on the analysis, none of the above options directly describe the creation of an apical stop to prevent extrusion of matrix beyond the apex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None of the above.\"}"
