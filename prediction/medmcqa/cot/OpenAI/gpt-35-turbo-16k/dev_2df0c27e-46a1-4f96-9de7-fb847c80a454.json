    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Swine flu is currently in the news, which suggests that it is a prevalent and widespread disease. To determine whether it is a pandemic, epidemic, endemic, or seasonal variation, we need to understand the definitions of these terms. A pandemic refers to a global outbreak of a disease, affecting a large number of people across different countries or continents. An epidemic, on the other hand, refers to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease within a specific community or region. Endemic refers to the constant presence and regular occurrence of a disease within a specific population or area. Seasonal variation refers to the fluctuation in the occurrence of a disease based on the time of year. Considering the information provided, swine flu is not specified to be a global outbreak affecting multiple countries or continents, so it is unlikely to be a pandemic. It is also not specified to be limited to a specific community or region, so it is unlikely to be an epidemic. However, swine flu is currently in the news, suggesting that it is prevalent and widespread, which aligns with the definition of an endemic disease. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is C. Endemic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
