    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the odd drugs for anaesthetic emergencies, we need to consider the drugs commonly used in anaesthetic emergencies. Aminophylline, Epinephrine, and Atropine sulfate are commonly used in anaesthetic emergencies for different purposes. Aminophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat bronchospasm, Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor used to treat hypotension and anaphylaxis, and Atropine sulfate is an anticholinergic used to treat bradycardia. On the other hand, Amoxicillin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections and is not typically used in anaesthetic emergencies. Therefore, the odd drug for anaesthetic emergencies is D. Amoxicillin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
