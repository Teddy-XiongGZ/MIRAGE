    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the acid-base abnormality, we need to analyze the ABG results. The pH is within the normal range (7.35-7.45), indicating a normal acid-base balance. The pCO2 is also within the normal range (35-45 mmHg), suggesting normal respiratory function. The HCO3 level is within the normal range (22-28 mEq/L), indicating normal bicarbonate levels. Therefore, based on the ABG results, there is no evidence of acid-base abnormality.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. No acid base abnormality\"}"
