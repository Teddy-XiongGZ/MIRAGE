    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker that is commonly used in the treatment of various conditions. To determine the drug of choice for the given options, we need to consider the pharmacological properties of propranolol and the characteristics of each condition. A. Ulcerated infantile hemangioma: Propranolol is indeed the drug of choice for ulcerated infantile hemangioma. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the size and promoting the regression of these vascular tumors. B. Lymphangioma: Propranolol is not the drug of choice for lymphangioma. Lymphangiomas are benign tumors of the lymphatic system, and propranolol is not typically used in their treatment. C. Pyogenic granuloma: Propranolol is not the drug of choice for pyogenic granuloma. Pyogenic granulomas are benign vascular lesions that typically occur on the skin or mucous membranes. Propranolol is not commonly used in their treatment. D. Capillary malformation: Propranolol is not the drug of choice for capillary malformation. Capillary malformations, also known as port-wine stains, are congenital vascular malformations. Propranolol is not typically used in their treatment. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is A. Ulcerated infantile hemangioma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
