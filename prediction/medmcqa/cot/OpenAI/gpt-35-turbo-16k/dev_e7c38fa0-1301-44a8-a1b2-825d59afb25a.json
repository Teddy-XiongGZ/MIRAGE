    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During implant placement, it is important to consider the maximum torque that should be applied. The maximum torque is the maximum amount of rotational force that can be safely applied to the implant without causing damage. Exceeding the maximum torque can lead to implant failure or damage to the surrounding bone. To determine the maximum torque, it is important to consider the type of implant being placed and the specific manufacturer's recommendations. These recommendations can vary depending on the implant system and the specific implant size. It is important to follow the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure successful implant placement. Given the options provided, we need to choose the maximum torque value that should not be exceeded. Let's evaluate the options: A. 100 N, B. 50 N, C. 60 N, D. 70 N. Based on general guidelines, the maximum torque for implant placement is typically recommended to be between 35-45 Ncm (Newton centimeters). None of the options provided fall within this range. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
