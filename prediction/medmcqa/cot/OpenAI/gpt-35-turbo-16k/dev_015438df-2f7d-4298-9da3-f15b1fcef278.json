    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polymerization shrinkage refers to the contraction that occurs when a composite material undergoes the process of polymerization. Let's evaluate each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. Polymerization shrinkage is greater if bonded surface area is lesser than unbounded surface area: This statement is true. When the bonded surface area is smaller than the unbounded surface area, there is less resistance to the shrinkage forces, leading to greater shrinkage.\\n\\nB. Polymerization shrinkage is high if within the enamel margins: This statement is true. Enamel margins provide a rigid boundary, which restricts the composite's ability to shrink. This can result in higher shrinkage stress within the enamel margins.\\n\\nC. Acid etching and priming will decrease polymerization shrinkage: This statement is false. Acid etching and priming are used to improve the bond strength between the composite and the tooth structure, but they do not directly affect the polymerization shrinkage.\\n\\nD. Microleakage can occur because of polymerization shrinkage: This statement is true. Polymerization shrinkage can create gaps between the composite and the tooth structure, leading to microleakage.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer choice that is NOT true is C. Acid etching and priming will decrease polymerization shrinkage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
