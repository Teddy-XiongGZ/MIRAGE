    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Embalming refers to the process of preserving a dead body by treating it with chemicals to prevent decomposition. Issuing a death certificate is a legal requirement to officially declare the cause of death. Punishments for embalming without issuing a death certificate would be mentioned in the Indian Penal Code (IPC). To find the correct section, we need to refer to the IPC. Let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. IPC 201: This section deals with causing disappearance of evidence of an offense. It is not directly related to embalming without issuing a death certificate. \\n\\nB. IPC 297: This section deals with trespassing on burial places, and does not specifically address embalming without issuing a death certificate. \\n\\nC. IPC 299: This section deals with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It is not directly related to embalming without issuing a death certificate. \\n\\nD. IPC 498: This section deals with cruelty towards a married woman by her husband or relatives. It is not directly related to embalming without issuing a death certificate. \\n\\nBased on the analysis, none of the options provided directly address the punishment for embalming without issuing a death certificate. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
