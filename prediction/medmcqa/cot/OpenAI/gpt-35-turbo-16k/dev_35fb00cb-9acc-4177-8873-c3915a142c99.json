    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following exists as yeast at 37 degrees and hyphae at 25 degrees, we need to consider the temperature-dependent morphological characteristics of each organism. A. Histoplasma capsulatum: Histoplasma capsulatum exists as a yeast form at both 37 degrees and 25 degrees. It does not exhibit hyphal growth. B. Sporothrix globosa: Sporothrix globosa exists as a mold form with hyphae at both 37 degrees and 25 degrees. It does not exhibit yeast form growth. C. Candida albicans: Candida albicans exists as a yeast form at 37 degrees and as a hyphal form at 25 degrees. It exhibits both yeast and hyphal growth. D. Cryptococcus neoformans: Cryptococcus neoformans exists as a yeast form at both 37 degrees and 25 degrees. It does not exhibit hyphal growth. Based on the above information, the organism that exists as yeast at 37 degrees and hyphae at 25 degrees is Candida albicans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
