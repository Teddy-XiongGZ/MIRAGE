    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the optimal anti-rotational design in a blade, we need to consider the offset. The offset refers to the distance between the center of rotation and the center of mass of the blade. A larger offset helps to increase stability and reduce rotational forces. However, if the offset is too large, it can lead to imbalance and other issues. The question asks for the maximum offset that should be incorporated, so we need to choose the option with the smallest value. Therefore, the answer is A. 2 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
