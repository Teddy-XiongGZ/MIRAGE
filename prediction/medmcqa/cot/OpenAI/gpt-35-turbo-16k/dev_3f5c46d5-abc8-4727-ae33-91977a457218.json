    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the flap technique for pocket elimination and to increase the width of attached gingiva, we need to consider the different options and their indications. \\n\\nA. Coronally repositioned flap: This technique is used to cover root surfaces and increase the width of attached gingiva. It involves detaching the gingival tissue and repositioning it coronally.\\n\\nB. Apically repositioned flap: This technique is used to cover root surfaces and increase the width of attached gingiva. It involves detaching the gingival tissue and repositioning it apically.\\n\\nC. Lateral pedicel flap: This technique is used to cover root surfaces and increase the width of attached gingiva. It involves detaching the gingival tissue and repositioning it laterally.\\n\\nD. Modified widman flap: This technique is used for pocket elimination and involves removing the pocket lining and reshaping the gingival tissue. It does not specifically aim to increase the width of attached gingiva.\\n\\nBased on the options provided, the flap technique that is specifically used to increase the width of attached gingiva is the lateral pedicel flap (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
