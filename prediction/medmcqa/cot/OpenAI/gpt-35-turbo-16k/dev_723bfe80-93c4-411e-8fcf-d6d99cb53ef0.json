    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the minimum width required in the ridge for placing 2 implants of size 4 mm, we need to consider the space required for each implant and any additional space needed for proper spacing between the implants. Each implant of size 4 mm will require a minimum width of 4 mm. Since we have 2 implants, the total space required for the implants alone would be 4 mm x 2 = 8 mm. In addition to the space required for the implants, we also need to consider the spacing between the implants. The recommended minimum spacing between implants is typically around 3 mm. Therefore, we need to add an additional 3 mm to the total space required. Adding the space required for the implants (8 mm) and the additional spacing (3 mm), the minimum width required in the ridge would be 8 mm + 3 mm = 11 mm. Therefore, none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) are correct. The correct answer is not listed among the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
