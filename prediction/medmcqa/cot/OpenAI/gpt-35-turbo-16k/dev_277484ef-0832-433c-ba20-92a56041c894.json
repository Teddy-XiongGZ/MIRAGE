    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a child with tetralogy of Fallot, a cyanotic spell is a sudden episode of severe cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes) caused by a decrease in pulmonary blood flow. This can occur due to various triggers, such as fever, crying, or dehydration. To identify the surest sign of a cyanotic spell in this child, we need to consider the characteristic features of tetralogy of Fallot and its associated complications. Option A: Hepatomegaly is not a specific sign of a cyanotic spell in tetralogy of Fallot. While hepatomegaly can occur in some cases due to chronic hypoxia and congestive heart failure, it is not the surest sign of a cyanotic spell. Option B: The absence of a murmur is not the surest sign of a cyanotic spell in tetralogy of Fallot. While a murmur may be absent during a cyanotic spell due to decreased pulmonary blood flow, its absence alone is not the surest sign. Option C: S3 gallop rhythm is not the surest sign of a cyanotic spell in tetralogy of Fallot. S3 gallop rhythm is typically associated with left ventricular dysfunction and is not specific to a cyanotic spell. Option D: Aerial oxygen saturation of less than 75% is the surest sign of a cyanotic spell in tetralogy of Fallot. During a cyanotic spell, there is a sudden decrease in pulmonary blood flow, leading to severe hypoxemia. This can be detected by measuring the oxygen saturation level, which is typically less than 75% during a cyanotic spell. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Aerial oxygen saturation of less than 75%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
