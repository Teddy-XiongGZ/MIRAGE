    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a patient has an allergy to costume jewelry, it is important to identify the specific metal or material that is causing the allergic reaction. In this case, the potential choices are high gold, low gold, palladium - Ag, and Ni - Cr. Step 1: High gold: Gold is generally considered hypoallergenic and less likely to cause allergic reactions. However, some individuals may still be allergic to gold, especially if it is mixed with other metals or alloys. Step 2: Low gold: Low gold refers to gold that has a lower percentage of gold content and is mixed with other metals or alloys. This can increase the risk of allergic reactions in individuals who are sensitive to these metals. Step 3: Palladium - Ag: Palladium and silver (Ag) are both metals that are commonly used in jewelry. While they are generally considered to be hypoallergenic, some individuals may still have allergic reactions to these metals. Step 4: Ni - Cr: Nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr) are metals that are commonly used in costume jewelry. They are known to be common allergens and can cause allergic reactions in individuals who are sensitive to them. Based on this information, the metal that is contraindicated in a patient with an allergy to costume jewelry is Ni - Cr (choice D) because nickel and chromium are known allergens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
