The scaphoid bone is located in the wrist and is commonly injured in this mechanism of injury. The x-ray should be carefully evaluated for any signs of a scaphoid fracture, such as a visible fracture line or signs of displacement. The other options, including scaphoid-lunate fracture, distal radius fracture, and ulnar fracture, are less likely based on the given history and location of pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
