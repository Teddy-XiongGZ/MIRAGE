    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Odd-chain fatty acids have an odd number of carbon atoms. During \u03b2-oxidation, the fatty acid is broken down into two-carbon units called acetyl CoA. However, in the case of odd-chain fatty acids, the last round of \u03b2-oxidation produces a three-carbon unit called propionyl CoA. This propionyl CoA can then be converted into succinyl CoA through a series of enzymatic reactions. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Propionyl CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
