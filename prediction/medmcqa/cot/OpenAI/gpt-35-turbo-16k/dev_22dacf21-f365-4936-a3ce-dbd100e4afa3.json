    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. It is caused by antibodies that block or destroy acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The symptoms of myasthenia gravis typically involve the muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, swallowing, and speaking. The key features of myasthenia gravis include ptosis (drooping of the eyelids) and muscle fatigability (weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest). Absent deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) can also be seen in myasthenia gravis due to the impaired neuromuscular transmission. However, the pupillary reflex, which involves the constriction of the pupil in response to light, is not directly affected by myasthenia gravis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Normal pupillary reflex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
