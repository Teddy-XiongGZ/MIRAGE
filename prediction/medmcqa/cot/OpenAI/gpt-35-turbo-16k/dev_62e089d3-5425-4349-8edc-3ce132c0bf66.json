    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In molecular biology, the 5' to 3' direction refers to the orientation of nucleic acid synthesis. DNA repair, DNA replication, and transcription all occur in the 5' to 3' direction. However, RNA editing is a process that involves modifying RNA molecules after transcription, and it can occur in either the 5' to 3' or 3' to 5' direction. Therefore, the correct answer is C. RNA editing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
