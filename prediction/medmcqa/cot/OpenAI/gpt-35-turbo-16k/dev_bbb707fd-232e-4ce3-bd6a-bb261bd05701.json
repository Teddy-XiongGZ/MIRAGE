    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most common cause of death in acute poliomyelitis is respiratory failure. Poliomyelitis is a viral infection that primarily affects the nervous system, including the motor neurons in the spinal cord. The virus can cause paralysis of the muscles involved in breathing, leading to respiratory failure. Intercostal muscles paralysis can contribute to respiratory failure, but it is not the most common cause of death. Convulsions and cardiac arrest are not typically associated with acute poliomyelitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Respiratory failure\"}"
