    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anti-centromere antibodies are specific autoantibodies that are associated with a particular autoimmune condition. To determine which condition is associated with anti-centromere antibodies, we need to consider the known associations of these antibodies. Drug-induced lupus is not typically associated with anti-centromere antibodies. SLE, or systemic lupus erythematosus, is associated with a variety of autoantibodies, but anti-centromere antibodies are not commonly seen in this condition. Sjogren syndrome is primarily associated with anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, not anti-centromere antibodies. Scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis, is strongly associated with anti-centromere antibodies. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Scleroderma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
