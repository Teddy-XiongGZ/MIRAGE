    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When there is a divergence from the contact area in proximal surfaces, it causes embrasures. Embrasures are the triangular spaces between the proximal surfaces of adjacent teeth and can be found in different directions. In this case, the divergence is occurring in the proximal surfaces, so the embrasures will be present in the same direction. Therefore, the answer is D. Facially, lingually, cervically & occlusally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
