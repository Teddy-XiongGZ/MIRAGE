    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To store blood for an extended period of time, an anticoagulant preservative is required to prevent clotting and maintain the viability of the blood. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one can be used to store blood for 35 days.\\n\\nA. Acid citrate dextrose (ACD): ACD is commonly used as an anticoagulant preservative for blood storage. However, it is typically used for shorter storage periods, usually up to 21 days.\\n\\nB. CPD Citrate phosphate dextrose: CPD is another commonly used anticoagulant preservative for blood storage. It can be used for up to 35 days, making it a potential option.\\n\\nC. Citrate phosphate dextrose-adenine (CPD-A): CPD-A is a variant of CPD that includes adenine. It is primarily used for the storage of red blood cells and has a shelf life of up to 35 days.\\n\\nD. CP2D - citrate phosphate double dextrose: CP2D is not a commonly used anticoagulant preservative for blood storage. There is limited information available on its storage capabilities.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, options B (CPD Citrate phosphate dextrose) and C (Citrate phosphate dextrose-adenine) are both potential choices for storing blood for 35 days. However, CPD is more commonly used and widely available, making it the preferred option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
