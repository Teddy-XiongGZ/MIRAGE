Actinic degeneration: Actinic degeneration refers to changes in the skin caused by chronic exposure to sunlight. It is not directly related to vitamin A deficiency.\\n\\nB. Hyperplasia of goblet cells: Vitamin A deficiency can lead to a decrease in goblet cells, resulting in decreased mucus production and dryness of the conjunctiva. Therefore, hyperplasia of goblet cells is not a characteristic change seen in conjunctiva after vitamin A deficiency.\\n\\nC. Hyperkeratosis of squamous epithelium: Vitamin A deficiency can cause squamous metaplasia, which is characterized by the transformation of the normal conjunctival epithelium into a keratinized squamous epithelium. This change is known as hyperkeratosis of squamous epithelium.\\n\\nD. Stromal infiltration: Stromal infiltration refers to the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the conjunctival stroma. It is not a specific change seen in conjunctiva after vitamin A deficiency.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Hyperkeratosis of squamous epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
