    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing agitation and anger issues as a result of taking levetiracetam. The first step would be to assess whether these symptoms are directly related to the medication. If there is a clear temporal relationship between starting levetiracetam and the onset of these symptoms, it is likely that the medication is causing these side effects. In such cases, the next best step would be to consider stopping or changing the medication. Since the patient has been seizure-free for 2 years, it is reasonable to consider stopping levetiracetam. However, abrupt discontinuation of antiepileptic medications can increase the risk of seizures. Therefore, it would be prudent to slowly taper the drug over a period of time to minimize the risk of seizure recurrence. Option C, slowly tapering the drug over the next 6 months, would be the most appropriate next step in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
