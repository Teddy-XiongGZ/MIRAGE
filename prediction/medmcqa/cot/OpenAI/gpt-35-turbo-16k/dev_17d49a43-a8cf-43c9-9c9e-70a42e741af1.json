    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To check objective pain response, we need to consider methods that directly measure pain or pain-related reflexes. The facial pain scale (choice A) is a subjective measure that relies on the patient's self-report of pain, so it may not be the best choice for objective assessment. The knee jerk reflex (choice B) is a reflex response that tests the integrity of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, but it does not directly measure pain. The H-reflex (choice C) is an electrophysiological test that assesses the integrity of the sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord, but it also does not directly measure pain. The R III reflex (choice D) is an objective measure of pain response that assesses the nociceptive withdrawal reflex. This reflex is elicited by a painful stimulus and involves the withdrawal of the limb. Therefore, the best method to check objective pain response among the given choices is the R III reflex (choice D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
