    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), acts on the kidneys to regulate water reabsorption. It does this by binding to vasopressin receptors in specific parts of the nephron. To determine which part of the nephron the vasopressin antagonist acts on, we need to understand where vasopressin normally acts. Vasopressin primarily acts on the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting ducts. The proximal convoluted tubule is responsible for the reabsorption of most of the filtered water and solutes, but it is not directly affected by vasopressin. The cortical collecting tubule is also not directly affected by vasopressin. The medullary collecting duct, on the other hand, is the main site of action for vasopressin. Therefore, the vasopressin antagonist would act on the medullary collecting duct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
