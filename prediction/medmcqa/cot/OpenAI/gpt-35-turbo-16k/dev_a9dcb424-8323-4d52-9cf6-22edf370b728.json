    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which joint histologically and morphologically best simulates the TMJ, we need to consider the characteristics of each potential choice. A. 5th costochondral graft: The 5th costochondral graft is a cartilage graft taken from the 5th rib. While it contains cartilage, it does not closely resemble the TMJ in terms of its histology or morphology. B. 3rd metatarsal graft: The 3rd metatarsal graft is a bone graft taken from the 3rd metatarsal bone in the foot. It does not contain cartilage and is not similar to the TMJ in terms of its histology or morphology. C. Sternoclavicular graft: The sternoclavicular graft is a cartilage graft taken from the sternoclavicular joint. This joint is located between the sternum and the clavicle. It contains cartilage and has a similar histology and morphology to the TMJ. D. None of the above: This option suggests that none of the provided choices accurately simulate the TMJ. Based on the information provided, the sternoclavicular graft (option C) is the joint that histologically and morphologically best simulates the TMJ.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
