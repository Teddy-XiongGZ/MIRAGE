    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After Le-Fort 1 osteotomy, the blood supply of the maxilla is maintained by the arteries that supply the maxilla. The posterior superior alveolar artery (A) supplies the posterior part of the maxilla, including the maxillary sinus and the molars. The anterior superior alveolar artery (B) supplies the anterior part of the maxilla, including the incisors and canines. The greater palatine artery (C) supplies the hard palate. The ascending palatine branch of the facial artery (D) supplies the soft palate. Since the Le-Fort 1 osteotomy involves a horizontal cut above the level of the maxillary sinus, it does not directly affect the blood supply from the posterior superior alveolar artery. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Posterior superior alveolar artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
