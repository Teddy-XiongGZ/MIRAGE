    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Atypical root canal or root refers to the presence of additional canals or roots in a tooth, which deviate from the normal anatomy. To determine which tooth has the highest incidence of atypical root canal or root, we need to consider the anatomy of each tooth. A. Mandibular 1st premolar: This tooth typically has two roots and two canals, which is considered the normal anatomy. It is less likely to have atypical root canal or root. B. Mandibular canine: This tooth usually has a single root and a single canal, which is also considered the normal anatomy. It is less likely to have atypical root canal or root. C. Maxillary 1st premolar: This tooth typically has two roots and two canals, which is considered the normal anatomy. It is less likely to have atypical root canal or root. D. Mandibular 2nd premolar: This tooth usually has a single root and a single canal, which is the normal anatomy. However, it is known to have a higher incidence of atypical root canal or root compared to other teeth. Based on the above analysis, the tooth with the highest incidence of atypical root canal or root among all teeth is the Mandibular 2nd premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
