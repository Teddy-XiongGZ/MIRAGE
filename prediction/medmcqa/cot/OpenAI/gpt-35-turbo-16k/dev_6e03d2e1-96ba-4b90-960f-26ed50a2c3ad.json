    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Full mouth disinfection is a dental procedure that involves the thorough cleaning and disinfection of the entire mouth, including the teeth, gums, and oral tissues. The purpose of this procedure is to eliminate or reduce the presence of harmful bacteria and prevent or treat gum disease. Typically, full mouth disinfection is done in multiple sessions or appointments, rather than all at once. The exact duration of the procedure can vary depending on the severity of the gum disease and the individual patient's needs. However, it is unlikely that full mouth disinfection would be completed within 24 hours, as this would not allow enough time for thorough cleaning and disinfection. Similarly, 36 hours may also be insufficient. Therefore, the most reasonable options would be either 48 hours or 72 hours. Between these two choices, 72 hours seems more likely, as it allows for a longer period of time to complete the procedure and ensure thorough disinfection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 72 hours\"}"
