    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vertucci classification is a system used to classify the root canal anatomy of teeth. According to Vertucci's classification, there are 8 types of root canal configurations. To determine which tooth exhibits all 8 types, we need to consider the anatomy of each tooth. A. 1st maxillary premolar: This tooth typically has two roots and two canals, which means it does not exhibit all 8 types of Vertucci. B. 2nd maxillary premolar: This tooth usually has one root and two canals, which means it does not exhibit all 8 types of Vertucci. C. 1st mandibular premolar: This tooth typically has one root and one canal, which means it does not exhibit all 8 types of Vertucci. D. 2nd mandibular premolar: This tooth usually has one root and one canal, which means it does not exhibit all 8 types of Vertucci. Based on the above analysis, none of the options (A, B, C, D) exhibit all 8 types of Vertucci. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
