    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gum pads are used to provide support and cushioning to the gums. They are typically placed in the mouth to cover the areas where the gums are sensitive or injured. To determine the correct number of gum pads, we need to consider the anatomy of the mouth. The mouth is divided into four quadrants: upper right, upper left, lower right, and lower left. Each quadrant consists of two jaws: the maxilla (upper jaw) and the mandible (lower jaw). Therefore, we need to determine how many gum pads are required in each quadrant or jaw.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
