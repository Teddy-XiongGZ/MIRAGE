    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pre-oxygenation is the process of increasing the oxygen concentration in the lungs before tracheal intubation. It helps to prolong the time until desaturation occurs during intubation attempts. The goal of pre-oxygenation is to achieve an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of at least 90%. The recommended duration for pre-oxygenation is typically 3-5 minutes. During this time, the patient is instructed to take deep breaths with a high-flow oxygen source, such as a non-rebreather mask or a bag-valve-mask. This allows for the replacement of nitrogen in the lungs with oxygen, creating a reservoir of oxygen that can be used during the apnea period of intubation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 3 min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
