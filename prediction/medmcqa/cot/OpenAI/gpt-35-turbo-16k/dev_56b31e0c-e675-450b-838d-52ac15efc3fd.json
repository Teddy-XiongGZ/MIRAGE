    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Transmission of HIV from mother to child can occur during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. To prevent transmission, several interventions are recommended. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Oral zidovudine to mother at 3rd trimester along with oral zidovudine to infant for 6 weeks: This is a recommended intervention to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Zidovudine is an antiretroviral medication that helps prevent the virus from replicating.\\n\\nB. Vitamin A prophylaxis to mother: Vitamin A prophylaxis does not directly prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child. It may have other benefits for the mother's health, but it is not specifically targeted at preventing HIV transmission.\\n\\nC. Vaginal delivery: Vaginal delivery can increase the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child compared to cesarean section. Therefore, it is not the preferred mode of delivery for HIV-positive mothers.\\n\\nD. Stopping breastfeed: Breastfeeding is a known route of HIV transmission. Therefore, stopping breastfeeding is an important measure to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Stopping breastfeed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
