    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms of paresthesias (tingling or numbness) and circumoral numbness during donation, along with tachycardia and ST-T changes on ECG, suggest a neurological and cardiovascular manifestation. Hypovolemic shock is unlikely as the donor's vitals remain stable. Seizures would present with other characteristic signs and symptoms. Allergic reactions typically involve skin manifestations such as hives or itching. Hypocalcemia can cause paresthesias and circumoral numbness, and it can also lead to cardiac manifestations such as tachycardia and ST-T changes on ECG. Therefore, the most likely reason for the donor's symptoms is hypocalcemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
