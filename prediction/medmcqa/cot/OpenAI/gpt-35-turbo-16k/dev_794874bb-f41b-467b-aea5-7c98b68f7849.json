    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is innervated by several nerves, including the auriculotemporal nerve, the masseteric nerve, and the auricular nerve. The auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3) and provides sensory innervation to the skin of the temple, external ear, and TMJ capsule. The facial nerve (VII) primarily innervates the muscles of facial expression and does not supply sensory innervation to the TMJ capsule. The masseteric nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3) and provides motor innervation to the masseter muscle, but not sensory innervation to the TMJ capsule. The auricular nerve primarily provides sensory innervation to the external ear and does not supply the TMJ capsule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
