    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A hypertonic solution is a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes compared to the surrounding cells or tissues. It is used to draw fluid out of cells and into the bloodstream, thereby increasing blood volume and improving circulation. Prolonged bowel surgery does not typically involve a significant loss of fluid or blood volume, so the use of a hypertonic solution may not be necessary in this case. Cardiac type IV shock is a severe form of shock that occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This condition often results in low blood volume and poor circulation, making the use of a hypertonic solution beneficial to increase blood volume and improve cardiac output. Brain injury can lead to cerebral edema, which is the accumulation of fluid in the brain tissue. In this case, the use of a hypertonic solution can help draw fluid out of the brain cells and reduce swelling. Burns can cause significant fluid loss due to damage to the skin barrier.
