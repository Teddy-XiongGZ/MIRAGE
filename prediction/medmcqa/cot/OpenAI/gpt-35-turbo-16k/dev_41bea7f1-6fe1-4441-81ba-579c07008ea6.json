    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most likely cause for the patient's sudden hypotension after 3 minutes of administration of epidural anesthesia with 3% Xylocaine with adrenaline is systemic absorption of the drug. Xylocaine with adrenaline is a vasoconstrictor, which means it causes constriction of blood vessels. However, if the drug is absorbed systemically, it can lead to systemic vasodilation and subsequent hypotension. Vasovagal effect is a reflex response that can cause hypotension, but it is less likely to occur immediately after administration of the drug. Allergy to the drug preparation can cause an allergic reaction, but it is less likely to cause sudden hypotension. Penetration into the subarachnoid space is not a likely cause for hypotension in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
