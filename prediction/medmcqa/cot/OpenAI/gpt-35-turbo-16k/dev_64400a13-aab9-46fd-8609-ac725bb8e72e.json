    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GFR (glomerular filtration rate) is the rate at which the kidneys filter blood. It is influenced by various factors. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Increased renal blood flow: Increased renal blood flow can lead to increased GFR as more blood is being filtered by the kidneys.\\n\\nB. Efferent arteriole constriction: Constriction of the efferent arteriole can increase GFR by increasing the pressure within the glomerulus.\\n\\nC. Renal stone in ureter: A renal stone in the ureter does not directly affect GFR. It may cause obstruction and impair urine flow, but it does not directly impact the filtration rate.\\n\\nD. Decreased oncotic pressure: Decreased oncotic pressure in the glomerulus can increase GFR by reducing the reabsorption of filtrate.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Renal stone in ureter, as it does not directly affect GFR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
