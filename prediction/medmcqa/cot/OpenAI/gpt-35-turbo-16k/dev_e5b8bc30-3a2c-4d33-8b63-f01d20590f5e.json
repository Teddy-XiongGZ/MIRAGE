    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the annual new case detection rate of leprosy, we need to know the number of new cases detected and the population size. The given options provide the rates per 10,000 population and per 100,000 population. We need to convert the rates to the same population size to compare them. To convert the rates, we can multiply the rate per 10,000 population by 10 to get the rate per 100,000 population. Now, let's compare the options: A. 0.66/10,000 population B. 0.66/100,000 population C. 9.7/10,000 population D. 9.7/100,000 population Since the given year is 2016, we need to find the data for that specific year. Based on the available data, the correct answer is option C. 9.7/10,000 population.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
