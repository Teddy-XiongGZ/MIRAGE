    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a tooth is avulsed (knocked out), it is important to act quickly to increase the chances of successful reimplantation. Here is the step-by-step approach:\\n\\n1. Retrieve the avulsed tooth: The first step is to locate the avulsed tooth and handle it carefully by the crown (the visible part of the tooth) to avoid damaging the root.\\n\\n2. Clean the tooth: Gently rinse the tooth with saline solution or milk to remove any debris or dirt. Avoid scrubbing the tooth as this can damage the delicate root surface.\\n\\n3. Reimplant the tooth: The tooth should be reimplanted as soon as possible. It is important to ensure that the tooth is correctly aligned with the adjacent teeth and pushed firmly into place. The patient should bite down gently on a clean cloth or gauze to hold the tooth in position.\\n\\nBased on the step-by-step approach, the correct answer is B. Rinse with saline and reimplant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
