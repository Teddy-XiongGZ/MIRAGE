    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In ophthalmological experiments, rabbits are commonly used due to their similarities to human eyes. When selecting animals for experiments, it is important to consider their size and weight. Rabbits used in ophthalmological experiments are typically smaller in size compared to other animals used in research. They are usually bred specifically for research purposes and are not the same as domestic pet rabbits. Considering this, it is unlikely that the usual weight of rabbits used in ophthalmological experiments would be as high as 10-12 kg. Additionally, rabbits weighing 5-7 kg would be quite large for this purpose. Therefore, the most likely weight range for rabbits used in ophthalmological experiments would be between 0.5-1 kg or 1.5-2.5 kg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. 0.5-1 kg or B. 1.5-2.5 kg\"}"
