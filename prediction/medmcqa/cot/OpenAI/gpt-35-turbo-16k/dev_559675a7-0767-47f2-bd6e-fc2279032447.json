    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If a bacteria is susceptible to both penicillin and Erythromycin, it means that both antibiotics can effectively kill or inhibit the growth of the bacteria. Therefore, using both antibiotics at the same time may seem like a good idea to maximize the effectiveness of treatment. However, it is important to consider the specific mechanisms of action of these antibiotics and any potential interactions between them. A. Penicillin is inactivated by erythromycin: This statement is not true. Penicillin and erythromycin have different mechanisms of action and do not directly interact with each other to cause inactivation. B. Erythromycin exerts its effects extracellularly: This statement is not relevant to the question. The question is about the appropriateness of using both antibiotics together, not the mechanism of action of erythromycin. C. Erythromycin enhances the \u03b2-lactamases activity: This statement is not true. Erythromycin does not enhance the activity of \u03b2-lactamases, which are enzymes that can break down penicillin and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. D. Penicillin is only effective against growing cells: This statement is also not true. Penicillin can be effective against both growing and non-growing bacteria. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is A. Penicillin is inactivated by erythromycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
