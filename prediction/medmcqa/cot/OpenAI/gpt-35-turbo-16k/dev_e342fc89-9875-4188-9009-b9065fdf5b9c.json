    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the alpha phase of Ti6Al4V, the stable element is titanium (Ti). This is because the alloy is primarily composed of titanium (Ti) with small amounts of aluminum (Al) and vanadium (V). While aluminum and vanadium are present in the alloy, they do not form stable phases in the alpha phase of Ti6Al4V. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Ti.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
