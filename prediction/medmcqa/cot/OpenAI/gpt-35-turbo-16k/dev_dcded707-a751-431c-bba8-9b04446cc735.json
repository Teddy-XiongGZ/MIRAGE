    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Detachment of myosin head from actin is caused by the release of ADP and Pi. When myosin binds to actin, it undergoes a conformational change and forms a cross-bridge. This cross-bridge allows myosin to pull on actin, resulting in muscle contraction. During this process, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi, providing the energy for the power stroke. Once the power stroke is complete, ADP and Pi are released from the myosin head, causing the detachment of myosin from actin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
