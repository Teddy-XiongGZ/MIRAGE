    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, let's understand what aneuploidy is. Aneuploidy is a condition where there is an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell. Trisomy 21 refers to having an extra copy of chromosome 21, which leads to Down syndrome. Trisomy 18 refers to having an extra copy of chromosome 18, which leads to Edwards syndrome. A. 30% of trisomy 21 fetus die in utero: This statement is true. Trisomy 21 is associated with a higher risk of fetal death in utero compared to other aneuploidies. B. 80% of trisomy 18 fetus die in utero: This statement is true. Trisomy 18 is associated with a high rate of fetal death in utero, with approximately 80% of affected fetuses not surviving to term. C. Occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age: This statement is false. The occurrence of aneuploidy, such as trisomy 21 and trisomy 18, is strongly associated with the mother's age. The risk of having a child with aneuploidy increases with advancing maternal age. D. The recurrence risk for nondysjunctional aneuploidy is 1% higher: This statement is unclear and lacks context. It is difficult to determine the exact recurrence risk for nondysjunctional aneuploidy without more information. Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively classified as true or false based on the given information. Based on the above analysis, the answer choice is C. Occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
