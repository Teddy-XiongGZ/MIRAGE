    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reversible cell injury refers to cellular changes that can be reversed if the damaging stimulus is removed. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. ER swelling: This is a characteristic feature of reversible cell injury. When cells are stressed, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can become dilated and swollen.\\n\\nB. Dens deposition of mitochondria: This is not a feature of reversible cell injury. Dens deposition of mitochondria is seen in irreversible cell injury, such as necrosis.\\n\\nC. Bleb: This is a characteristic feature of reversible cell injury. Blebs are small protrusions or bulges that form on the cell membrane when the cell is stressed.\\n\\nD. Detachment of ribosome: This is a characteristic feature of reversible cell injury. When cells are stressed, ribosomes can detach from the endoplasmic reticulum.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Dens deposition of mitochondria, as it is not a feature of reversible cell injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
