    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sequential arrangement of fetal scans typically follows a specific order to monitor the growth and development of the fetus. The first scan usually performed is the NT (nuchal translucency) scan, which is done between 11-14 weeks of pregnancy to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities. The next scan is the anomaly scan, also known as the anatomy scan, which is done around 18-20 weeks to evaluate the baby's organs and detect any structural abnormalities. The growth scan is then performed periodically throughout the pregnancy to monitor the baby's growth and ensure that it is progressing normally. The triple marker test, on the other hand, is a blood test that is usually done between 15-20 weeks to screen for certain genetic conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Anomalous Scan and NT scan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
