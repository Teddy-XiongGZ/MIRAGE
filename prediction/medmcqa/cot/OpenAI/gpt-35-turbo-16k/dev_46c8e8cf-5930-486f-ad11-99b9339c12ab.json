    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reticular fibers are a type of collagen fibers that provide structural support in various tissues. To determine where reticular fibers are not present, we need to understand the locations where they are commonly found. Reticular fibers are abundant in lymphoid organs such as the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, where they form a network that supports the immune cells. They are also found in bone marrow, where they provide support for hematopoietic cells. Therefore, the correct answer is the location where reticular fibers are not present.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Bone marrow\"}"
