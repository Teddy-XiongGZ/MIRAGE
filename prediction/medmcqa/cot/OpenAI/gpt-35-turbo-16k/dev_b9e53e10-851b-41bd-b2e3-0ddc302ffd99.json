    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with stridor, which is a high-pitched sound caused by the obstruction of the airway. This indicates a potential airway emergency. The immediate management in such cases is to secure the airway. Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure to create an opening in the trachea, which can be planned or performed immediately. High dose steroids may be beneficial in reducing airway inflammation, but they are not the immediate management for an obstructed airway. Intubation and bronchodilator administration followed by observation for 12 hours is not recommended as it delays the definitive management. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate management in this case would be immediate tracheostomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Immediate tracheostomy\"}"
