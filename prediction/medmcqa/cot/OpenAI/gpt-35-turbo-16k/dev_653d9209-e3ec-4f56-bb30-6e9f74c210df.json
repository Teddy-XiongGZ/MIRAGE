    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The isolation period for measles refers to the duration during which an infected individual should be kept away from others to prevent the spread of the disease. Measles is a highly contagious viral infection. Let's break down the potential choices:\\n\\nA. Onset of prodromal stage until 7th day of rash: The prodromal stage is the initial phase of measles characterized by symptoms like fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes. The rash typically appears a few days after the onset of prodromal symptoms. This choice suggests that the isolation period starts from the onset of prodromal symptoms until the 7th day of the rash.\\n\\nB. Eruptive stage until 2 days of rash: The eruptive stage refers to the period when the rash is present. This choice suggests that the isolation period starts from the eruptive stage and lasts until 2 days after the rash appears.\\n\\nC. Onset of prodromal phase until 3rd day of rash: Similar to choice A, this option suggests that the isolation period starts from the onset of prodromal symptoms. However, it specifies that the isolation period ends on the 3rd day of the rash.\\n\\nD. Eruptive stage until 7th day of rash: This choice suggests that the isolation period starts from the eruptive stage and lasts until the 7th day of the rash.\\n\\nBased on the typical course of measles, the correct answer is choice D. The isolation period for measles extends from the eruptive stage until the 7th day of the rash.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
