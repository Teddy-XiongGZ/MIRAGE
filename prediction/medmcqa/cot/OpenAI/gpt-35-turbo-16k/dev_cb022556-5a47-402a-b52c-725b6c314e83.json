    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium nitroprusside is metabolized to form an active metabolite. This active metabolite of sodium nitroprusside acts through the activation of a specific enzyme. To determine which enzyme is activated, we need to consider the pharmacological effects of sodium nitroprusside and its active metabolite. Sodium nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that works by releasing nitric oxide (NO) in the body. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which then catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP acts as a second messenger and leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Therefore, the active metabolite of sodium nitroprusside activates guanylate cyclase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
