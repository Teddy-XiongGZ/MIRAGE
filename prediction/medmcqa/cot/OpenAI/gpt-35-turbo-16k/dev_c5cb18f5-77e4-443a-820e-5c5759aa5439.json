    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pseudotumour cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without any identifiable cause. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not true. A. Ventricular system is of normal size or small - This is true for pseudotumour cerebri as the ventricular system is typically not enlarged. B. CT Scan shows punctate hypodense areas - This is also true as punctate hypodense areas can be seen on CT scans of patients with pseudotumour cerebri. C. No focal neurological deficit - This is true as pseudotumour cerebri does not typically cause focal neurological deficits. D. Intracranial pressure is raised - This is true as increased intracranial pressure is a hallmark feature of pseudotumour cerebri. Therefore, the answer is D. Intracranial pressure is raised.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
