    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Nernst potential for an ion can be calculated using the Nernst equation: E = (RT/zF) * ln([ion]out/[ion]in), where E is the Nernst potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, z is the valence of the ion, F is Faraday's constant, [ion]out is the extracellular concentration of the ion, and [ion]in is the intracellular concentration of the ion. In this case, the ion is negative, so the valence (z) would be -1. Plugging in the values, we get: E = (RT/-1F) * ln(100/10). Since the natural logarithm of 100/10 is 2.3026, the equation simplifies to: E = (RT/-1F) * 2.3026. The negative sign in front of the equation indicates that the Nernst potential will be negative. Therefore, the correct answer is C. --61 mV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. --61 mV\"}"
