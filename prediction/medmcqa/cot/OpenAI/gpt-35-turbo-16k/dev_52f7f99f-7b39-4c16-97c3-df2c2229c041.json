    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the options is not an amino acid, we need to understand what amino acids are. Amino acids are organic compounds that contain an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to a central carbon atom. They also have a side chain (R group) that varies between different amino acids. Glycine, hydroxyproline, and glutamic acid are all amino acids. Glycine is the simplest amino acid with a hydrogen atom as its side chain. Hydroxyproline is an amino acid derived from proline, with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the side chain. Glutamic acid is an amino acid with a carboxyl group as its side chain. Choline, on the other hand, is not an amino acid. It is a water-soluble nutrient that is often grouped with B vitamins, but it does not meet the criteria of an amino acid. Therefore, the answer is D. Choline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
