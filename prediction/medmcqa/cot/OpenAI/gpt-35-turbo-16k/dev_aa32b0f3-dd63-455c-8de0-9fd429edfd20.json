    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 14-year-old girl who presents with absent thelarche (development of breast tissue). On examination, the uterus is present, indicating normal development of the internal female reproductive organs. The investigations show high FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), which suggests a problem with ovarian function. The karyotype is XY, indicating a male chromosomal pattern. Based on these findings, the most probable diagnosis is Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS). AIS is a condition where individuals with XY chromosomes have a partial or complete inability to respond to androgens (male hormones). This results in the development of female external genitalia and internal reproductive organs, but with absent or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast tissue (thelarche). The high FSH levels indicate that the ovaries are not functioning properly, which is consistent with AIS. Gonadal dysgenesis (Choice A) is a condition where the gonads (ovaries or testes) do not develop properly. This would typically result in absent or underdeveloped internal reproductive organs, such as the uterus. However, in this case, the uterus is present, suggesting normal development of the internal female reproductive organs. Kallman syndrome (Choice B) is a genetic disorder characterized by delayed or absent puberty and a reduced sense of smell (anosmia). It is not typically associated with high FSH levels or the presence of a uterus. Adrenal hyperplasia (Choice D) is a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands and can result in abnormal hormone production. It is not typically associated with absent thelarche or high FSH levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Androgen insensitivity syndrome\"}"
