    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infrahyoid muscles are a group of muscles located in the neck that are responsible for depressing the hyoid bone and larynx. To determine the motor supply of the infrahyoid muscles, we need to identify the nerve that innervates these muscles. A. Branches of the cervical plexus: The cervical plexus is a network of nerves located in the neck region. While it does provide motor innervation to some muscles in the neck, it does not specifically supply the infrahyoid muscles. B. Vagus nerve: The vagus nerve is a cranial nerve that provides motor innervation to several muscles in the neck and throat. However, it does not directly supply the infrahyoid muscles. C. Glossopharyngeal nerve: The glossopharyngeal nerve is another cranial nerve that provides motor innervation to some muscles in the throat, but it does not supply the infrahyoid muscles. D. Mandibular nerve: The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve and primarily supplies motor innervation to the muscles of mastication (chewing). It does not supply the infrahyoid muscles. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Branches of cervical plexus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
