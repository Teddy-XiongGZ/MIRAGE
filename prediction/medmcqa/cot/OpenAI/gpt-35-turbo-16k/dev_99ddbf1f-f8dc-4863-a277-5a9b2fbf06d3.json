    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Severe malaria is a life-threatening condition caused by the Plasmodium parasite. It is important to identify the signs and symptoms of severe malaria to provide appropriate treatment. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not true about severe malaria: A. Hypoglycemia, blood sugar level less than 40 mg: Hypoglycemia can occur in severe malaria due to the increased metabolic demands and impaired glucose metabolism. This is a true statement about severe malaria. B. Creatinine more than 3 mg/dL: Elevated creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which can occur in severe malaria due to the effects of the parasite on the kidneys. This is a true statement about severe malaria. C. LDH > 750 U/L: LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) is an enzyme that is released when cells are damaged. In severe malaria, the destruction of red blood cells can lead to an increase in LDH levels. This is a true statement about severe malaria. D. Hematocrit more than 15: Hematocrit is a measure of the proportion of red blood cells in the blood. In severe malaria, there is a significant loss of red blood cells due to their destruction by the parasite. This can lead to a decrease in hematocrit levels, not an increase. Therefore, this statement is not true about severe malaria. Based on the above analysis, the answer choice that is not true about severe malaria is D. Hematocrit more than 15.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
