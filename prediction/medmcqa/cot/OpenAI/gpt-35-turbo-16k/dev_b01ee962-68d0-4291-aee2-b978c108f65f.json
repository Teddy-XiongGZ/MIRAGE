    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Collagen is a structural protein that provides strength and support to various tissues in the body. There are different types of collagen, and they are found in different tissues. Long spaced collagen refers to collagen fibers that are arranged in a specific pattern with larger gaps between them. A. Diaphragm: The diaphragm is a muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. It primarily consists of skeletal muscle fibers and does not contain long spaced collagen. B. Cornea: The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye. It is composed of several layers, including the stroma, which contains collagen fibers. The collagen fibers in the cornea are arranged in a regular pattern, but they are not considered long spaced collagen. C. Basement membrane: The basement membrane is a thin, specialized extracellular matrix that underlies epithelial and endothelial cells. It provides support and acts as a barrier between different tissue compartments. The basement membrane contains collagen, but the collagen fibers are not long spaced. D. Tympanic membrane: The tympanic membrane, also known as the eardrum, is a thin membrane that separates the outer ear from the middle ear. It consists of three layers, including the fibrous layer, which contains collagen fibers. The collagen fibers in the fibrous layer of the tympanic membrane are arranged in a specific pattern with larger gaps between them, making it an example of long spaced collagen. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Tympanic membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
