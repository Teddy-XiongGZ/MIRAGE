    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Functional appliances are orthodontic devices used to correct skeletal class II malocclusions, which involve a retruded mandible relative to the maxilla. These appliances work by stimulating growth and development of the mandible, helping to bring it forward and improve the bite. Therefore, the correct indication for functional appliances in skeletal class II is when the mandible is retrognathic (option C). Options A and B are incorrect because they do not specifically mention a retrognathic mandible. Option D is also incorrect because severe crowding is not a specific indication for functional appliances in skeletal class II.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
