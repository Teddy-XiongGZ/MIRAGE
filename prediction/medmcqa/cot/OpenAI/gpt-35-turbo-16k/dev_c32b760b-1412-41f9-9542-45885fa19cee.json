    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The incidence of an extra canal in the mandibular first molar can vary depending on the population being studied. However, in general, the incidence is relatively low. To determine the answer, we need to consider the available options. A. 10%, B. 20%, C. 30%, D. 40%. Since the incidence is generally low, options C and D (30% and 40%) seem unlikely. Option A (10%) also seems too low. Therefore, the most reasonable choice would be B. 20%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
