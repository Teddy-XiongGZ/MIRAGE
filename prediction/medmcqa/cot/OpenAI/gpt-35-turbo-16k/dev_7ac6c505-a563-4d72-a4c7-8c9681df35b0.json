    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which type of wound does not involve the dermis, we need to understand the layers of the skin. The skin has three main layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The dermis is the middle layer of the skin, located between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue. An abrasion is a superficial wound that only affects the epidermis, so it does not involve the dermis. A contusion is a bruise that occurs when blood vessels under the skin rupture, but it does not involve a break in the skin. A laceration is a deep cut or tear in the skin that can involve the dermis. An incision is a deliberate cut made with a sharp object, and it can also involve the dermis. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Abrasion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
