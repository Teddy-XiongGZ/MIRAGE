    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Asphyxial injury in a term baby is a condition that occurs when there is a lack of oxygen supply to the baby's brain and other organs. This can happen during the birthing process or shortly after birth. The lack of oxygen can lead to various symptoms and complications. Let's go through each option to determine which one is not characteristic of asphyxial injury in a term baby: A. Seizures: Seizures can occur as a result of asphyxial injury in a term baby. Lack of oxygen to the brain can cause abnormal electrical activity and lead to seizures. So, this option is not the correct answer. B. Differential hypotonia (lower limbs > upper limbs): Differential hypotonia refers to a difference in muscle tone between different parts of the body. In asphyxial injury, hypotonia can occur, but it is usually generalized and affects both the upper and lower limbs. So, this option is not the correct answer. C. Altered sensorium: Asphyxial injury can cause a decrease in consciousness or altered sensorium. The baby may appear lethargic or have difficulty staying awake. So, this option is not the correct answer. D. Difficulty in clearing oral secretions: Asphyxial injury can affect the baby's ability to clear oral secretions. The lack of oxygen can lead to weak or ineffective sucking and swallowing reflexes, making it difficult for the baby to clear oral secretions. So, this option is the correct answer. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Difficulty in clearing oral secretions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
