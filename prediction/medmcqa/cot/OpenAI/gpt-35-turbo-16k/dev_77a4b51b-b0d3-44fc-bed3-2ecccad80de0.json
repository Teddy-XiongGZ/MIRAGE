    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key findings in this case are low serum phosphate levels and normal parathyroid hormone levels. This suggests a defect in phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys. Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by impaired acid secretion in the distal tubules, leading to metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. This is not consistent with the findings in this case. Proximal RTA is characterized by impaired bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules, leading to metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. Again, this is not consistent with the findings in this case. Hypophosphatemic rickets is a condition characterized by low serum phosphate levels, normal parathyroid hormone levels, and skeletal abnormalities. However, in this case, the patient has normal parathyroid hormone levels and no skeletal abnormalities are mentioned. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is vitamin D dependent rickets, which is characterized by low serum phosphate levels, normal parathyroid hormone levels, and skeletal abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Vitamin D dependent rickets\"}"
