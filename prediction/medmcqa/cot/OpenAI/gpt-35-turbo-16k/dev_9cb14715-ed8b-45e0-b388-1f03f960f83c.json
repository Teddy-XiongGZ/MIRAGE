    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In facial porcelain inlay, the goal is to create a restoration that blends seamlessly with the natural teeth. To achieve this, the facial surface of the inlay should be designed in a way that it mimics the natural tooth anatomy and contours. A. Facial surface should be perpendicular to cavity margins: This option is not correct because if the facial surface is perpendicular to the cavity margins, it would result in a restoration that does not blend well with the natural tooth. The restoration would appear flat and unnatural. B. Facial surface should converge to cavity margins: This option is also not correct because if the facial surface converges to the cavity margins, it would result in a restoration that is too thin at the margins. This can lead to weak margins and increased risk of fracture. C. Facial surface should be parallel to cavity margins: This option is the correct choice. When designing a facial porcelain inlay, the facial surface should be parallel to the cavity margins. This allows for a restoration that blends well with the natural tooth and maintains proper thickness at the margins. D. Axial wall is 2.5 mm deeper than normal: This option is not related to the design of the facial surface in a porcelain inlay and is therefore not correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
