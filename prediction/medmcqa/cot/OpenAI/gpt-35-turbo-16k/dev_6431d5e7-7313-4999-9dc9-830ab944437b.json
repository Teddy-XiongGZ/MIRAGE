    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The asseion states that the distal pole of the scaphoid goes to avascular necrosis after a scaphoid fracture. The reason given is that the blood supply of the scaphoid is from distal to proximal. To determine the accuracy of the asseion and reason, we need to evaluate the blood supply of the scaphoid and its relationship to avascular necrosis. The scaphoid bone receives its blood supply from branches of the radial artery, which enter the bone at the distal pole and travel proximally. This means that the blood supply of the scaphoid is indeed from distal to proximal. Additionally, scaphoid fractures can disrupt the blood supply to the bone, leading to avascular necrosis. Therefore, both the asseion and reason are true, and the reason explains the asseion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Both asseion and reason are true and reason explains asseion\"}"
