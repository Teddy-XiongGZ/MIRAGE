    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the anatomy of mandibular molars. Mandibular molars typically have two roots, a mesial root and a distal root. Each root can have one or more canals. In some cases, there may be an additional accessory canal that arises from the coronal 1/3rd of the tooth. The question asks for the percentage of mandibular molars that have a single accessory canal arising from the coronal 1/3rd. Based on the information provided, we do not have any specific data or research mentioned. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage. The answer is D. None of the above, as we do not have enough information to provide a definitive percentage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
