    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which drug does not affect DNA synthesis, we need to consider the mechanism of action of each drug. Rifampicin is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis, not DNA synthesis. Linezolid is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, not DNA synthesis. Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic that damages bacterial DNA, affecting DNA synthesis. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that damages bacterial DNA, affecting DNA synthesis. Therefore, the drug that does not affect DNA synthesis is Rifampicin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
