    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nutrients are mainly absorbed in the small intestine. The small intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption in the digestive system. It is lined with specialized cells called enterocytes that have microvilli, which increase the surface area for absorption. These enterocytes absorb nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. The large intestine primarily absorbs water and electrolytes, not nutrients. The liver is involved in the metabolism and storage of nutrients, but it is not the main site of absorption. The stomach primarily breaks down food through the process of digestion, but it does not absorb nutrients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
