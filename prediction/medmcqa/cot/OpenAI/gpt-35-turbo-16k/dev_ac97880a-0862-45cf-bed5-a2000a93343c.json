    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The treatment of choice for stage I cancer larynx depends on several factors such as the location and size of the tumor, as well as the overall health of the patient. In general, stage I cancer is considered early-stage and localized, which means it has not spread beyond the larynx. The main treatment options for stage I cancer larynx include surgery, radiotherapy, and sometimes chemotherapy. Radical surgery, such as a total laryngectomy, may be considered for larger tumors or if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Chemotherapy is typically used in combination with other treatments for more advanced stages of laryngeal cancer. Radiotherapy, which uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells, is often the primary treatment for stage I cancer larynx. It can be delivered externally or internally (brachytherapy).
