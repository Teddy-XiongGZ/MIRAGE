    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the tensile strength of GIC after 24 hours, we need to consider the setting process of GIC. Generally, GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) undergoes an initial setting reaction followed by a final setting reaction. The initial setting reaction occurs within the first few minutes, where the material starts to harden. The final setting reaction takes place over a longer period, usually 24 hours, during which the material continues to gain strength. Considering this, after 24 hours of setting, the tensile strength of GIC is expected to be greater than the initial setting strength but may not reach its maximum potential. Therefore, the answer is B. Greater than Znpo4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
