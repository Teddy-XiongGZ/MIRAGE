    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Blast injuries are caused by the rapid release of energy from an explosion. They can cause a variety of injuries, including abrasions, bruises, puncture lacerations, and fractures. To determine which finding is not specific to blast injury, we need to consider the characteristics of each finding. \\n\\nAbrasions are superficial injuries caused by friction or scraping of the skin. They can occur in blast injuries due to contact with debris or the ground. \\n\\nBruises, also known as contusions, are caused by blunt force trauma that damages blood vessels beneath the skin. They can occur in blast injuries when the body is struck by flying objects or when it impacts a solid surface. \\n\\nPuncture lacerations are deep, penetrating injuries caused by sharp objects. While blast injuries can cause puncture lacerations if the individual is struck by shrapnel or other sharp objects, this finding is not specific to blast injury as it can occur in other types of trauma as well. \\n\\nFractures are breaks or cracks in bones. Blast injuries can cause fractures due to the direct impact of the explosion or from the force of being thrown against a solid object. \\n\\nBased on this information, the finding that is not specific to blast injury is puncture laceration (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
