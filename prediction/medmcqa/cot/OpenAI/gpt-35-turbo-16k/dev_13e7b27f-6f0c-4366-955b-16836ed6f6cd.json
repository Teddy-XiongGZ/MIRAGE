    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anticoagulant is used for electrolyte estimation, we need to consider the properties of each anticoagulant and its effect on electrolyte levels. \\n\\nA. EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is commonly used as an anticoagulant for blood samples. However, it does not affect electrolyte levels and is not used specifically for electrolyte estimation. \\n\\nB. Citrate is another anticoagulant commonly used for blood samples. It is used for coagulation studies and does not affect electrolyte levels. \\n\\nC. Sodium fluoride is primarily used as a preservative for glucose estimation and does not affect electrolyte levels. \\n\\nD. Lithium heparin is an anticoagulant commonly used for blood samples. It does not affect electrolyte levels and is not used specifically for electrolyte estimation. \\n\\nBased on this information, none of the options listed (A, B, C, D) are used for electrolyte estimation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
