    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the mechanical objectives of cleaning and shaping, we need to consider the contributions of different researchers in the field. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Schilder: Schilder is known for his contributions to endodontics, but his work primarily focused on the concept of root canal therapy and the importance of cleaning and shaping the root canal system. While he emphasized the importance of cleaning and shaping, he did not specifically outline the mechanical objectives.\\n\\nB. Wein: Wein is not a well-known researcher in the field of endodontics, and there is no evidence to suggest that he has provided specific mechanical objectives for cleaning and shaping.\\n\\nC. Brook: Brook is not a recognized researcher in the field of endodontics, and there is no evidence to suggest that he has provided specific mechanical objectives for cleaning and shaping.\\n\\nD. Grossman: Grossman is a renowned researcher in the field of endodontics and has made significant contributions to the understanding of cleaning and shaping. He outlined the mechanical objectives of cleaning and shaping, including the removal of debris, bacteria, and organic tissue, as well as the creation of a tapered shape to facilitate obturation. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Grossman.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
