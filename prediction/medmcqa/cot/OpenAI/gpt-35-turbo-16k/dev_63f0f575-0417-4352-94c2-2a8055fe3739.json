    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High copper silver alloy is known to have certain advantages compared to conventional alloy. Let's evaluate each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. It has increased tensile and compressive strength: This statement is true. High copper silver alloy has been found to have increased strength compared to conventional alloy.\\n\\nB. It has poor tarnish and corrosion resistance: This statement is also true. High copper silver alloy is known to have poor tarnish and corrosion resistance.\\n\\nC. Its' edge strength is greater: This statement is true. High copper silver alloy has been found to have greater edge strength compared to conventional alloy.\\n\\nD. Mercury content in the final restoration is less: This statement is not true. High copper silver alloy does not have any direct relation to the mercury content in the final restoration. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
