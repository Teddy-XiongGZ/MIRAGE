Option A, hydroxylation of proline and lysine, is not directly related to coagulation. Option B, carboxylation of glutamic acid, is involved in the activation of coagulation factors. Option C, carboxylation of coagulation factors, is a crucial step in their activation. Option D, platelet aggregation defect, is less likely to cause the specific presentation described. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Carboxylation of coagulation factors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
