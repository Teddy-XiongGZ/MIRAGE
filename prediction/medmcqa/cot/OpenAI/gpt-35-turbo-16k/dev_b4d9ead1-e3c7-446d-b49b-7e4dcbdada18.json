    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Golgi tendon organs are sensory receptors located in the tendons of skeletal muscles. They are responsible for detecting changes in muscle tension. When muscle tension increases, the Golgi tendon organs are activated and send signals to the central nervous system to inhibit muscle contraction. This is a protective mechanism to prevent excessive force on the muscle and potential injury. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Muscle tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
