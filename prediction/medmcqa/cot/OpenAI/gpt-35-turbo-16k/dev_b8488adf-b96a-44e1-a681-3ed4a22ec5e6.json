    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibroblasts are cells that are responsible for producing collagen, which is the main structural protein in the body. There are different types of collagen, including Type I, Type II, and Type III. Type I collagen is the most abundant and is found in various tissues, including the skin, tendons, and bones. Type II collagen is primarily found in cartilage, while Type III collagen is found in connective tissues.
