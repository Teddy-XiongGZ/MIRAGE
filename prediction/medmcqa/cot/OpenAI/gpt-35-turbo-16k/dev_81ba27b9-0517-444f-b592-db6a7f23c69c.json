    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, causing a change in the enzyme's conformation and reducing its activity. This means that the inhibitor does not compete with the substrate for binding to the active site. In the case of acetazolamide, it inhibits carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to carbonic acid. By inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, acetazolamide reduces the production of aqueous humor in the eye, which helps to lower intraocular pressure in angle closure glaucoma. Since acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor, it does not directly affect the Vmax (maximum rate of reaction) of the enzyme. However, it does affect the Km (Michaelis constant), which is a measure of the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. Non-competitive inhibitors typically increase the Km value, indicating a decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. Therefore, the effect of acetazolamide on the carbonic anhydrase enzyme is an increase in Km.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Increase in both Km and Vmax\"}"
