    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the new marker for mantle cell lymphoma, we need to consider the characteristics of Cyclin DI negative cases. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. SOX 11: SOX 11 is a transcription factor that is commonly overexpressed in mantle cell lymphoma, including Cyclin DI negative cases. It is a known marker for mantle cell lymphoma.\\n\\nB. Annexin V: Annexin V is not specifically associated with mantle cell lymphoma or Cyclin DI negative cases.\\n\\nC. MYD88: MYD88 is a signaling protein that is commonly mutated in lymphomas, including some cases of mantle cell lymphoma. However, it is not specifically associated with Cyclin DI negative cases.\\n\\nD. ITRA I: There is no known association between ITRA I and mantle cell lymphoma or Cyclin DI negative cases.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the most appropriate answer is A. SOX 11.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
