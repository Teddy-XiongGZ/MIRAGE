    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a local anesthetic is administered, it blocks the transmission of nerve signals in the area where it is applied. The different types of nerve fibers transmit different sensations. Proprioception is the sense of the position and movement of our body parts, and it is primarily carried by large myelinated fibers. Pain is carried by small unmyelinated fibers. Touch is carried by both large and small fibers. Temperature is carried by small fibers. Since local anesthetics primarily block small fibers, the first sensation to be lost following administration of local anesthetic is pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
