    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones. It can either stimulate or inhibit the release of these hormones. To determine which anterior pituitary hormone is primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus, we need to consider the function of each hormone and its regulation. A. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is responsible for stimulating the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormones. It is primarily regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus, which stimulates its release. Therefore, TSH is not primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. B. GRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) is responsible for stimulating the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. GRH is primarily under stimulatory control of the hypothalamus, so it is not the correct answer. C. Somatostatin is a hormone that inhibits the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary. It is primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. Therefore, somatostatin is the correct answer. D. Prolactin is responsible for stimulating milk production in the mammary glands. Its release is primarily regulated by prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), also known as dopamine, from the hypothalamus. Therefore, prolactin is not primarily under inhibitory control of the hypothalamus. Based on the above reasoning, the correct answer is C. Somatostatin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
