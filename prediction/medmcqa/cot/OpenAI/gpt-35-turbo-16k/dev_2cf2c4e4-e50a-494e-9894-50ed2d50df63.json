    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The strength of association between a risk factor and a disease is typically measured by the odds ratio or relative risk. The odds ratio compares the odds of the disease occurring in the exposed group to the odds of the disease occurring in the unexposed group. The relative risk, on the other hand, compares the risk of the disease in the exposed group to the risk of the disease in the unexposed group. Both measures provide an indication of the strength of the association between the risk factor and the disease. Attributable risk measures the proportion of disease cases that can be attributed to the risk factor, while the absolute risk of the variable refers to the overall risk of the disease in the population. P-value, on the other hand, is a statistical measure that assesses the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Odds ratio/Relative risk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
