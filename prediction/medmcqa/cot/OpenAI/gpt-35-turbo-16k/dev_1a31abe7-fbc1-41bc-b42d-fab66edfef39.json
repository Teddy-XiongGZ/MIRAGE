    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cholesterol is a type of lipid that is essential for various physiological functions in the body. It is transported in the bloodstream in the form of lipoproteins. VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and chylomicrons are all types of lipoproteins that carry cholesterol. VLDL is responsible for transporting triglycerides from the liver to the peripheral tissues. LDL is commonly known as 'bad cholesterol' as it carries cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues, including the arterial walls. HDL is known as 'good cholesterol' as it helps remove excess cholesterol from the peripheral tissues and transports it back to the liver for excretion. Chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary triglycerides from the intestines to the peripheral tissues. Considering the role of cholesterol in plasma, the most important career of cholesterol would be the lipoprotein that carries cholesterol from the peripheral tissues back to the liver for excretion. Therefore, the correct answer is C. HDL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
