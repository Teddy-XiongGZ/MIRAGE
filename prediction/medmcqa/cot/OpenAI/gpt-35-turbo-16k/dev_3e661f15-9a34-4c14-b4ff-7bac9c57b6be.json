    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After successfully treating a urinary tract infection in a 2-year-old female, the next step in management should be to investigate the underlying cause of the infection and prevent future recurrences. Since urinary tract infections in young children can be associated with structural abnormalities, it is important to evaluate the urinary tract. The first step in this evaluation is usually an ultrasound, which can help identify any anatomical abnormalities or obstructions. However, in some cases, an ultrasound alone may not provide enough information. In such cases, a DMSA scan may be recommended. A DMSA scan is a nuclear medicine test that can assess the function and scarring of the kidneys. Additionally, it is important to monitor for any recurrent infections, so regular culture sensitivity tests should be performed. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Ultrasound + DMSA scan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
