    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best surgery to relieve intractable vertigo in a Meniere's disease patient is typically a Vestibular neurectomy. This procedure involves cutting the vestibular nerve, which is responsible for transmitting balance signals from the inner ear to the brain. By severing this nerve, the patient's vertigo symptoms can be significantly reduced or eliminated. Surgical Labyrinthectomy involves removing the entire inner ear, which is a more invasive procedure and is typically reserved for cases where other treatments have failed. Endolymphatic sac decompression is a less invasive procedure that involves creating a small hole in the endolymphatic sac to improve fluid drainage, but it is not as effective as a vestibular neurectomy for relieving vertigo. Cochleosacculotomy is a surgical procedure that is primarily used to treat Meniere's disease-related hearing loss, rather than vertigo symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Vestibular neurectomy\"}"
