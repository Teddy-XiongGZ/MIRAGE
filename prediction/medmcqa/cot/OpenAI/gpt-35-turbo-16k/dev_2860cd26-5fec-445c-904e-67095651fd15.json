    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Standardization is a statistical method used to compare two or more populations by adjusting for differences in their composition. It allows for a fair comparison between populations by removing the effect of confounding variables. A. This statement is true. Standardization allows for comparison to be made between two different populations by adjusting for differences in their composition. B. This statement is false. The national population is not always taken as the standard population. The standard population can be any population that is chosen as a reference for comparison. C. This statement is true. For direct standardization, age-specific rates of the study population are applied to that of the standard population. This allows for a comparison of rates between populations with different age distributions. D. This statement is false. For indirect standardization, age-specific rates of the standard population are applied to the study population. This is done to estimate the expected number of cases or rates in the study population based on the age-specific rates of the standard population. Based on the above explanations, the answer choice is B. The national population is always taken as the standard population.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
