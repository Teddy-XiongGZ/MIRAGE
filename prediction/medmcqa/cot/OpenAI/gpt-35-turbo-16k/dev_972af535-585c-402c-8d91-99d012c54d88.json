    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this question, we are asked about the means by which one part of R.P.D opposes the action of the retainer in the function. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Tripoding: Tripoding refers to the stability of a denture base by resting on three points. It is not related to opposing the action of the retainer.\\n\\nB. Reciprocation: Reciprocation is a principle in removable partial denture design where one component of the denture resists the forces generated by the retainer. This seems to be a possible answer.\\n\\nC. Retention: Retention refers to the ability of a denture to resist displacement along the path of insertion. It is not directly related to opposing the action of the retainer.\\n\\nD. Stress breaking: Stress breaking refers to the design of a removable partial denture to distribute occlusal forces and minimize stress on the abutment teeth. It is not directly related to opposing the action of the retainer.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. Reciprocation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
