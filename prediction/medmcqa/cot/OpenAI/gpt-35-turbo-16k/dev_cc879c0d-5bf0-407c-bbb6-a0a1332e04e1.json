    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation and comminuted fracture, the primary goals of treatment are to stabilize the fracture, promote healing, and prevent infection. A. 'Bag of bones' and IMF (intermaxillary fixation) is a treatment option commonly used for mandibular fractures. However, in the case of a high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation and comminuted fracture, this treatment option may not provide adequate stability and support for the fractured bone fragments. B. Reconstruction plates and closure of the fracture may be a viable treatment option for stable fractures with minimal comminution. However, in the case of a high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation and comminuted fracture, this treatment option may not provide sufficient stability and support for the fractured bone fragments. C. Immediate reconstruction and grafting may be a suitable treatment option for high velocity gunshot injuries with periosteal denudation and comminuted fractures. This approach involves reconstructing the fractured bone using plates, screws, or other fixation devices, and grafting bone or tissue to promote healing and restore the integrity of the bone. D. Initially debridement is done, then load bearing reconstruction plates, and grafting in a secondary procedure may be a reasonable treatment option for high velocity gunshot injuries with periosteal denudation and comminuted fractures. This approach involves removing any damaged or contaminated tissue, stabilizing the fracture with load-bearing reconstruction plates, and performing grafting in a secondary procedure to promote healing and restore the integrity of the bone. Considering the severity of the injury and the need for immediate stabilization and reconstruction, the most appropriate treatment option for a high velocity gunshot injury with periosteal denudation and comminuted fracture would be C. Immediate reconstruction and grafting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
