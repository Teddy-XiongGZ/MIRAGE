    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which heart disease has the highest maternal mortality during pregnancy, we need to consider the complications and risks associated with each condition. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Coarctation of aorta: This condition involves narrowing of the aorta, which can lead to high blood pressure and heart strain. While it can cause complications during pregnancy, it is not typically associated with high maternal mortality rates.\\n\\nB. Eisenmenger syndrome: This is a condition where a congenital heart defect leads to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension. Eisenmenger syndrome is known to have a high risk of maternal mortality during pregnancy due to the strain on the heart and lungs.\\n\\nC. AS (Aortic stenosis): This condition involves narrowing of the aortic valve, which can lead to reduced blood flow from the heart. While it can cause complications during pregnancy, it is not typically associated with high maternal mortality rates.\\n\\nD. MS (Mitral stenosis): This condition involves narrowing of the mitral valve, which can lead to reduced blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. While it can cause complications during pregnancy, it is not typically associated with high maternal mortality rates.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the heart disease with the highest maternal mortality during pregnancy is Eisenmenger syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
