    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oxygenases are enzymes that incorporate oxygen atoms into organic substrates. They play a crucial role in various biological processes, including the hydroxylation of steroids and the carboxylation of drugs. Therefore, options C and D are true regarding oxygenases. Now, let's consider the options A and B. Oxygenases can incorporate either 1 or 2 atoms of oxygen into the substrate. So, both options A and B can be true regarding oxygenases. However, the question asks for the option that is NOT true regarding oxygenases. Therefore, the correct answer is option B, which states that oxygenases incorporate 1 atom of oxygen. This is incorrect because oxygenases can incorporate either 1 or 2 atoms of oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
