    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the false statement regarding sensory endings, we need to evaluate each statement and determine if it is true or false. Let's analyze each statement one by one:\\n\\nA. Annulospiral wrap the ends: This statement is true. Annulospiral endings are specialized sensory nerve endings that wrap around the muscle spindle fibers.\\n\\nB. Primary ending is annulospiral: This statement is true. The primary ending of a muscle spindle is indeed annulospiral.\\n\\nC. Primary ending conduct 1a fibers: This statement is true. The primary endings of muscle spindles conduct 1a fibers, which are large, myelinated fibers responsible for proprioception.\\n\\nD. Flower spray is secondary: This statement is false. Flower spray endings are actually primary sensory endings found in muscle spindles. They are named 'flower spray' due to their branching pattern.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the false statement regarding sensory endings is D. Flower spray is secondary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
