    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Direct impact on the bone can result in different types of fractures depending on the direction and force of the impact. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Transverse fracture: This type of fracture occurs when the bone breaks horizontally, perpendicular to its long axis. It is usually caused by a direct blow or trauma. \\n\\nB. Oblique fracture: This type of fracture occurs when the bone breaks diagonally. It is also commonly caused by a direct blow or trauma.\\n\\nC. Spiral fracture: This type of fracture occurs when the bone breaks in a twisting or spiraling pattern. It is often caused by a rotational force applied to the bone.\\n\\nD. Comminuted fracture: This type of fracture occurs when the bone breaks into multiple fragments. It can be caused by a direct impact or high-energy trauma.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the most likely answer is C. Spiral fracture, as direct impact combined with a twisting or spiraling force can result in this type of fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
