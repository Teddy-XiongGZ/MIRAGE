    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gastric glands are located in the stomach and are responsible for producing gastric juice. Chief cells are a type of cell found within gastric glands. To determine where chief cells are located, we need to understand the structure of a gastric gland. A gastric gland consists of three main parts: the neck, the isthmus, and the base (also known as the fundus). The neck is the uppermost part of the gland, followed by the isthmus, and then the base or fundus. The gastric pit is a depression on the surface of the stomach that leads into the gastric gland. Based on this information, chief cells are located within the base or fundus of a gastric gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
