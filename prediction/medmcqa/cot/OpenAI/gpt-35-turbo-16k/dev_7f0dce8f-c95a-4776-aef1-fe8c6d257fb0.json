    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The palatine process refers to the formation of the hard palate, which is the bony structure that forms the roof of the mouth. The development of the palatine process begins during embryonic development. The fusion of the palatine processes starts at a specific time during fetal development. To determine when this fusion occurs, we need to consider the timeline of fetal development. Fertilization typically occurs around the 2nd week of pregnancy. By the 6th week of fertilization, the embryo is in the early stages of development, and the palatine process has already started to form. By the 8th week of fertilization, the embryo has further developed, and the fusion of the palatine processes is likely to have begun. By the 10th and 12th weeks of fertilization, the fusion of the palatine processes is expected to be more advanced. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 8th week of fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
