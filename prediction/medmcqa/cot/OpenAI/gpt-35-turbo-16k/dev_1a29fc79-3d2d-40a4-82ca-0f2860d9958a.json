    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a patient with Hepatitis B infection, the markers that are typically increased are those that indicate active infection or exposure to the virus. HbsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is a marker of active infection and is typically increased in patients with Hepatitis B. HbcAg (Hepatitis B core antigen) is not typically increased in Hepatitis B infection, as it is an intracellular antigen and is not present in the blood. Anti HbsAg IgG (antibodies against Hepatitis B surface antigen) is typically increased in patients who have recovered from Hepatitis B or have been vaccinated against it. Anti HbcAg IgG (antibodies against Hepatitis B core antigen) is typically increased in patients with previous or ongoing Hepatitis B infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
