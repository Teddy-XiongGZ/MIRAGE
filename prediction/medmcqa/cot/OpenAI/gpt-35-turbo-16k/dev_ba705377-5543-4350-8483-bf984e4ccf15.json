    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Xerostomia is a condition characterized by dry mouth due to reduced salivary flow. Saliva plays an important role in maintaining the pH balance in the mouth. Normally, the salivary pH is slightly acidic, ranging from 6.2 to 7.4. In xerostomia, the salivary flow is reduced, which can lead to a decrease in buffering capacity and a shift towards a more acidic pH. Therefore, the salivary pH in xerostomia is expected to be low.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Low\"}"
