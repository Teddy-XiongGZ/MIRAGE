    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anti D prophylaxis is administered to prevent Rh(D) alloimmunization in Rh(D) negative women who are exposed to Rh(D) positive fetal blood. Rh(D) alloimmunization can occur during pregnancy or after certain procedures that can cause fetal-maternal hemorrhage, such as MTP (medical termination of pregnancy) at 63 days, amniocentesis at 16 weeks, and intra-uterine transfusion at 28 weeks. Manual removal of placenta, on the other hand, does not involve direct exposure to fetal blood and therefore does not require anti D prophylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
