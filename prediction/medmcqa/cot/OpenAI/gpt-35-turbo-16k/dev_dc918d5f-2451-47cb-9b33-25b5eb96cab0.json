    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cardiac pain may be transmitted to the jaw due to the phenomenon known as referred pain. Referred pain occurs when pain originating from one area of the body is felt in another area. In the case of cardiac pain, it can be referred to the jaw due to the overlapping of nerve pathways. To determine which nerves are involved, we need to consider the innervation of the heart and the jaw. The heart is innervated by the sympathetic nerves that arise from the first thoracic nerve. The jaw is innervated by the trigeminal nerve (5th cranial nerve) and the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve). Therefore, the correct answer should include the first thoracic nerve, the trigeminal nerve, and either the second or third cervical nerve, depending on the choice.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
