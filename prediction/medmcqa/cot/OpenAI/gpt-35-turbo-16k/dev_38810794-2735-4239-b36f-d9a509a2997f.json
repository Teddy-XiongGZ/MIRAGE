    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"According to the WHO definition of hearing loss, there are different categories based on the severity of the loss. The categories are mild, moderate, severe, and profound. To determine the value for profound hearing loss, we need to look at the dB (decibel) range. The dB range for profound hearing loss is typically the highest among the categories. Let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. 61-71 dB: This range falls within the mild to moderate hearing loss category, so it is not the value for profound hearing loss. \\nB. >81 dB: This range is higher than the previous option and falls within the severe hearing loss category. It is still not the value for profound hearing loss. \\nC. >91 dB: This range is higher than the previous options and falls within the profound hearing loss category. It is a potential value for profound hearing loss. \\nD. >101 dB: This range is even higher than the previous options and is not typically used to classify profound hearing loss. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the value to classify as profound hearing loss according to the WHO definition is >91 dB.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
