    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In hemorrhage, the lost plasma is replaced by the body's compensatory mechanisms. The primary mechanism is the movement of fluid from the interstitial space into the blood vessels to restore blood volume. This process is known as fluid shift. The bone marrow is responsible for producing blood cells, not plasma. The kidney filters the blood and regulates fluid balance, but it does not directly replace lost plasma. The spleen is involved in the immune system and the storage and destruction of red blood cells, but it does not replace lost plasma. Muscle tissue does not have the ability to produce plasma. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Bone marrow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
