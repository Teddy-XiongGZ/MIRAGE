    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In occlusion, the teeth come into contact with each other. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Cusp-to-cusp contact: This refers to the contact between the pointed parts of the teeth called cusps. However, not all teeth have cusps, so this option may not be accurate for all teeth.\\n\\nB. Edge-to-edge contact: This refers to the contact between the edges of the teeth. While this can occur in certain situations, it is not the primary form of contact in occlusion.\\n\\nC. Marginal contact: This refers to the contact between the outer edges of the teeth. This is a more accurate description of the contact that occurs in occlusion.\\n\\nD. Surface-to-surface contact: This refers to the contact between the entire surface of the teeth. While this can occur in certain situations, it is not the primary form of contact in occlusion.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate option is C. Marginal contact.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
