    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels, we need to calculate the z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile. The z-score can be calculated using the formula: z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where x is the value we want to find, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. In this case, we want to find the value of x. Rearranging the formula, we have x = z * \u03c3 + \u03bc. To find the z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile is approximately -1.645. Substituting the values into the formula, we have x = -1.645 * 2 + 10.6 = 7.31. Therefore, the minimum haemoglobin level below which 5% of the pregnant females will have their haemoglobin levels is approximately 7.31 g/dL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
