    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Overload of denture base refers to excessive pressure or force exerted on the denture base. This can occur due to various factors. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Small bases: Small bases would not necessarily cause overload, as long as they adequately cover the edentulous areas and distribute the forces evenly.\\n\\nB. Too large bases: If the denture bases are too large, they may extend beyond the edentulous areas and cause excessive pressure on the surrounding tissues, leading to overload.\\n\\nC. Small teeth: The size of the teeth does not directly contribute to overload of the denture base. It may affect the esthetics and function, but not the overload.\\n\\nD. Large teeth: Similar to small teeth, the size of the teeth does not directly cause overload of the denture base.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Too large bases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
