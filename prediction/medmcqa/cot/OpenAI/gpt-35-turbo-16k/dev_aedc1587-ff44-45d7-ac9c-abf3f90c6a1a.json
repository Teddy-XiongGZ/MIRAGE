    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a condition where there is a defect or opening in the bony covering of the superior semicircular canal in the inner ear. This can lead to various characteristic features. A. Third window phenomenon: In SSCD, the presence of a third window in the inner ear is a characteristic feature. This means that there are now three openings or windows in the inner ear, which can lead to abnormal sound transmission and symptoms like autophony (hearing one's own voice or bodily sounds louder than normal). B. SNHL (Sensorineural hearing loss): SSCD can cause hearing loss, specifically a conductive component due to the abnormal sound transmission through the third window. This can result in a mixed hearing loss, with both conductive and sensorineural components. C. Tullio's phenomenon: Tullio's phenomenon refers to the presence of vertigo or dizziness induced by loud sounds or pressure changes. In SSCD, the abnormal sound transmission through the third window can lead to Tullio's phenomenon. D. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) is a useful investigation in SSCD. VEMP testing can help assess the function of the vestibular system and can be abnormal in patients with SSCD. Based on the above information, all of the given options (A, B, C, and D) are characteristic features of superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
