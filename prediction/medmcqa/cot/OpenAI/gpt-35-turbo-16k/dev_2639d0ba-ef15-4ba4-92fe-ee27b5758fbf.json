    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SABE prophylaxis refers to the use of antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis in certain high-risk individuals. MR (mitral regurgitation), ASD (atrial septal defect), and MS (mitral stenosis) are all conditions that can increase the risk of infective endocarditis and therefore require SABE prophylaxis. CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) is a surgical procedure to bypass blocked coronary arteries and does not directly increase the risk of infective endocarditis. Therefore, the condition that does not require SABE prophylaxis is D. CABG.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
