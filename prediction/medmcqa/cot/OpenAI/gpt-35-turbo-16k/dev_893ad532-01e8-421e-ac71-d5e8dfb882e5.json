    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in various organs, primarily the liver and brain. It typically presents in childhood or adolescence. To determine which is not a feature of Wilson's disease in a child, we need to understand the common clinical manifestations of the condition. \\n\\nA. Fanconi syndrome is not typically associated with Wilson's disease. Fanconi syndrome is a kidney disorder that affects the proximal tubules and leads to the loss of important substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes in the urine. It is not directly related to copper accumulation in Wilson's disease.\\n\\nB. Sensory changes can occur in Wilson's disease, particularly in the form of peripheral neuropathy. This can cause numbness, tingling, and other abnormal sensations in the extremities.\\n\\nC. Hemolytic anemia can occur in Wilson's disease due to the destruction of red blood cells. This is a result of copper accumulation in the liver, which impairs the liver's ability to produce certain proteins necessary for red blood cell function.\\n\\nD. Chronic active hepatitis is a common feature of Wilson's disease. Copper accumulation in the liver leads to inflammation and damage, resulting in chronic hepatitis.\\n\\nBased on this information, the answer is A. Fanconi syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
