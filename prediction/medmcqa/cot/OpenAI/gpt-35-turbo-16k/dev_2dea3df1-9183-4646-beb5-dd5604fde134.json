    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Oral tuberculosis is a form of tuberculosis that affects the oral cavity. It is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. When considering the lesions of oral tuberculosis, we need to identify the characteristic features associated with it. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Central caseation: Caseation necrosis is a type of necrosis that is commonly seen in tuberculosis. It is characterized by the formation of a cheesy, friable material in the center of the lesion. This is a characteristic feature of tuberculosis lesions.\\n\\nB. Hyaline degeneration: Hyaline degeneration refers to the accumulation of a homogenous, glassy material within the tissues. This is not typically associated with tuberculosis lesions.\\n\\nC. Giant cells in the center: Giant cells, specifically Langhans giant cells, are a characteristic feature of tuberculosis. They are multinucleated cells that are formed by the fusion of macrophages. They are commonly seen in the center of tuberculosis lesions.\\n\\nD. Presence of epithelioid cells: Epithelioid cells are another characteristic feature of tuberculosis. They are large, polygonal cells that have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. They are commonly seen in tuberculosis lesions.\\n\\nBased on the above information, it can be concluded that the correct answer is B. Hyaline degeneration, as it is not associated with lesions of oral tuberculosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
