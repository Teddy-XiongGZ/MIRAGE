    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystinuria is a genetic disorder that affects the transport of the amino acid cystine in the kidneys. Let's go through the options one by one to determine the correct answer. \\n\\nA. Generalised aminoaciduria: Cystinuria specifically affects the transport of cystine, not all amino acids. \\n\\nB. Systemic acidosis: Cystinuria does not directly cause systemic acidosis. \\n\\nC. Deposition of cystine crystals in Renal tubular cells: This is a characteristic feature of cystinuria. The inability to properly transport cystine leads to its accumulation and subsequent formation of cystine crystals in the renal tubular cells. \\n\\nD. Recurrent urinary caliculi: Cystinuria predisposes individuals to the formation of cystine stones in the urinary tract, leading to recurrent urinary caliculi. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is C. Deposition of cystine crystals in Renal tubular cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
