The examiner is unable to insinuate fingers between the mass and the pelvic bone. This information suggests that the mass is likely to be an ovarian cyst. Ovarian cysts are common in young girls and can present as cystic masses in the lower abdomen. They can be mobile and may involve the umbilical and hypogastrium regions.
