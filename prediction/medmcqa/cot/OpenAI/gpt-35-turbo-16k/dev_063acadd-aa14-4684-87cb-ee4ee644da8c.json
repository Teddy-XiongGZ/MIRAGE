    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent testicular ischemia and necrosis. The patient in this case is a 10-year-old boy with severe pain in the right scrotum that has not been relieved for the past 1 hour. Testicular torsion is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The appropriate surgical intervention for testicular torsion is immediate scrotal exploration of the affected side. This is done to detorse the testicle and restore blood flow. Operating on the opposite side is not necessary unless there are symptoms or signs of torsion on that side as well. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Immediate scrotal exploration of the affected side and operate opposite side if symptomatic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
