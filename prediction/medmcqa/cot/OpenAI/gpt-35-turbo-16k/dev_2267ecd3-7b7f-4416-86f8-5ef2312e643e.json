    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child presents with high grade fever, inspiratory stridor, and swallowing difficulty with drooling of saliva. These symptoms are suggestive of acute epiglottitis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. The mainstay of treatment for acute epiglottitis is securing the airway. Therefore, the first step in management would be to ensure the child's airway is protected. This can be done by providing supplemental oxygen and maintaining the child in a position of comfort. Once the airway is secured, the next step would be to administer appropriate antibiotics to cover the likely causative organisms. The most common causative organism for acute epiglottitis is Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Therefore, IV ceftriaxone, which covers Hib, would be the recommended treatment choice in this scenario. Nebulized racemic epinephrine is not indicated in the management of acute epiglottitis. Anti-diphtheria toxin is not indicated unless there is a suspicion of diphtheria infection. Corticosteroids may be considered as an adjunctive treatment to reduce airway inflammation, but the priority in this case is securing the airway and administering appropriate antibiotics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. IV ceftriaxone\"}"
