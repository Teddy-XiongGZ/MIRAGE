    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the given information, the patient is presenting with symptoms of pilonidal sinus, which is a condition characterized by pain, swelling, and discharge at the base of the spine. The presence of fever and repeated abscesses that have burst spontaneously further supports the diagnosis. Pilonidal sinus is commonly seen in individuals with occupations that involve prolonged sitting or friction in the sacrococcygeal region, such as jeep drivers. Surgical intervention is often required to treat pilonidal sinus. Flap-based procedures are commonly used for pilonidal sinus surgery as they help in closing the wound and promoting healing. Now, let's evaluate the options provided: \\n\\nA. Rhomboid flap: This is a commonly used flap for pilonidal sinus surgery. It involves creating a rhomboid-shaped flap of skin and tissue from the surrounding area to cover the wound.\\nB. Circular flap: This is not a commonly used flap for pilonidal sinus surgery.\\nC. Free flap: Free flaps involve transferring tissue from one part of the body to another using microsurgery. This is not typically used for pilonidal sinus surgery.\\nD. Rotational flap: This is another commonly used flap for pilonidal sinus surgery. It involves rotating adjacent tissue to cover the wound. \\n\\nBased on the information provided, the most appropriate flap-based procedure for pilonidal sinus surgery would be either the rhomboid flap or the rotational flap.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
