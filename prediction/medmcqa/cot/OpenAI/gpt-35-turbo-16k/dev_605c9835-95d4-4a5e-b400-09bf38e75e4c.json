This symptom is suggestive of myoclonus, which is a sudden, brief, involuntary muscle jerk. The fact that the symptom is precipitated during the morning and during exams suggests that it may be stress-related. The patient also has a family history of epilepsy, as her cousin sister has been diagnosed with epilepsy. The EEG findings of epileptic spikes further support the diagnosis of epilepsy.
