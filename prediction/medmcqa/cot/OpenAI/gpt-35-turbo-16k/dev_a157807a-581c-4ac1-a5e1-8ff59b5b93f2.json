    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To remove centric interference, we need to identify the areas where the interference is occurring and then make adjustments accordingly. Centric interference refers to the interference that occurs when the teeth come together in centric occlusion. In this case, the question is asking how to reduce centric interference. The supporting cusps are the cusps on the buccal and lingual surfaces of the posterior teeth that provide support and stability during occlusion. If these cusps are causing interference, reducing their height or adjusting their occlusal surfaces can help to remove the interference. The central fossa is the depression in the occlusal surface of the posterior teeth. If the central fossa is causing interference, it can be adjusted by reducing its depth or modifying its shape. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Both of the above, as reducing the height or adjusting the occlusal surfaces of the supporting cusps and modifying the central fossa can help to remove centric interference.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
