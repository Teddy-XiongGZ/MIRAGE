    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A square knot is a type of knot that is commonly used in various applications, including surgery. To determine the composition of a square knot, we need to understand the basic structure of the knot. Step 1: A square knot is formed by joining two ends of a rope or suture material together. Step 2: The knot is created by making two loops with the ends of the rope or suture material. Step 3: The loops are then thrown in a specific direction to form the knot. Step 4: The loops can be thrown in either the same direction or in opposite directions. Based on the options provided, the correct answer is C. Two single loops thrown in the same direction. This is because a square knot is formed by throwing two single loops in the same direction and then interlocking them to create a secure knot.\" \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
