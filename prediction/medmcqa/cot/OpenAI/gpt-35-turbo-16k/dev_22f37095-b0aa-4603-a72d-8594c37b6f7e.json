    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process that shows phases of acute inflammation is necrosis. Acute inflammation is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of injury or infection. Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs as a result of injury or infection, and it triggers an inflammatory response. Apoptosis, on the other hand, is a programmed cell death that does not typically elicit an inflammatory response. Pyroptosis and necroptosis are forms of cell death that are associated with inflammation, but they are not specifically linked to the phases of acute inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
