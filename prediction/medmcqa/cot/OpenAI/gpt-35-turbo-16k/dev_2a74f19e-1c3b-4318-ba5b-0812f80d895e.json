    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Randomization in a clinical trial is a process of assigning participants to different treatment groups in a random manner. It is an important method to ensure the validity and reliability of the trial results. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Randomization reduces confounding by distributing potential confounding factors equally among the treatment groups. This helps to minimize the influence of confounding variables on the treatment effect.\\n\\nB. Randomization decreases selection bias by ensuring that the assignment of participants to treatment groups is not influenced by any factors that may introduce bias.\\n\\nC. Randomization ensures comparability of two groups by distributing both known and unknown confounding factors equally among the treatment groups. This helps to create similar baseline characteristics between the groups, which is important for valid comparisons.\\n\\nD. Randomization does not directly increase the external validity of the trial. External validity refers to the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population. While randomization can help to minimize bias and increase internal validity, external validity depends on factors such as the representativeness of the study population and the study design.\\n\\nBased on the above explanations, the option that is not true about randomization in a clinical trial is D. Increases external validity of the trial.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
