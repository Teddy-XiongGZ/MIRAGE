    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine at what stage of embryonic development initial tooth development begins, we need to understand the timeline of tooth development. Tooth development begins during the embryonic stage of development. The first stage of tooth development is called the bud stage, where the tooth bud forms. This is followed by the cap stage, where the tooth bud grows and takes on a cap-like shape. Finally, the bell stage occurs, where the tooth bud differentiates into the different components of a tooth. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and D, as they occur too early in the embryonic development process. Between options B and C, the 6th week and 8th week, the tooth bud formation and growth occur during the 6th week. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 6th week.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
