    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Radio density refers to the darkness or blackness of an image on a radiograph. It is influenced by several factors. Decreasing the milliampere-seconds (MA) setting will decrease the amount of radiation reaching the image receptor, resulting in decreased radio density. Decreasing the kilovolt peak (kVp) setting will also decrease the amount of radiation reaching the image receptor, resulting in decreased radio density. Decreasing the target film distance will increase the divergence of the x-ray beam, resulting in decreased radio density. Increasing the target film distance will decrease the divergence of the x-ray beam, resulting in increased radio density.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
