    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Guiding planes are used in dentistry to provide a path of insertion and removal for removable partial dentures. They help in guiding the denture into place and maintaining its stability during function. The purpose of guiding planes is to prevent unwanted movement of the denture during mastication. With this in mind, we can eliminate options C and D, as they are not directly related to the function of guiding planes. Option A, 'For better clasp prediction,' does not accurately describe the purpose of guiding planes. Therefore, the correct answer is option B, 'Vertical to occlusal plane,' as guiding planes are typically oriented in a vertical direction relative to the occlusal plane to provide the desired path of insertion and removal for the denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
