    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The marathon runner is experiencing pain in the anteromedial tibia, which is the front and inner side of the shin. The fact that the pain occurs during regular walking/jogging for long hours suggests an overuse injury. Since the X-ray is normal, it indicates that there is no obvious fracture. However, the doctor orders a bone scan, which is a more sensitive imaging test to detect subtle bone abnormalities. Based on these findings, the most probable diagnosis would be shin splints, which is a common overuse injury of the shin bone (tibia) and surrounding tissues. Shin splints often present with pain along the inner side of the shin during exercise. Therefore, the answer choice is B. Shin splint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
