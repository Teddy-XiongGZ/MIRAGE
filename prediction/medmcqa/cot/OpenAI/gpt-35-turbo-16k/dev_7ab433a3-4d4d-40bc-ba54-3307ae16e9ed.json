    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Occlusal adjustment refers to the process of modifying the occlusion, or the way the upper and lower teeth come together. It is done to achieve proper alignment and balance of the teeth during biting and chewing. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one does not affect occlusal adjustment: A. Compensating curve: The compensating curve is a curve on the occlusal surface of the teeth that helps distribute the forces evenly during biting and chewing. It plays a role in occlusal adjustment. B. Cusp height: Cusp height refers to the height of the cusps, which are the pointed or rounded parts of the teeth. The cusp height affects the occlusal contact and can be adjusted during occlusal adjustment. C. Incisal guidance: Incisal guidance refers to the way the upper and lower front teeth guide the jaw during movements. It is an important factor in occlusal adjustment. D. Postural position: Postural position refers to the position of the jaw and the rest of the body. While it may have an impact on overall oral health, it is not directly related to occlusal adjustment. Based on the above analysis, the option that does not affect occlusal adjustment is D. Postural position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
