    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thumb sucking can have various effects on the oral cavity. It can lead to a localized anterior open bite, where the front teeth do not meet properly when the jaws are closed. This is because the constant pressure from thumb sucking can push the front teeth forward and create a gap between the upper and lower front teeth. Thumb sucking can also contribute to an increase in overjet, which is the horizontal distance between the upper and lower front teeth. This occurs when the thumb exerts pressure on the upper front teeth, causing them to protrude forward. Additionally, thumb sucking can result in a constricted maxilla, which is the upper jaw. The constant pressure from thumb sucking can cause the upper jaw to narrow, leading to a narrower dental arch and crowded teeth. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
