    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ratio of upper anterior facial height to lower anterior facial height can be determined by comparing the measurements of these two regions. Upper anterior facial height refers to the distance between the nasion (the midpoint between the eyes) and the subnasale (the base of the nose), while lower anterior facial height refers to the distance between the subnasale and the menton (the lowest point on the chin). To calculate the ratio, we need to divide the measurement of the upper anterior facial height by the measurement of the lower anterior facial height. Let's calculate the ratio for each option and determine the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
