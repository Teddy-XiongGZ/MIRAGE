    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) is a condition characterized by high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can lead to complications such as preeclampsia and eclampsia. In this case, the patient has PIH with a blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg at 32 weeks of gestation. The goal of management is to control the blood pressure and prevent complications. The timing of delivery depends on the severity of the hypertension and the presence of other complications. In this case, since there are no other complications mentioned, the pregnancy can be allowed to continue until a gestational age where the risk of complications outweighs the benefits of continuing the pregnancy. The general guideline for termination of pregnancy in cases of PIH without complications is around 37 to 40 completed weeks. Therefore, the answer choice would be B. 37 completed weeks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
