    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resolving power of a microscope refers to its ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects as separate entities. To determine the resolving power, several factors need to be considered. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Size of the aperture: The aperture size affects the amount of light entering the microscope but does not directly impact the resolving power.\\n\\nB. Focal length of the eyepiece: The focal length of the eyepiece determines the magnification of the microscope but does not directly affect the resolving power.\\n\\nC. Thickness of the film: The thickness of the film is not a relevant factor in determining the resolving power of a microscope.\\n\\nD. Wavelength of light source used: The resolving power of a microscope is directly related to the wavelength of the light used. Smaller wavelengths provide better resolution. Therefore, the wavelength of the light source used is the factor that does not affect the resolving power of a microscope.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Wavelength of light source used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
