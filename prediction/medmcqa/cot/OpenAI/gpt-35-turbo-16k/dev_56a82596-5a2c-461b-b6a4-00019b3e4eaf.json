    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In complete bilateral palsy of recurrent laryngeal nerves, both the left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves are affected. The recurrent laryngeal nerves innervate the muscles responsible for vocal cord movement. When both nerves are paralyzed, the vocal cords are unable to move, resulting in a loss of speech. Additionally, the vocal cords play a crucial role in maintaining the airway during breathing. In the absence of vocal cord movement, there is a risk of airway obstruction, leading to stridor (a high-pitched sound during breathing) and dyspnea (difficulty in breathing). Therefore, the correct answer is A. Complete loss of speech with stridor and dyspnea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
