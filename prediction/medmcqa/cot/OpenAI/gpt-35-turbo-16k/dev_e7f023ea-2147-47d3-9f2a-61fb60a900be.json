    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fibrinolytic therapy is a treatment that involves the use of drugs to dissolve blood clots. An antidote is a substance that can counteract the effects of a particular drug. To determine the antidote for fibrinolytic therapy, we need to consider the mechanism of action of the drugs listed. Option A, Epsilon aminocaproic acid, is not an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy. Option B, Protamine, is an antidote for heparin, not fibrinolytic therapy. Option C, Heparin, is not an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy. Option D, Streptokinase, is a fibrinolytic agent itself and is not an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, none of the options listed are an antidote for fibrinolytic therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
