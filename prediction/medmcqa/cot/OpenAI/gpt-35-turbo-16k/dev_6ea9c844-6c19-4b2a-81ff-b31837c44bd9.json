    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome is a condition characterized by the kidneys' inability to filter waste and excess fluid from the blood. It is often caused by genetic defects. To determine the most common gene defect in this syndrome, we need to consider the known genetic mutations associated with it. A. ACE (Angiotensin-converting enzyme) is not a gene defect associated with idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. It is involved in regulating blood pressure. B. NPHS2 (Nephrin) is a gene defect that has been identified as a cause of idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. Mutations in the NPHS2 gene can lead to abnormal functioning of the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidneys. C. HOX11 (Homeobox protein Hox-11) is not a gene defect associated with idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. It is involved in embryonic development. D. PAX (Paired box gene) is a family of genes involved in various developmental processes, but it is not specifically associated with idiopathic steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. NPHS2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
