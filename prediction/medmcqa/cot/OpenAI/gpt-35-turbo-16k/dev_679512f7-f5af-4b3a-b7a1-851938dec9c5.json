    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent cross-infection with a sensor in digital radiography/RVG, we need to consider the most effective method of disinfection or barrier protection. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Cover with autoclaved cloth with each use: Autoclaving cloth may not effectively disinfect the sensor and may not provide a sufficient barrier against cross-infection.\\n\\nB. Wipe with ethyl alcohol in each patient: Wiping with ethyl alcohol can help disinfect the sensor, but it may not provide a complete barrier against cross-infection.\\n\\nC. Clean with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite in each patient: Cleaning with sodium hypochlorite can effectively disinfect the sensor, but it may not provide a complete barrier against cross-infection.\\n\\nD. Cover with impervious barrier: Covering the sensor with an impervious barrier can provide both effective disinfection and a barrier against cross-infection. This is the most appropriate option to prevent cross-infection with a sensor in digital radiography/RVG.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is D. Cover with impervious barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
