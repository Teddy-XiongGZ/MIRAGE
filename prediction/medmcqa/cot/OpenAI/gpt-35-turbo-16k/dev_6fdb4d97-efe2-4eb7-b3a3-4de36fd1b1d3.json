    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is determined by the balance between the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries and the opposing forces that resist filtration. The afferent arteriole supplies blood to the glomerulus, while the efferent arteriole carries blood away from the glomerulus. Afferent arteriolar resistance can affect the GFR by altering the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries. Similarly, efferent arteriolar resistance can also impact the GFR. Aerial pressure, on the other hand, does not directly determine the GFR. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
