    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the likely hormone X, we need to consider the localization of its receptor. If the receptor of hormone X is found in the nucleus, it suggests that hormone X is likely a steroid hormone. Steroid hormones are lipophilic and can diffuse across the cell membrane to bind to intracellular receptors in the nucleus. Among the given options, adrenaline, insulin, and FSH are not steroid hormones. Thyroxine, on the other hand, is a thyroid hormone and is known to bind to nuclear receptors. Therefore, the likely hormone X is Thyroxine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
