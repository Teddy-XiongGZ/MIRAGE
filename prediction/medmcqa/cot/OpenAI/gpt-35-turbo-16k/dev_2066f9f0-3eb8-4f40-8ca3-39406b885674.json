    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lateral pharyngeal space is a potential space located on the side of the pharynx. It is connected to several other spaces in the head and neck region. To determine which space is not directly connected to the lateral pharyngeal space, we need to consider the anatomical relationships. A. Buccal space: The buccal space is located in the cheek region and is not directly connected to the lateral pharyngeal space. B. Sublingual space: The sublingual space is located beneath the tongue and is not directly connected to the lateral pharyngeal space. C. Submandibular space: The submandibular space is located beneath the mandible (jawbone) and is not directly connected to the lateral pharyngeal space. D. Retropharyngeal space: The retropharyngeal space is located behind the pharynx and is directly connected to the lateral pharyngeal space. Based on the anatomical relationships, the correct answer is D. Retropharyngeal space, as it is not directly connected to the lateral pharyngeal space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
