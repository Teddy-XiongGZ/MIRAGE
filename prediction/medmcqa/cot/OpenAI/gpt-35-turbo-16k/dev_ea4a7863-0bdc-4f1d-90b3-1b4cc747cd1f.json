    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Proteoglycans are a type of glycoprotein that consist of a core protein with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached. GAGs are long, unbranched polysaccharides that contain repeating disaccharide units. These GAG chains contain negatively charged sulfate or carboxyl groups, which give proteoglycans their high negative charge. This negative charge causes the GAG chains to radiate out from the protein, creating a brush-like structure. Therefore, the correct statement is that proteoglycans consist of a core protein with GAG chains attached and the negative charges cause them to radiate out from the protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
