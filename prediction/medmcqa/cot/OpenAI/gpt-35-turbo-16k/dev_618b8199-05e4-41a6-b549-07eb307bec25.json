    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with persistent productive cough and clubbing, which are suggestive of a chronic respiratory condition. On auscultation, wheeze and crackles are present, indicating airway obstruction and lung inflammation. To confirm the diagnosis, the most specific investigation would be helpful. A chest X-ray is a commonly used initial investigation for respiratory conditions, but it may not provide enough detail to confirm the diagnosis. MRI is not typically used as a first-line investigation for respiratory conditions. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is an invasive procedure that may be useful for obtaining samples from the lower respiratory tract, but it is not the most specific investigation for confirming the diagnosis. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a specialized imaging technique that provides detailed images of the lungs and is particularly useful for evaluating lung parenchyma and airway abnormalities. Therefore, the most specific investigation to confirm the diagnosis in this case would be HRCT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
