    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RNA-based techniques involve the use of RNA molecules in the process. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a technique used to amplify DNA, not RNA.\\n\\nB. Sanger's technique, also known as Sanger sequencing, is a DNA sequencing method that does not directly involve RNA.\\n\\nC. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput DNA sequencing technique that can also be used to sequence RNA. Therefore, it is based on RNA.\\n\\nD. Western blot is a technique used to detect specific proteins, not RNA.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Next generation sequencing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
