    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Slow wave potentials are rhythmic oscillations of the resting membrane potential in the smooth muscle cells of the gastrointestinal tract. These slow waves are responsible for initiating contractions in the intestine. The slow wave potential originates from a specialized group of cells called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs). These cells act as pacemakers and generate the electrical activity that leads to the slow wave potentials. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Interstitial cells of Cajal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
