    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When saliva passes from salivary gland to duct orifices, it undergoes ion exchanges. The salivary glands actively transport ions such as sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and chloride into the saliva. This process results in the saliva having a different composition compared to plasma. To determine the tonicity of saliva, we need to consider the concentration of solutes in the saliva compared to plasma. If the concentration of solutes in saliva is higher than that in plasma, it would be hypertonic. If the concentration is lower, it would be hypotonic. If the concentration is the same, it would be isotonic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Hypertonic sometimes\"}"
