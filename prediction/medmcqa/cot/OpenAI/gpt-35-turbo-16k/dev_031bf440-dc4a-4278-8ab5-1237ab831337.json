    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement are both types of dental cements. To determine which of the given options is common to both, we need to evaluate each option. \\n\\nA. Polyacrylic acid is liquid: This option is not common to both cements. Zinc oxide eugenol cement uses eugenol as a liquid component, while polycarboxylate cement uses polyacrylic acid as a liquid component.\\n\\nB. Chemical bond to tooth structure: This option is common to both cements. Both zinc oxide eugenol cement and polycarboxylate cement form a chemical bond with the tooth structure.\\n\\nC. Chelation: This option is not common to both cements. Chelation is not a characteristic of zinc oxide eugenol cement or polycarboxylate cement.\\n\\nD. Substitution of eugenol by EBA to increase strength of cement: This option is specific to zinc oxide eugenol cement and not common to both cements. EBA (ethyl benzoyl acetate) is used as a substitute for eugenol in zinc oxide eugenol cement to increase its strength.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the correct answer is B. Chemical bond to tooth structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
