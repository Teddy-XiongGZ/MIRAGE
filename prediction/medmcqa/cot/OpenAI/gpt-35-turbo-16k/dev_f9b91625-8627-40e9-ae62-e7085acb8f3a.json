    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Porcelain denture teeth are commonly used in dentistry as they have several desirable properties. Let's evaluate each option to determine the correct answer. \\n\\nA. The coefficient of thermal expansion refers to how much a material expands or contracts with changes in temperature. Porcelain denture teeth have a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than acrylic teeth, so option A is incorrect. \\n\\nB. Abrasion resistance refers to how well a material can withstand wear and tear. Porcelain denture teeth have a higher abrasion resistance than enamel, so option B is incorrect. \\n\\nC. Inter alveolar clearance refers to the space between the teeth and the surrounding bone. Porcelain denture teeth can be used in cases where the inter alveolar clearance is small, so option C is a possible correct answer. \\n\\nD. Porcelain denture teeth do not have a higher abrasion resistance than gold, so option D is incorrect. \\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the correct answer is C. Should be used where the inter alveolar clearance is small.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
