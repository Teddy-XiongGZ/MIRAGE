    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"True open bite refers to a condition where there is a gap between the upper and lower teeth when the mouth is closed. To determine the cause of true open bite, we need to consider the potential fractures mentioned in the options. \\n\\nA. Horizontal fracture of the maxilla: This fracture involves the upper jaw bone and is unlikely to cause a true open bite. \\nB. Unilateral fracture of mandibular angle: This fracture involves the lower jaw bone, but it is unlikely to cause a true open bite. \\nC. Fracture of the coronoid process of left side of mandible: The coronoid process is a bony projection of the mandible, and a fracture in this area is also unlikely to cause a true open bite. \\nD. Fracture of mandibular symphysis: The mandibular symphysis is the midline area where the two halves of the lower jaw bone meet. A fracture in this area can result in a true open bite as it affects the alignment of the lower jaw. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most likely cause of true open bite among the given options is a fracture of the mandibular symphysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
