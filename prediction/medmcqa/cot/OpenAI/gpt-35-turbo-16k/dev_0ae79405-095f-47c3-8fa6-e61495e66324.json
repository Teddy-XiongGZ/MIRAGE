    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Haem synthesis involves a series of steps in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. One of the key steps in haem synthesis is the conversion of succinyl CoA to delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) by the enzyme ALA synthase. This step occurs in the mitochondria and is the rate-limiting step in haem synthesis. Succinyl CoA is an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Succinyl CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
