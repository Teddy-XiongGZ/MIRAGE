    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the type of embrasure characterized by a slight to moderate recession of interdental papilla, we need to understand the classification of embrasure types. Embrasure types are classified based on the level of interdental papilla recession. Type I embrasure refers to a normal embrasure with no recession. Type II embrasure is characterized by a slight to moderate recession of the interdental papilla. Type III embrasure is characterized by a severe recession of the interdental papilla, with the interdental bone being visible. Type IV embrasure is characterized by complete loss of interdental papilla and interdental bone. Based on this information, the embrasure characterized by a slight to moderate recession of interdental papilla is Type II.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
