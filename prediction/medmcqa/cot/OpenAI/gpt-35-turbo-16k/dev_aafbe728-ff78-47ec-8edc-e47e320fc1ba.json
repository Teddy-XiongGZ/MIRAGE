    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The potential generated due to the movement of freely diffusible ions across a semi-permeable membrane is calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. This equation takes into account the permeability of the membrane to different ions, as well as their concentration gradients. The Nernst equation is used to calculate the equilibrium potential for a single ion, not taking into account the permeability of the membrane. The Gibbs equation is a thermodynamic equation used to calculate the change in free energy of a system. The Fick principle is used to calculate cardiac output based on the measurement of a substance's concentration in the blood and the rate of its clearance from the body.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation\"}"
