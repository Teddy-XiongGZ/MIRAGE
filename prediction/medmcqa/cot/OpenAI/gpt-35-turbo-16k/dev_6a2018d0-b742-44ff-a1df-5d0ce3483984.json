    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the test, we need to use the following formulas: Sensitivity = (True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)) * 100 Specificity = (True Negative / (True Negative + False Positive)) * 100 Given the data: True Positive (Test Positive and Diseased) = 273 False Negative (Test Negative but Diseased) = ? True Negative (Test Negative and Non-diseased) = 595 False Positive (Test Positive but Non-diseased) = ? To calculate the False Negative, we subtract the True Positive from the total number of Diseased: False Negative = Total Diseased - True Positive = 273 + ? = ? To calculate the False Positive, we subtract the True Negative from the total number of Non-diseased: False Positive = Total Non-diseased - True Negative = 595 + ? = ? Now, let's calculate the sensitivity and specificity using the formulas above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
