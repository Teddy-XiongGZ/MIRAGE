    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tooth eruption is a process in which teeth emerge from the gums and become visible in the mouth. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Osteoclastic activity: Osteoclasts are cells responsible for bone resorption. While they play a role in tooth eruption by breaking down bone to create a pathway for the tooth, they are not the primary cause of tooth eruption.\\n\\nB. Proliferation of cells at crypt: The crypt is the space in the jawbone where the tooth develops. The proliferation of cells at the crypt is involved in tooth development, but it is not the direct cause of tooth eruption.\\n\\nC. Exfoliation of primary tooth: Exfoliation refers to the shedding of primary (baby) teeth to make way for permanent teeth. This process is not directly related to tooth eruption.\\n\\nD. Eruptive forces: Eruptive forces, such as the pressure exerted by the developing tooth and the surrounding tissues, are the primary cause of tooth eruption. These forces push the tooth through the gums and into the oral cavity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
