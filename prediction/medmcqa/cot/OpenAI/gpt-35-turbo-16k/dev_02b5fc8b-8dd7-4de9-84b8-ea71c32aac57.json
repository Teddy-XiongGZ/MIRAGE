    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has developed generalized peeling of the skin, which is a characteristic feature of a severe drug reaction. The fact that it occurred one month after taking anti-epileptics suggests a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The absence of involvement of the palms and soles is a key clue that helps narrow down the differential diagnosis. Fixed drug eruption typically presents as well-demarcated erythematous patches or plaques that recur at the same site with each exposure to the offending drug. Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disorder that typically involves the mucous membranes and can cause skin peeling, but it does not spare the palms and soles. Steven Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are both severe drug reactions that can cause widespread skin peeling, but they typically involve the palms and soles. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is A. Fixed drug eruption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
