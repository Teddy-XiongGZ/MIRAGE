    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The flow rate of a fluid through a pipe is directly proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the pipe. This relationship is known as Poiseuille's law. If the radius of the blood vessels is increased by 50%, we can calculate the increase in flow rate by raising the ratio of the new radius to the original radius to the fourth power. Let's calculate the increase in flow rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
