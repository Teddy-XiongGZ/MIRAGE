    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells, we need to consider the characteristics and functions of each potential choice. \\n\\nA. Elastin: Elastin is a protein that provides elasticity to tissues. It is not specifically associated with limbal epithelial stem cells.\\n\\nB. Keratin: Keratin is a protein that forms the structural framework of epithelial cells. While it is commonly found in epithelial tissues, it is not a universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells.\\n\\nC. Collagen: Collagen is a protein that provides structural support to various tissues. It is not specifically associated with limbal epithelial stem cells.\\n\\nD. ABCG2: ABCG2, also known as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), is a transporter protein that plays a role in drug resistance. It has been identified as a universal marker of limbal epithelial stem cells. ABCG2 is involved in protecting stem cells from toxic substances and maintaining their stemness.\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is D. ABCG2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
