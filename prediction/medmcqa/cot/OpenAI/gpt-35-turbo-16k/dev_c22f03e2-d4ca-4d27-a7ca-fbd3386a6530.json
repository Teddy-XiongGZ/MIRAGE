    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dental amalgam is a mixture of metals used to fill cavities in teeth. It typically consists of a combination of silver, tin, copper, and mercury. The percentage of mercury by weight in dental amalgam can vary depending on the specific formulation. However, it is generally accepted that modern dental amalgam contains a lower percentage of mercury compared to older formulations. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and B, which have higher percentages of mercury. Option C, 25-35% hg by wt., is also unlikely as it is still relatively high. Therefore, the most likely answer is option D, 15-25% hg by wt.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
