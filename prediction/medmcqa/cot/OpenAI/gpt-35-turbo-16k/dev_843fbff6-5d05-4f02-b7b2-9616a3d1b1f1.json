    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temperature of the body is controlled by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a region of the diencephalon, which is located in the brain. It plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature by receiving information from temperature receptors in the skin and internal organs. The hypothalamus then sends signals to various parts of the body to initiate responses that help maintain a stable body temperature. The medulla and precentral gyrus are not directly involved in temperature regulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hypothalamus\"}"
