    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gram positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell wall. To target this cell wall, we need a drug that can inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan. Among the given options, Gentamycin and Ciprofloxacin do not act on the cell wall. Tetracycline primarily acts on the ribosomes and protein synthesis, so it is not the correct choice either. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that specifically targets the synthesis of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of gram positive bacteria. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Vancomycin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
