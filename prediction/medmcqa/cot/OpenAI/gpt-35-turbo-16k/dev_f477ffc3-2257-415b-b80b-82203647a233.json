    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The central groove in the Mandibular 2nd premolar refers to the groove that runs vertically down the center of the tooth. To determine the shape of this groove, we need to consider the anatomy of the tooth. The Mandibular 2nd premolar typically has two cusps, a buccal cusp and a lingual cusp. The central groove separates these cusps. A. Y shaped: This shape implies that the central groove splits into three branches, resembling the letter Y. However, this is not a characteristic feature of the Mandibular 2nd premolar. B. H shaped: This shape implies that the central groove splits into two branches, resembling the letter H. Again, this is not a characteristic feature of the Mandibular 2nd premolar. C. U shaped: This shape implies that the central groove does not split into branches and instead forms a single continuous curve, resembling the letter U. This is the most common shape of the central groove in the Mandibular 2nd premolar. D. All of the above: Since both A and B are incorrect, the correct answer is C. Therefore, the central groove in the Mandibular 2nd premolar is U shaped.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
