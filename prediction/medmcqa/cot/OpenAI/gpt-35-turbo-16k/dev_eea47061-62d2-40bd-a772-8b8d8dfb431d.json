    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When two screening tests are done in series, the goal is to increase the overall accuracy of the screening process. The first test is usually a sensitive test, which means it has a high probability of correctly identifying individuals with the condition (true positives). However, it may also have a high rate of false positives, meaning it may incorrectly identify individuals without the condition as positive. The second test is usually a specific test, which means it has a high probability of correctly identifying individuals without the condition (true negatives). However, it may also have a high rate of false negatives, meaning it may incorrectly identify individuals with the condition as negative. The combination of these two tests aims to increase both sensitivity and specificity, which means correctly identifying both individuals with and without the condition. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased sensitivity and increased specificity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
