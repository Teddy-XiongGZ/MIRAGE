    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tricuspid atresia is a congenital heart defect where the tricuspid valve, which separates the right atrium and right ventricle, is completely closed or absent. This leads to several characteristic features. A. Left Axis deviation: Tricuspid atresia does not cause left axis deviation. Left axis deviation is typically seen in conditions such as left anterior fascicular block or left bundle branch block. B. Right ventricular hypoplasia: Tricuspid atresia is associated with right ventricular hypoplasia, which means that the right ventricle is underdeveloped. C. Pulmonary vascularity is diminished: Tricuspid atresia is associated with decreased pulmonary blood flow, which can lead to diminished pulmonary vascularity. D. Splitting of S2: Splitting of S2 refers to the splitting of the second heart sound, which is caused by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Tricuspid atresia does not directly affect the closure of these valves, so splitting of S2 can still occur. Based on this information, the characteristic feature of Tricuspid Atresia that is not seen is Left Axis deviation. Therefore, the answer is A. Left Axis deviation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
