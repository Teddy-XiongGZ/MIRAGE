    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Active tissue engineering involves the use of living cells and biomaterials to create functional tissues. The goal is to promote tissue regeneration and repair. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Antigens fibroblasts: Antigens are substances that can trigger an immune response. Fibroblasts are cells that produce the extracellular matrix and play a role in wound healing. It is possible that antigens could be used in tissue engineering to stimulate an immune response and promote tissue regeneration. Therefore, this option could be included in active tissue engineering.\\n\\nB. Bilayered cell therapy: Bilayered cell therapy involves the use of two layers of cells to promote tissue regeneration. This technique is commonly used in wound healing and tissue repair. Therefore, this option could be included in active tissue engineering.\\n\\nC. Enamel matrix derivative: Enamel matrix derivative is a substance derived from the enamel of teeth. It has been used in periodontal regeneration to promote the regrowth of periodontal tissues. Therefore, this option could be included in active tissue engineering.\\n\\nD. Acellular dermal matrix: Acellular dermal matrix is a biomaterial derived from human or animal tissues that has been processed to remove cells. It is commonly used in tissue engineering to provide a scaffold for cell growth and tissue regeneration. Therefore, this option could be included in active tissue engineering.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, it seems that all of the options could be included in active tissue engineering. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
