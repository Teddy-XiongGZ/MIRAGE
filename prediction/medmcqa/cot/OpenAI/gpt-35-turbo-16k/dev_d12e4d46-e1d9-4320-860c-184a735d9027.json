    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The optic chiasm is the point where the optic nerves from each eye cross over. Interruption of the optic chiasm can result in visual field defects. Bitemporal hemianopia is a visual field defect where there is loss of vision in the outer (temporal) half of the visual field in both eyes. Binasal hemianopia is a visual field defect where there is loss of vision in the inner (nasal) half of the visual field in both eyes. Homonymous hemianopia is a visual field defect where there is loss of vision in the same half of the visual field in both eyes. Since the optic chiasm is involved in the crossing over of optic nerves, interruption of the optic chiasm will lead to bitemporal hemianopia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
