Poikilocytosis refers to the presence of abnormally shaped red blood cells, which is not directly measured by RDW. Hypochromia refers to the level of reduced hemoglobin content in red blood cells, which is not directly measured by RDW. Anisochromia refers to the presence of red blood cells with unequal color intensity, which is not directly measured by RDW.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
