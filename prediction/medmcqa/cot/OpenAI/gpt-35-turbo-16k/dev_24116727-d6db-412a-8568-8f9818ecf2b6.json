    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a permanent first molar is lost, the adjacent teeth can shift or drift into the empty space. In this case, the permanent second molar would be the adjacent tooth to the missing first molar. The direction of drift depends on the forces acting on the tooth. In general, when a tooth is lost, the adjacent teeth tend to drift towards the empty space. In the case of a permanent second molar, it would most likely drift towards the mesial side, which is towards the midline of the mouth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Mesial side\"}"
