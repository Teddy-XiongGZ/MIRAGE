    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the neonatal mortality rate, we need to divide the number of neonatal deaths by the total number of live births. The formula is: Neonatal Mortality Rate = (Number of Neonatal Deaths / Total Number of Live Births) * 1000. Given that the number of neonatal deaths is 450 and the total number of live births is 12,450, we can calculate the neonatal mortality rate as follows: (450 / 12,450) * 1000 = 36.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
