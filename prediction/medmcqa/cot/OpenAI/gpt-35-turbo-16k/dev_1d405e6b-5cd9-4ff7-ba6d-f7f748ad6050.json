    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that describes the extent to which a drug is distributed throughout the body. A low apparent volume of distribution indicates that the drug is not extensively distributed to tissues. This means that the drug is primarily confined to the blood plasma and has limited distribution into tissues. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Drug is not extensively distributed to tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
