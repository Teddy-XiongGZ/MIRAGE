    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RNAi stands for RNA interference, which is a biological process that inhibits gene expression. It does so by degrading or preventing the translation of specific mRNA molecules. This means that RNAi reduces the amount of protein produced from a particular gene. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Knock down, as RNAi reduces the expression of the gene rather than completely eliminating it (knock out) or increasing it (knock up).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
