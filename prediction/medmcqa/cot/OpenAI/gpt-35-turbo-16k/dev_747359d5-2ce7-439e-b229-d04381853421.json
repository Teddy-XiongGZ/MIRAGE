    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the likely acid-base imbalance, we need to analyze the pH and pCO2 values. A pH of 7.3 indicates acidemia, which means the blood is more acidic than normal. A pCO2 value of 35 mm Hg falls within the normal range (35-45 mm Hg), indicating that the respiratory component is not the primary cause of the acid-base imbalance. Therefore, we can conclude that the likely acid-base imbalance is metabolic acidosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Metabolic acidosis\"}"
