    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To reduce the chances of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR), several processing steps can be taken. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Irradiation: Irradiation is primarily used to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) and is not directly related to reducing FNHTR.\\n\\nB. Washing: Washing the blood can help remove any residual plasma proteins or antibodies that may trigger an immune response, but it is not specifically targeted at reducing FNHTR.\\n\\nC. Leucocyte reduction: FNHTR is often caused by cytokines released from white blood cells during storage. Leucocyte reduction, which involves removing or reducing the number of white blood cells in the blood product, has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of FNHTR.\\n\\nD. Glycolisation: Glycolisation is not a standard processing step in blood transfusion and is not directly related to reducing FNHTR.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the most appropriate processing step to reduce the chances of FNHTR is C. Leucocyte reduction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
