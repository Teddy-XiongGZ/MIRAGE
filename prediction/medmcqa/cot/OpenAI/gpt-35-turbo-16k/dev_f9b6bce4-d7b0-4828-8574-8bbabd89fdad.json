    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's evaluate each statement one by one: A. Ankle brachial index (ABI) is a measure of the ratio of blood pressure in the ankle to that in the arm. An ABI < 0.5 is indicative of severe peripheral arterial disease and is associated with critical limb ischemia. This statement is true. B. The ankle-brachial index can indeed be different at rest compared to during exercise. During exercise, there is increased demand for blood flow to the muscles, which can lead to a decrease in the ankle-brachial index. This statement is true. C. L-arginine is an amino acid that is often used as a dietary supplement. It is known to promote endothelium-dependent vasodilation by increasing nitric oxide production. However, it does not provide endothelium-independent vasorelaxation. This statement is false. D. Smoking is a well-established risk factor for peripheral vascular disease. It is associated with a greater risk of peripheral vascular disease compared to coronary vascular disease. This statement is true. Based on the above analysis, the statement that is not true is C. L-arginine is not useful for providing endothelium-independent vasorelaxation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
