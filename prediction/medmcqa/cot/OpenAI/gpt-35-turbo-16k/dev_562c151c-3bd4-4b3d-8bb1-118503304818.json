    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Endodontically treated posterior teeth are more susceptible to fracture than untreated ones because of several factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Loss of moisture: Endodontically treated teeth are typically dehydrated during the root canal treatment process, which can lead to a loss of moisture. However, this alone does not significantly increase the risk of fracture.\\n\\nB. Hollow canals: After root canal treatment, the canals within the tooth are cleaned and shaped, resulting in hollow canals. While this can weaken the tooth structure to some extent, it is not the primary reason for increased susceptibility to fracture.\\n\\nC. Loss of coronal structure: This refers to the removal of a significant portion of the tooth's natural structure during the root canal treatment, which weakens the tooth. Loss of coronal structure is a major contributing factor to the increased risk of fracture in endodontically treated posterior teeth.\\n\\nD. All of the above: While options A and B have some impact on the susceptibility to fracture, the primary reason for increased fracture risk in endodontically treated posterior teeth is the loss of coronal structure. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
