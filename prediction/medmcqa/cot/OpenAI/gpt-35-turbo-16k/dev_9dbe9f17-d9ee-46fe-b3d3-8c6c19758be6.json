    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To compare the outcomes of postpartum depression in mothers giving birth to male versus female children, we need to consider the nature of the data and the type of variables involved. The Edinburgh depression scale (EPDS) is a rating scale that measures the severity of depressive symptoms. The EPDS scores are typically treated as continuous variables. Since we are comparing the outcomes between two groups (mothers giving birth to male versus female children), and the EPDS scores are continuous, the appropriate test to use in this scenario is the Student's t-test. The Student's t-test is used to compare the means of two independent groups. It assesses whether there is a statistically significant difference between the mean EPDS scores of mothers giving birth to male versus female children.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Student's t-test\"}"
