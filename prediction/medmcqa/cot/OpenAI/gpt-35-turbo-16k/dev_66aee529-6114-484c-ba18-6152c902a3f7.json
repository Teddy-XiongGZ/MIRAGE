    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"NK cells are a type of immune cells that play a role in the innate immune response. They are able to recognize and kill infected cells. One of the mechanisms by which NK cells recognize infected cells is through the detection of changes in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the cell surface. MHC class I proteins are normally expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells and present peptides derived from intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells. However, viral infections can lead to downregulation or loss of MHC class I expression on infected cells as a mechanism to evade immune recognition. This downregulation of MHC class I proteins makes infected cells more susceptible to recognition and killing by NK cells. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Unable to express MHC class I proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
