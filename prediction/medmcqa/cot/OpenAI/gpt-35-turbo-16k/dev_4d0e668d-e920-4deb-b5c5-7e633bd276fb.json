    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to assess the level of consciousness in a patient. It consists of three components: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response. In this case, the patient is opening his eyes on verbal command, which corresponds to a score of 4 on the eye opening component. The patient is also moving all four limbs spontaneously, which corresponds to a score of 6 on the motor response component. Therefore, the GCS score would be 4 + 6 = 10.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
