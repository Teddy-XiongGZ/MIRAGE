    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Herpes is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can be transmitted through direct contact with the infected area of the skin or mucous membranes. The highest risk of transmission occurs when there are active herpes lesions or sores present. During pregnancy, the risk of transmission to the baby is highest during delivery. This is because the baby can come into direct contact with the virus as it passes through the birth canal. Therefore, the transmission of herpes is maximum during parturition (C). Although transmission can occur at any time during pregnancy, the risk is highest during delivery. Therefore, options A (IInd trimester), B (IIIrd trimester), and D (1st trimester) are not the correct choices for the maximum transmission of herpes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. During parturition\"}"
