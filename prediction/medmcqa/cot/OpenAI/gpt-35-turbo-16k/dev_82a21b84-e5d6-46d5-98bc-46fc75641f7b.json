    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"If a patient with cough is sputum AFB negative but the chest X-ray is suggestive of TB, the next step according to RNTCP (Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program) would be to perform a culture test. Culture is the gold standard for diagnosing tuberculosis and can help identify the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB. This test involves growing the bacteria in a laboratory and can provide a definitive diagnosis. Other tests like line probe assay, nucleic acid amplification test, and tuberculin test may be used for additional information or to confirm the diagnosis, but culture is the recommended next step in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B.
