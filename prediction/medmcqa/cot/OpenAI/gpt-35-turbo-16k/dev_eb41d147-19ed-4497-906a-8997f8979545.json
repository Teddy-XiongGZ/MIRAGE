    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The three embryonic germ layers - ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm - are derived from the process of gastrulation. Gastrulation occurs during early embryonic development and involves the formation of three distinct layers of cells. The process begins with the formation of the primitive streak, which is a thickened region on the surface of the developing embryo. The cells in the epiblast, which is the upper layer of the bilaminar embryonic disc, migrate through the primitive streak and give rise to the three germ layers. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Ectoderm and mesoderm are derived from the epiblast, while the endoderm is derived from the hypoblast.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
