    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a class II cavity on a deciduous molar, the proximal walls refer to the walls that are adjacent to the neighboring tooth. The correct answer can be determined by considering the anatomy and structure of the tooth. Step 1: Enamel rods: Enamel rods are the structural units of enamel that run from the dentin-enamel junction to the outer surface of the tooth. They are arranged in a specific pattern and direction. Step 2: Convergence or divergence: In a class II cavity, the proximal walls are prepared by removing the decayed or damaged tooth structure. The walls are shaped to provide proper retention and resistance form for the restoration. Step 3: Occlusal surface: The occlusal surface refers to the biting surface of the tooth. Based on these considerations, the correct answer is A. Follow directions of enamel rods. The proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar should follow the directions of the enamel rods.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
