    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the capillary oncotic pressure, we need to use the equation: Net Filtration Pressure = (Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure - Capillary Oncotic Pressure) - (Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure - Interstitial Oncotic Pressure). Given that the Net Filtration Pressure is 3 mm Hg, the Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure is 2 mm Hg, the Interstitial Oncotic Pressure is 7 mm Hg, and the Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure is 25 mm Hg, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the Capillary Oncotic Pressure. Rearranging the equation, we get: Capillary Oncotic Pressure = Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure - Net Filtration Pressure + Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure - Interstitial Oncotic Pressure. Plugging in the values, we get: Capillary Oncotic Pressure = 25 mm Hg - 3 mm Hg + 2 mm Hg - 7 mm Hg = 17 mm Hg. Therefore, the capillary oncotic pressure should be 17 mm Hg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
