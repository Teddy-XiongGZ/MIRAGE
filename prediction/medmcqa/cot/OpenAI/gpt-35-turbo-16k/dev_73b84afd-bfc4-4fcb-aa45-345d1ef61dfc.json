    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To reduce non-working side interference, we need to identify which cusps are causing the interference. Non-working side interference occurs when the cusps on the side opposite to the direction of movement during chewing come into contact prematurely. In this case, the cusps on the working side are causing the interference. The working side is the side where the mandible moves towards during chewing. Therefore, to reduce non-working side interference, we need to reduce the cusps on the working side. The cusps on the working side are the maxillary supporting cusps. So, the answer is A. Maxillary supporting cusp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
