    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Keeping in Jack-knife position for long can lead to death due to positional asphyxia. This occurs when the body is in a position that restricts the ability to breathe. In the Jack-knife position, the body is folded in such a way that it can compress the chest and restrict the movement of the diaphragm, making it difficult to breathe. As a result, oxygen supply to the body is reduced, leading to asphyxia. Wedging refers to being trapped or stuck in a narrow space, which is not applicable in this scenario. Burking is a term used to describe a specific method of murder involving suffocation, which is not relevant here. Traumatic asphyxia refers to a condition where there is sudden and severe compression of the chest, leading to asphyxia, but it is not specifically related to the Jack-knife position.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Positional asphyxia\"}"
