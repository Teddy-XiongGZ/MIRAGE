    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Accessory canals are additional canals that branch off from the main root canal system. In the mandibular first molar, there are commonly two main canals - mesial and distal. However, accessory canals can also be present in this tooth. To determine the major pattern of accessory canals in the mandibular first molar, we need to consider the options provided. Option A states that there is a single furcation canal that extends from the pulp chamber to the intra-radicular region. This does not accurately describe the major pattern of accessory canals in the mandibular first molar. Option B suggests that a lateral canal extends from the coronal third to the furcal region, particularly in the distal canal. This is a possible pattern of accessory canals in the mandibular first molar. Option C states that both lateral and furcal canals are present. This is also a possible pattern of accessory canals in the mandibular first molar. Option D suggests that the pattern is variable and age dependent. While this may be true to some extent, it does not specifically describe the major pattern of accessory canals in the mandibular first molar. Based on the options provided, the most accurate answer would be either B or C, as both describe possible patterns of accessory canals in the mandibular first molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/C\"}"
