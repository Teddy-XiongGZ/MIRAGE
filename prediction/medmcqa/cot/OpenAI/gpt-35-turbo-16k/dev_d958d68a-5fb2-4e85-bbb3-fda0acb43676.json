    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The guiding plane is an inclined surface on the abutment tooth that helps in guiding the denture during insertion and removal. It has several functions, but one of them is not related to the guiding plane. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Provide one path of insertion and removal of the restoration: This is a function of the guiding plane. It helps in directing the denture into place and removing it.\\n\\nB. Provide stabilizing characteristics against horizontal rotation of denture: This is also a function of the guiding plane. It helps in preventing the denture from rotating horizontally.\\n\\nC. Eliminate detrimental strain to abutment teeth during placing or removing restoration: This is another function of the guiding plane. It helps in distributing the forces evenly and reducing strain on the abutment teeth.\\n\\nD. Engage the abutment tooth in such a manner as to resist displacement of restoration away from basal seat: This is the correct answer. This function is not related to the guiding plane, but rather to the basal seat, which is the area where the denture rests.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
