    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Net filtration pressure (NFP) is calculated by subtracting the opposing forces from the driving force. The driving force is the difference between the glomerular capillary pressure (PGC) and the Bowman's capsule pressure (pGC). The opposing force is the Bowman's capsule pressure (PBC). Given that PGC = 42 mm Hg, pGC = 12 mm Hg, and PBC = 16 mm Hg, we can calculate NFP as follows: NFP = (PGC - pGC) - PBC = (42 - 12) - 16 = 14 mm Hg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
