    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, we need to calculate the total amount of drug in the 2 ampules. Each ampule contains 200 mg of drug, so 2 ampules will contain a total of 400 mg of drug. Next, we need to calculate the total volume of the drug solution. We are mixing the drug with saline to make a 250 mL solution. Now, we can calculate the concentration of the drug in the solution. The total amount of drug is 400 mg and the total volume of the solution is 250 mL. To calculate the flow rate, we need to convert the dose of the drug from mcg/kg/min to drops/min. The patient weighs 80 kg, so the total dose of the drug is 10 mcg/kg/min x 80 kg = 800 mcg/min. Since 16 drops = 1 mL, we can calculate the flow rate by dividing the dose of the drug (in mcg/min) by the concentration of the drug (in mcg/mL) and then multiplying by 16 to convert from mL to drops. Finally, we can calculate the flow rate by dividing the dose of the drug (in mcg/min) by the concentration of the drug (in mcg/mL) and then multiplying by 16 to convert from mL to drops. Therefore, the flow rate of the drug solution should be 8 drops/min.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 8 drops/min\"}"
