    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a condition caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and is characterized by the growth of benign tumors in the respiratory tract. The mainstay of treatment for this condition is surgical removal of the papillomas. However, topical treatments can also be used to help manage the disease. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication commonly used to treat herpes infections and would not be effective against HPV. Ranitidine is a medication used to reduce stomach acid production and would not be effective in treating recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Zinc is a mineral that is important for immune function, but there is limited evidence to support its use in treating this condition. Cidofovir is an antiviral medication that has been shown to be effective in treating recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. It works by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis and has been used both topically and systemically in the treatment of this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Cidofovir\"}"
