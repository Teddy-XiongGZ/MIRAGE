    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To move the tongue away from the post pharyngeal wall, we need a technique that specifically targets the tongue. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Jaw thrust maneuver: This technique involves lifting the jaw forward to open the airway, but it does not directly address the position of the tongue.\\n\\nB. Triple maneuver: This is not a recognized technique in the context of moving the tongue away from the post pharyngeal wall.\\n\\nC. Head maneuver: This technique involves extending the head to align the airway, but it does not specifically target the tongue.\\n\\nD. Neck maneuver: This is not a recognized technique in the context of moving the tongue away from the post pharyngeal wall.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, it appears that none of the provided options directly address moving the tongue away from the post pharyngeal wall.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
