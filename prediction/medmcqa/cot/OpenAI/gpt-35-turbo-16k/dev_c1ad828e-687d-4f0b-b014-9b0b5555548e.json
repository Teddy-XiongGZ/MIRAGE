    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RVG stands for Radiovisiography, which is a digital imaging system used in dentistry. It is used to capture dental radiographs. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not true about RVG. \\n\\nA. 80% reduction of patient exposure: This statement is true. RVG uses digital sensors that require less radiation exposure compared to traditional film-based radiographs.\\n\\nB. Instant imaging: This statement is true. RVG provides instant imaging, allowing dentists to view the radiographs immediately.\\n\\nC. Easy to storage and retrieval: This statement is true. RVG images are stored digitally, making it easier to store and retrieve compared to physical film-based radiographs.\\n\\nD. Image is sharper than caused by silver halide: This statement is not true. RVG images may not necessarily be sharper than those caused by silver halide. In fact, the image quality can vary depending on various factors such as sensor resolution and image processing algorithms. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
