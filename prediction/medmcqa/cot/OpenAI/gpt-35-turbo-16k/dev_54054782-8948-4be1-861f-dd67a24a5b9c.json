    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Klenow fragment is a truncated form of DNA polymerase I from E. coli. It lacks the 5'-3' exonuclease activity, which is the ability to remove nucleotides from the 5' end of a DNA strand. However, it retains the 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which is the ability to remove nucleotides from the 3' end of a DNA strand. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 3'-5' exonuclease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
