    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms and findings described, this patient is presenting with signs of invasive fungal sinusitis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. The blackish discharge, necrosis of nasal mucosa and facial skin, and fixation of the right globe are all indicative of tissue invasion by a fungal pathogen. The elevated blood sugar and positive urinary ketones suggest that the patient may have uncontrolled diabetes, which is a risk factor for invasive fungal infections. Given the severity of the condition and the need for prompt treatment, the medication of choice in this patient would be Amphotericin B, which is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent with activity against a wide range of fungal pathogens. Itraconazole and ketoconazole are also antifungal agents, but they are not as effective against invasive fungal infections as Amphotericin B. Broad spectrum antibiotics would not be appropriate in this case, as the underlying cause of the symptoms is likely fungal rather than bacterial.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Amphotericin B\"}"
