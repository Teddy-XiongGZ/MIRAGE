    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the interdental papilla protrudes from the rubber dam, it indicates that the rubber dam punch holes are not properly placed. The rubber dam punch holes should be placed between the teeth, and if they are placed too far, it can cause the interdental papilla to protrude.
