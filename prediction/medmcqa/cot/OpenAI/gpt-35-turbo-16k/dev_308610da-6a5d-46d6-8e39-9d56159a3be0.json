    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of glucose in urine can indicate several conditions. First, it is important to understand that glucose is normally reabsorbed by the kidneys and should not be present in urine. If glucose is found in urine, it suggests that the renal threshold for glucose has been exceeded, meaning that the concentration of glucose in the blood is higher than the kidneys can reabsorb.
