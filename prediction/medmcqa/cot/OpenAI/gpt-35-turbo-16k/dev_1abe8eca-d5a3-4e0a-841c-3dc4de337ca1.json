    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The master apical file is an important instrument used in endodontic treatment. Let's go through each option to determine which one is true. \\n\\nA. The last file which is selected for the obturation: This statement is not true. The master apical file is not selected for obturation, but rather for the preparation of the apical portion of the root canal.\\n\\nB. The initial file which is selected for initial radiographic working length: This statement is also not true. The initial file selected for determining the working length is usually a smaller file, not the master apical file.\\n\\nC. The smaller file used in between the other file during biomechanical preparation: This statement is not true either. The master apical file is not a smaller file used in between other files, but rather a specific file used to prepare the apical portion of the root canal.\\n\\nD. The last file which is used for removal of soft debris from root canal: This statement is true. The master apical file is the last file used during the biomechanical preparation of the root canal, and it is used to remove any remaining soft debris from the canal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
