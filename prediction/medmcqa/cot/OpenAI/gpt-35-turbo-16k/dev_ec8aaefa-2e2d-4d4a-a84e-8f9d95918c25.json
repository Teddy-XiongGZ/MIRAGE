    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in this scenario has pre-eclampsia with torsades de pointes and stable vitals. Pre-eclampsia is a condition characterized by high blood pressure and organ damage, and torsades de pointes is a specific type of abnormal heart rhythm. The first step in managing this patient is to stabilize their vitals, which are already stable in this case. The next step would be to address the underlying cause of the torsades de pointes, which in this case is likely the pre-eclampsia.

Therefore, the next best management for this patient would be option B: MgSo4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
