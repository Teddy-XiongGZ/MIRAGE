    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Developing a dental radiograph involves chemically precipitating metallic silver on the exposed film. This is done by using a developer solution, which typically contains sodium thiosulphate. The developer solution reacts with the exposed silver halide crystals on the film, causing them to turn into metallic silver. This forms the image on the radiograph. If the developing time is too long, it can result in an over dark radiograph. Similarly, if high temperatures are used during the developing process, it can also result in a fogged, over dark radiograph. Therefore, the false statement is D. It is incorrect to say that developing a dental radiograph typically involves a developer containing sodium thiosulphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
