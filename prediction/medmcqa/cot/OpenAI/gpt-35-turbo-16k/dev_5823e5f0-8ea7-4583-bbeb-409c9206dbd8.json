    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which drug can decrease the size of the prostate, we need to consider the mechanism of action of each drug. Tamsulosin is an alpha-blocker that relaxes the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow. Sildenafil is a medication used for erectile dysfunction and does not have a direct effect on the size of the prostate. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that reduces the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to prostate enlargement. Prazosin is an alpha-blocker primarily used for the treatment of high blood pressure and does not directly affect the size of the prostate. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Finasteride.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
