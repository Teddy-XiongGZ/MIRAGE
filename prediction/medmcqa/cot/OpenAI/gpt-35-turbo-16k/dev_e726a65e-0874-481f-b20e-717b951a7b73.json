    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Increase in height of mandible with increase in interdental spaces in an elderly man is a characteristic finding of hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism is a condition where there is excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands. PTH plays a crucial role in regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body. In hyperparathyroidism, there is an excess of PTH, which leads to increased bone resorption and release of calcium from the bones. This can result in bone loss and weakening, including the mandible. The increase in interdental spaces is due to the loss of bone density in the mandible, leading to the separation of the teeth. Hyperpituitarism, hyperthyroidism, and hypopituitarism are not associated with an increase in height of the mandible or interdental spaces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Hyperparathyroidism\"}"
