    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Occlusal trauma refers to excessive forces on the teeth during biting and chewing. It can result in various signs and symptoms. Tooth mobility is a common sign of occlusal trauma, as the excessive forces can cause damage to the periodontal ligament and supporting structures, leading to loosening of the tooth. Fractures of cusps can also occur due to the excessive forces, but it is not as common as tooth mobility. Resorption of alveolar ridge and widening of the periodontal ligament are not typically associated with occlusal trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
