    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Following bilateral mandibular fracture in the canine region, the muscles that will tend to pull the mandible back are the ones that attach to the mandible and have a posterior direction of pull. The genioglossus muscle attaches to the mandible and pulls it forward, so it will not contribute to pulling the mandible back. The anterior belly of the digastric muscle attaches to the mandible and pulls it up and forward, so it will also not contribute to pulling the mandible back. The mylohyoid muscle attaches to the mandible and pulls it up, so it will not contribute to pulling the mandible back. The thyrohyoid muscle attaches to the hyoid bone and pulls it up, so it will not contribute to pulling the mandible back. The masseter muscle attaches to the mandible and has a posterior direction of pull, so it will tend to pull the mandible back. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Genioglossus and masseter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
