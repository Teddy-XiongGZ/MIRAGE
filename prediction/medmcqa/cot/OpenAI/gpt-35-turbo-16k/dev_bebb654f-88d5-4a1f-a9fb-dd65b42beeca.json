    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Carrier base gutta percha is a type of dental material used in root canal treatment. The plastic carrier size refers to the size of the carrier that holds the gutta percha material. To determine the material used to make carrier sizes of 40-90, we need to consider the options provided. A. Plastic liquid crystal: Plastic liquid crystal is not commonly used in dental materials, especially for carrier sizes of gutta percha. B. Poly propylene: Polypropylene is a commonly used plastic material in various industries, including dentistry. It is known for its durability and flexibility. It is possible that carrier sizes of 40-90 are made from polypropylene. C. Poly sulphide: Poly sulphide is a type of rubber material that is used in dental impression materials, but it is not typically used in carrier sizes for gutta percha. D. Poly sulphone: Poly sulphone is a high-performance engineering plastic that is used in various industries, including dentistry. It is known for its strength and resistance to chemicals. It is possible that carrier sizes of 40-90 are made from poly sulphone. Based on the options provided, the most likely answer is either B. Poly propylene or D. Poly sulphone. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact material used. Therefore, the answer choice is: B. Poly propylene or D. Poly sulphone.\"}"
