    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of preterm birth in her previous pregnancies, it is important to assess her cervical length to determine if she is at risk for cervical insufficiency. Cervical length can be measured using ultrasound (USG). If the cervical length is found to be short, cervical cerclage may be considered as a management option. Complete bed rest alone is not recommended as it has not been shown to be effective in preventing preterm birth. Abdominal cerclage is typically reserved for cases of recurrent mid-trimester pregnancy loss or failed transvaginal cerclage. Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient would be A. USG to see cervical length.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
