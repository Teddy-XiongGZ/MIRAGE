    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pure left sided failure refers to heart failure that primarily affects the left side of the heart. This can be caused by conditions that increase the workload on the left side of the heart or impair its ability to pump blood effectively. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\na) ASD (Atrial Septal Defect): An ASD is a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of the heart. While it can cause increased blood flow to the right side of the heart, it does not directly affect the left side. Therefore, ASD is unlikely to cause pure left sided failure.\\n\\nb) Aortic Stenosis: Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve, which can obstruct blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. This condition primarily affects the left side of the heart and can lead to left sided heart failure. Therefore, aortic stenosis can cause pure left sided failure.\\n\\nc) Patent Ductus Arteriosus: A patent ductus arteriosus is a persistent opening between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. While it can cause increased blood flow to the lungs, it does not directly affect the left side of the heart. Therefore, patent ductus arteriosus is unlikely to cause pure left sided failure.\\n\\nd) Pulmonary Valvular Obstruction: Pulmonary valvular obstruction refers to a narrowing or blockage of the pulmonary valve, which can obstruct blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. This condition primarily affects the right side of the heart and is unlikely to cause pure left sided failure.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is B. c) Aortic stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
