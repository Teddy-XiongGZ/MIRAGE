    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CSF rhinorrhea refers to the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the nose. It is usually caused by a fracture or injury to the skull base. The immediate treatment of CSF rhinorrhea aims to prevent infection and further complications. Step 1: Antibiotics and observation - Antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent or treat any potential infection that may occur due to the breach in the protective barrier of the skull. However, antibiotics alone are not sufficient for the immediate treatment of CSF rhinorrhea. Step 2: Plugging with paraffin gauge - Plugging the nose with paraffin gauge can help temporarily stop the leakage of CSF. This can be done while awaiting further evaluation and definitive treatment. However, plugging alone is not considered the definitive treatment for CSF rhinorrhea. Step 3: Blowing of nose - Blowing the nose is not recommended in the immediate treatment of CSF rhinorrhea. Blowing the nose can potentially increase the risk of infection and further complications. Step 4: Craniotomy - Craniotomy is a surgical procedure that involves opening the skull to repair the fracture or injury causing the CSF rhinorrhea. It is considered the definitive treatment for CSF rhinorrhea, especially if conservative measures fail. Based on the above steps, the correct answer is D. Craniotomy, as it is the definitive treatment for CSF rhinorrhea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
