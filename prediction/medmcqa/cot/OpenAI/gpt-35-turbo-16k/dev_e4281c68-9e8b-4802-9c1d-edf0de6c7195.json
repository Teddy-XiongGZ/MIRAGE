    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In order to determine which diseases are infectious but not communicable, we need to understand the definitions of these terms. An infectious disease is caused by a pathogen, such as a virus or bacteria, and can be transmitted from one person to another. A communicable disease, on the other hand, is one that can be transmitted from one person to another through direct or indirect contact. Measles, mumps, and scarlet fever are all infectious diseases that can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Tetanus, however, is not communicable as it is caused by a bacterial infection that enters the body through a wound or cut, and cannot be transmitted from person to person. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Tetanus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
