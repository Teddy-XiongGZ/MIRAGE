The treatment for this condition typically involves the use of anticoagulant medications to prevent further clot formation. Among the options provided, low molecular weight heparin is commonly used in the treatment of cancer-associated thromboembolism. This is because low molecular weight heparin has been shown to be effective in preventing and treating blood clots in cancer patients. Anti-thrombin III inhibitors and direct Xa inhibitors are not commonly used in the treatment of cancer-associated thromboembolism.
