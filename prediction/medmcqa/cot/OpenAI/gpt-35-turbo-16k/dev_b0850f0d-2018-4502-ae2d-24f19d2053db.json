    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The deep gingival sheath preparation is a technique used in periodontal surgery to remove the inflamed gingival tissue and create a clean surgical field. The purpose of using a wedge is to retract the gingival tissue and provide access to the underlying structures. The shape of the wedge is important as it affects the effectiveness of tissue retraction. To determine the appropriate shape of the wedge for deep gingival sheath preparation, we need to consider the anatomy of the gingival tissue and the desired outcome. The gingival tissue has a triangular shape, with the apex pointing towards the tooth. Therefore, a triangular wedge would be the most suitable shape to fit into the gingival sulcus and provide effective retraction. A round wedge may not provide enough retraction and may not fit properly into the gingival sulcus. A square wedge may be too bulky and may not provide adequate access to the underlying structures. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is B. Triangular.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
