    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine interstitial fluid volume, we need a method that can accurately measure the volume of fluid in the interstitial space. The interstitial space is the space between cells and is filled with interstitial fluid. Option A, radioactive iodine and radiolabelled water, is not a suitable choice because radioactive iodine is primarily used to measure thyroid function and radiolabelled water is used to measure total body water, not specifically interstitial fluid volume. Option B, radioactive water and radiolabelled albumin, is also not a suitable choice because radioactive water is used to measure total body water, not specifically interstitial fluid volume. Radiolabelled albumin is used to measure plasma volume, not interstitial fluid volume. Option C, radioactive sodium and radioactive water, is a potential choice. Radioactive sodium can be used to measure extracellular fluid volume, which includes both interstitial fluid and plasma volume. By subtracting the plasma volume (measured using radiolabelled albumin) from the extracellular fluid volume, we can estimate the interstitial fluid volume. Option D, radioactive sodium and radioactive labelled albumin, is not a suitable choice because radioactive labelled albumin is used to measure plasma volume, not interstitial fluid volume. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Radioactive sodium and radioactive water.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
