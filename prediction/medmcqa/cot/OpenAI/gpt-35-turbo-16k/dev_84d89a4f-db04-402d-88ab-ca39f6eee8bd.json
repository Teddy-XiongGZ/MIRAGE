    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The respiratory rhythm generation center is responsible for controlling the basic rhythm of breathing. It is located in the brainstem. The dorsal respiratory group (DRG) is a group of neurons located in the medulla oblongata that is involved in the control of inspiration. The pre-Botzinger complex is a group of neurons located in the medulla oblongata that is responsible for generating the basic rhythm of breathing. The ventral respiratory neurons are also located in the medulla oblongata and are involved in the control of expiration. The pneumotaxic center is located in the pons and is involved in the regulation of the rate and depth of breathing. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Pre-Botzinger complex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
