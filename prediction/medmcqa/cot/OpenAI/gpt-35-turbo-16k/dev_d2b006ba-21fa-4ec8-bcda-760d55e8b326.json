    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent sensitivity caused by acid etching and to protect pulp in deep cavities, a liner should be used. The liner should have properties that provide insulation and protection to the pulp. Ca(OH)2 liner is commonly used for this purpose as it has excellent biocompatibility and stimulates dentinogenesis. ZOE (Zinc Oxide Eugenol) is not commonly used as a liner in deep cavities as it has limited insulation properties. Light cured GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) liner can be used as it provides good insulation and protection to the pulp. Varnish is not typically used as a liner in deep cavities as it does not provide sufficient insulation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Ca(OH)2 liner.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
