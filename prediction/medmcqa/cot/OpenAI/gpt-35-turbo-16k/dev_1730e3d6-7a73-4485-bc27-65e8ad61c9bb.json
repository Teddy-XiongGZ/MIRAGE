    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intensifying screens are used in extraoral radiographs to increase the efficiency of the image receptor. They work by converting X-ray energy into visible light, which in turn exposes the film or digital sensor. This allows for a lower radiation dose to be used while still producing a diagnostic image. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Decrease radiation to patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
