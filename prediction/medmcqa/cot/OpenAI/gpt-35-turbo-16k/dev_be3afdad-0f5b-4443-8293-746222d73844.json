    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fractures occur when the force applied to a bone exceeds its strength. Let's analyze each force:\\n\\nA. Tension: Tension forces pull the bone apart, which can lead to fractures. \\nB. Torsion: Torsion forces twist the bone, causing it to break. \\nC. Compression: Compression forces push the bone together, which can also result in fractures. \\n\\nConsidering these explanations, it is clear that fractures can occur when any of these forces are present on a bone. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Either of the three.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
