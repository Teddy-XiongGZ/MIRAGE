    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in the histopathology of the lymph node suggests a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The absence of CD15 and CD30 expression, as well as the negative EBV status, narrows down the possibilities. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma typically shows nodular architecture with lymphocyte-predominant cells and lacks Reed-Sternberg cells. Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin's lymphoma is characterized by a nodular or diffuse pattern with abundant lymphocytes and few Reed-Sternberg cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and typically lacks Reed-Sternberg cells. Small cell lymphoma is a non-specific term and does not provide a specific diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is B. Lymphocyte rich Hodgkin's lymphoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
