    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Metal base dentures have several advantages compared to other types of dentures. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Increase in tissue tolerance: Metal base dentures are generally more comfortable and better tolerated by the oral tissues compared to other types of dentures. This is because the metal base provides a more stable and secure fit.\\n\\nB. Easy laboratory procedure: While metal base dentures do require some laboratory procedures, they are not necessarily easier or more difficult compared to other types of dentures. This option does not specifically address the advantage of metal base dentures.\\n\\nC. Rebasing and relining are quite easy: Metal base dentures can be easily rebased or relined if necessary. This is because the metal base allows for adjustments and modifications without compromising the structural integrity of the denture.\\n\\nD. Increase in restorative cost: Metal base dentures are generally more expensive compared to other types of dentures. This is because the materials used in metal base dentures, such as cobalt-chromium alloy, are more costly. However, this option does not specifically address the advantage of metal base dentures.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Rebasing and relining are quite easy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
