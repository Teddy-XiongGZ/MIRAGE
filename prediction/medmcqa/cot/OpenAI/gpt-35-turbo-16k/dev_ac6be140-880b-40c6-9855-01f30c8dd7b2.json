    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a calcific bridge forms in a tooth, it is typically due to the deposition of calcium ions. In this case, the question is asking about the source of these calcium ions after a calcium hydroxide pulpotomy has been performed. Calcium hydroxide is commonly used in dental procedures to promote the formation of dentin, which is the hard tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth. Therefore, it is likely that the calcium ions for the calcific bridge are sourced from the dentin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
