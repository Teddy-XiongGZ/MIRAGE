    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Prothrombin time (PT) estimation measures the time it takes for blood to clot. In this test, calcium and thromboplastin are added to platelet poor plasma. Thromboplastin is a mixture of tissue factor and phospholipids, which activates the coagulation cascade. The coagulation cascade consists of two pathways: the intrinsic pathway and the extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is activated by contact with negatively charged surfaces, such as glass or collagen, while the extrinsic pathway is activated by tissue factor. In the PT estimation test, thromboplastin is added, which contains tissue factor. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Extrinsic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
