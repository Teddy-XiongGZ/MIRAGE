    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In severe aortic stenosis (AS), there is obstruction of blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. This obstruction leads to increased pressure in the left ventricle and hypertrophy of the ventricular wall. Based on this understanding, we can evaluate the given options. \\n\\nA. Pulsus bisferiens: Pulsus bisferiens is a double-peaked arterial pulse waveform seen in conditions like aortic regurgitation or combined aortic stenosis and regurgitation. It is not typically seen in isolated severe AS. \\n\\nB. Late ejection systolic click: A late ejection systolic click is a characteristic finding in aortic valve prolapse, not in severe AS. \\n\\nC. Heaving shifted apex: A heaving shifted apex is seen in conditions like left ventricular hypertrophy or left ventricular volume overload, but it is not specific to severe AS. \\n\\nD. Loud S2: In severe AS, the aortic valve is thickened and calcified, leading to decreased valve mobility and impaired closure. This can result in a soft or absent A2 component of the second heart sound (S2). Therefore, a loud S2 is not typically seen in severe AS. \\n\\nConsidering the above explanations, the correct answer is D. Loud S2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
