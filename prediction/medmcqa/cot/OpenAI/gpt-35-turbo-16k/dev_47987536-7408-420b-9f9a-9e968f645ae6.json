    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the signs of brain death, we need to understand what brain death is. Brain death is the irreversible loss of all brain function, including the brainstem. It is important to note that brain death is different from a coma or a vegetative state. In brain death, there is no possibility of recovery. Given this information, let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Normal BP without pharmacological support: In brain death, the brainstem, which controls vital functions such as blood pressure, is non-functional. Therefore, maintaining a normal blood pressure without pharmacological support is not possible. This is a sign of brain death.\\n\\nB. Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation: Spinal reflexes are controlled by the spinal cord, not the brain. In brain death, the brainstem, which connects the brain to the spinal cord, is non-functional. Therefore, positive spinal reflexes on stimulation are not expected in brain death. This is a sign of brain death.\\n\\nC. Sweating and tachycardia: Sweating and tachycardia are controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which is regulated by the brainstem. In brain death, the brainstem is non-functional, and therefore, sweating and tachycardia are not expected. This is a sign of brain death.\\n\\nD. Decorticate and decerebrate posturing: Decorticate and decerebrate posturing are abnormal postures that indicate severe brain damage. In brain death, all brain function, including the brainstem, is lost. Therefore, decorticate and decerebrate posturing are not expected in brain death. This is not a sign of brain death.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is D. Decorticate and decerebrate posturing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
