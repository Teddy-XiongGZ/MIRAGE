    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells found in pulp are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types, but not all cell types. These cells are known as multipotent cells. Totipotent cells have the ability to differentiate into all cell types, including extraembryonic tissues. Polypotent cells can differentiate into multiple cell types, but not all cell types. Monopotent cells can only differentiate into one cell type. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Multipotent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
