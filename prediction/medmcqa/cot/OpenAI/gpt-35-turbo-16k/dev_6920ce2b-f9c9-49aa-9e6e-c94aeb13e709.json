    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pituitary gland is often referred to as the 'master gland' because it controls the function of many other endocrine glands. To determine which endocrine glands are not influenced by the pituitary gland, we need to identify the glands that are not regulated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. A. Thyroid gland, testes, and adrenal medulla: The thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secreted by the pituitary gland, so it is influenced by the pituitary gland. The testes are regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secreted by the pituitary gland, so they are also influenced by the pituitary gland. The adrenal medulla is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system, not by the pituitary gland. B. Adrenal medulla, parathyroids, and the islets of langerhans: The adrenal medulla is not influenced by the pituitary gland. The parathyroids are regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is not secreted by the pituitary gland. The islets of Langerhans in the pancreas are regulated by insulin and glucagon, which are not secreted by the pituitary gland. C. Adrenal cortex, parathyroids, and ovaries: The adrenal cortex is regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreted by the pituitary gland, so it is influenced by the pituitary gland. The parathyroids are not influenced by the pituitary gland. The ovaries are regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secreted by the pituitary gland, so they are influenced by the pituitary gland. D. Pancreas, adrenal medulla, and thyroid gland: The pancreas is not influenced by the pituitary gland. The adrenal medulla is not influenced by the pituitary gland. The thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secreted by the pituitary gland, so it is influenced by the pituitary gland. Based on this analysis, the endocrine glands that are not influenced by the pituitary gland include the adrenal medulla, parathyroids, and the islets of Langerhans. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
