    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When measuring blood pressure, it is important to ensure accurate readings. In the case of a cardiac tamponade patient, there is an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, which can compress the heart and affect blood flow. To obtain accurate blood pressure measurements, it is important for the patient to be in a relaxed state and to breathe normally. Holding breath or taking long and deep breaths can potentially affect blood pressure readings. Shallow breaths may also not provide accurate readings. Therefore, the advice to give to a cardiac tamponade patient while measuring blood pressure would be to breathe normally.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
