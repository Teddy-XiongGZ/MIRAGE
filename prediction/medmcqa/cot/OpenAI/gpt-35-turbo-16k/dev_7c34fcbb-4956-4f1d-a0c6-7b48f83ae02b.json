    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, there are several hormonal and physiological changes that occur in the body. One of these changes is an increase in blood volume and cardiac output. This increased blood volume can lead to increased fluid retention and increased pressure within the blood vessels. However, when it comes to intraocular pressure (IOP), the evidence is not clear. Some studies suggest that IOP may increase during pregnancy due to the increased blood volume and fluid retention. On the other hand, other studies suggest that IOP may remain the same or even decrease during pregnancy. Overall, the exact effect of pregnancy on IOP is not well-established and can vary from person to person.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. None\"}"
