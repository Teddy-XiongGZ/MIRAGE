    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sublingual salivary gland is one of the three major salivary glands located in the oral cavity. To determine its position, we need to consider the anatomical landmarks. The mylohyoid muscle is a muscle that forms the floor of the mouth. The genioglossus muscle is a muscle that forms the bulk of the tongue. The geniohyoid muscle is a muscle that lies deep to the mylohyoid muscle. Based on this information, we can conclude that the sublingual salivary gland lies superior to the mylohyoid muscle and deep to the genioglossus muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Superior to mylohyoid\"}"
