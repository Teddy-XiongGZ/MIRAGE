    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ductus dependent blood flow refers to the reliance on the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) for blood flow in certain cardiac defects. The PDA is a blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta in fetal circulation. After birth, the PDA normally closes. Therefore, the cardiac defect that is not characterized by ductus dependent blood flow would be the one in which the blood flow does not rely on the PDA. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Transposition of great arteries with intact septum: In this condition, the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. Since the two great arteries are not connected, the blood flow is not dependent on the PDA. \\n\\nB. Interrupted aortic arch: This condition is characterized by a complete interruption of the aortic arch. The blood flow to the lower body is dependent on the PDA. \\n\\nC. Truncus arteriosus: In this defect, there is a single arterial trunk that arises from both ventricles. The blood flow to the pulmonary artery is dependent on the PDA. \\n\\nD. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: This condition is characterized by underdevelopment of the left side of the heart. The blood flow to the systemic circulation is dependent on the PDA. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Transposition of great arteries with intact septum, as it is not characterized by ductus dependent blood flow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
