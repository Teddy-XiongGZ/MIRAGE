    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cephalometric analysis is a method used in orthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery to evaluate growth changes in the craniofacial region. It involves superimposing various anatomical landmarks on a radiograph to assess changes over time. To determine which option is used for superimposing, we need to understand the purpose of cephalometric analysis. One of the main goals is to evaluate skeletal changes. The Sella-Nasion plane is commonly used as a reference plane in cephalometric analysis because it represents the cranial base and is relatively stable. The Mandibular plane is used to assess changes in the position and growth of the mandible. FHP stands for Frankfort Horizontal Plane, which is a reference plane used to assess the position of the maxilla and mandible in relation to the cranial base. The Occlusal plane is used to evaluate dental changes. Based on this information, the most appropriate option for superimposing in cephalometric analysis to evaluate growth changes would be the Sella-Nasion plane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
