    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the distribution of the data, we need to analyze the shape of the data. In this case, we are given that most of the readings are 7 or above. This suggests that the data is skewed towards the higher values. Skewness refers to the asymmetry of the data distribution. If the tail of the distribution is on the right side, it is positively skewed. If the tail is on the left side, it is negatively skewed. Since most of the readings are 7 or above, it indicates that the tail of the distribution is on the left side, and therefore the data is negatively skewed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
