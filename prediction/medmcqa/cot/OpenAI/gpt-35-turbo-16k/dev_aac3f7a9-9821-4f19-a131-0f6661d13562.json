    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Regional Odontodysplasia is a rare developmental disorder affecting the teeth. It is characterized by abnormal formation of enamel and dentin, resulting in teeth that are hypoplastic, hypocalcified, and have an abnormal shape. The condition typically affects only a few teeth in a specific region of the mouth. To determine which tooth is most commonly affected by Regional Odontodysplasia, we need to consider the location and prevalence of the condition. A. Mandibular premolar: This tooth is located in the lower jaw and is not commonly affected by Regional Odontodysplasia. B. Mandibular canine: This tooth is also located in the lower jaw and is not commonly affected by Regional Odontodysplasia. C. Mandibular third molar: This tooth is the last molar in the lower jaw and is not commonly affected by Regional Odontodysplasia. D. Maxillary central incisor: This tooth is located in the upper jaw and is commonly affected by Regional Odontodysplasia. Based on the location and prevalence of Regional Odontodysplasia, the most common tooth to be affected is the maxillary central incisor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
