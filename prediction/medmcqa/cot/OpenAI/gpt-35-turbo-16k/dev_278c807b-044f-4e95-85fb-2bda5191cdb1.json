    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent proximal displacement of the restoration in a MO cavity prepared for inlay, the mechanical advantage is established by ensuring certain factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Adequate pulpal depth: While adequate pulpal depth is important for the overall success of the restoration, it does not directly prevent proximal displacement.\\n\\nB. Parallel walls: Parallel walls in the cavity preparation help to provide stability and prevent displacement of the restoration.\\n\\nC. Occlusal dovetail: An occlusal dovetail is a retention feature that helps to prevent occlusal displacement of the restoration, but it does not directly address proximal displacement.\\n\\nD. Acute lingual inclination in axiogingival area: This option does not provide a clear explanation of how it would prevent proximal displacement.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. Parallel walls.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
