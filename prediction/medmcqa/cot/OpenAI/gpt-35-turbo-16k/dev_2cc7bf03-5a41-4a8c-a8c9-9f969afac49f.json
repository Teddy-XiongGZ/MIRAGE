    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To assess the strength of association between smoking and lung cancer in a quick time, the best study design would be a case-control study. In a case-control study, individuals with lung cancer (cases) and individuals without lung cancer (controls) are identified, and their smoking history is compared. This design allows for a quick assessment of the association between smoking and lung cancer because it is retrospective and does not require following individuals over a long period of time. Cross-sectional studies assess the prevalence of a condition at a specific point in time and do not provide information on causality. Randomized controlled trials are typically used to assess the effectiveness of interventions, not to study associations. Cohort studies follow individuals over time to assess the development of outcomes, but they are not as quick as case-control studies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Case control study\"}"
