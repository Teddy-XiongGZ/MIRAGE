    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antigenic drift refers to the gradual accumulation of small genetic changes in the genes that code for viral surface proteins. These changes can lead to the emergence of new strains of the virus. Now let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. It is seen only in influenza virus type A: This statement is incorrect. Antigenic drift can occur in both influenza virus type A and type B.\\n\\nB. It is a result of frameshift mutation: This statement is incorrect. Antigenic drift is not caused by frameshift mutations. It is caused by point mutations, which are small changes in the genetic code.\\n\\nC. It mostly affects the matrix protein: This statement is incorrect. Antigenic drift affects the surface proteins of the virus, such as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins.\\n\\nD. It mostly affects the matrix protein: This statement is incorrect. Antigenic drift affects the surface proteins of the virus, such as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is none of the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
