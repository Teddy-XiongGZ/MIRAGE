    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a 2-week-old infant with conjunctivitis, respiratory distress, and pneumonia, the most likely organism is Chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of conjunctivitis in newborns, known as neonatal conjunctivitis. It can also cause pneumonia in infants. The presence of bilateral lung infiltrates on chest X-ray and an elevated WBC count further support the diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is a common cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis but is less likely in this case as it typically presents with respiratory distress and pneumonia without conjunctivitis. Gonococcus (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) can cause conjunctivitis in newborns but is less likely to cause pneumonia. Haemophilus influenzae can cause pneumonia in infants, but it is less common in this age group compared to Chlamydia trachomatis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
