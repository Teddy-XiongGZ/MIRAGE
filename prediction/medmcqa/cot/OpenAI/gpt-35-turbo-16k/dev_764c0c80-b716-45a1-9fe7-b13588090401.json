    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the central value of a set of 180 values, we need to determine the value that represents the middle of the set. The central value is also known as the median. Step 1: Arrange the values in ascending order. Step 2: Determine the position of the middle value. Since there are 180 values, the middle value will be at position (180 + 1) / 2 = 90.5. Step 3: Since the position is not a whole number, we need to find the average of the values at positions 90 and 91. This will give us the central value. Step 4: Compare the potential choices with the steps we have taken. - A. 2nd tertile: The 2nd tertile represents the 66th percentile, which is not the middle value. - B. 90th percentile: The 90th percentile represents the value below which 90% of the values fall, which is not the middle value. - C. 2nd quartile: The 2nd quartile represents the 50th percentile, which is the middle value. This is the correct choice. - D. 9th decile: The 9th decile represents the value below which 90% of the values fall, which is not the middle value. Therefore, the answer is C. 2nd quartile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
