    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fick's law is a principle that describes the rate of diffusion of molecules across a concentration gradient. It specifically deals with passive diffusion of molecules along the concentration gradient. Active diffusion, on the other hand, requires the use of energy to move molecules against the concentration gradient. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Passive diffusion of molecules along the concentration gradient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
