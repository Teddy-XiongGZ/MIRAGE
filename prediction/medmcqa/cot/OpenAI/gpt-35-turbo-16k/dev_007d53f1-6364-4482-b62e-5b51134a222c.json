    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Since the child has received full Rabies vaccination in December 2018, it is important to assess the severity of the wound and the risk of exposure to Rabies. If the wound is a high-risk category, such as a bite from a stray animal or an animal with unknown vaccination status, then the next line of management would be to administer Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) along with 5 doses of Rabies vaccine (Option B). However, if the wound is a low-risk category, such as a scratch from a pet with a known vaccination status, then no vaccine may be required (Option A). Therefore, the answer choice would depend on the severity of the wound and the risk of exposure to Rabies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
