    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In arterial gas analysis, pCO2 refers to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood. The maximum pCO2 is seen in the stage where there is impaired gas exchange or increased production of carbon dioxide. This typically occurs in conditions such as respiratory failure or severe lung disease. Therefore, the answer is likely to be the stage that corresponds to the most severe impairment of gas exchange or the highest production of carbon dioxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
