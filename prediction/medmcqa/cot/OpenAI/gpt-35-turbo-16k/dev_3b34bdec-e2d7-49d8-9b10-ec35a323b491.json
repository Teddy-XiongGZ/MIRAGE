    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the disproportion in the size between maxillary and mandibular teeth, we need to consider the analysis methods that specifically focus on tooth size discrepancies. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Pont's analysis: Pont's analysis is used to determine the mesiodistal width of the maxillary anterior teeth. It does not directly assess the disproportion between maxillary and mandibular teeth.\\n\\nB. Bolton's analysis: Bolton's analysis is a commonly used method to evaluate the tooth size discrepancies between the maxillary and mandibular arches. It assesses the ratio of the mesiodistal widths of all the teeth in both arches.\\n\\nC. Peck and Peck analysis: Peck and Peck analysis is primarily used to assess the dental arch form and tooth size discrepancies in the mixed dentition. It does not specifically focus on the disproportion between maxillary and mandibular teeth.\\n\\nD. Carey's analysis: Carey's analysis is not a recognized method for determining the disproportion in the size between maxillary and mandibular teeth.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is B. Bolton's analysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
