    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resin teeth are a type of dental prosthesis used to replace missing teeth. They are typically made from a composite resin material. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is true for resin teeth. A. Show a high compressive strength: Compressive strength refers to the ability of a material to withstand compressive forces. While resin teeth can be strong, they generally do not have a high compressive strength compared to other materials like metal or ceramic. B. Contraindicated in patients with decreased inter occlusal distance: Inter occlusal distance refers to the space between the upper and lower teeth when the jaw is closed. Resin teeth can be customized to fit different inter occlusal distances, so they are not contraindicated in patients with decreased inter occlusal distance. C. Show crazing: Crazing refers to the formation of small cracks or lines on the surface of a material. Resin teeth can be prone to crazing over time due to wear and tear, but it is not a characteristic feature of resin teeth. D. Show a high fracture strength: Fracture strength refers to the ability of a material to resist breaking or fracturing. Resin teeth can have a high fracture strength, especially when reinforced with other materials like fibers or metal. Based on the evaluation, the correct answer is D. Show a high fracture strength.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
