    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the blood pressure above which 95 percent of people would fall, we need to calculate the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile. The z-score can be calculated using the formula: z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where x is the value we want to find, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. In this case, we want to find the value of x. Rearranging the formula, we have x = z * \u03c3 + \u03bc. Since we want to find the value above which 95 percent of people would fall, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile, which is approximately 1.645. Plugging in the values, we have x = 1.645 * 10 + 125 = 141.45 mm Hg. Therefore, 95 percent of people would have blood pressure above 141.45 mm Hg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
