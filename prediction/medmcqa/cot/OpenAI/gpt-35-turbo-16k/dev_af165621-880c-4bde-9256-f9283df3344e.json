    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is not used as an antiflux, we need to understand what antiflux is. Antiflux is a substance that prevents the flow of molten metal into unwanted areas during soldering or brazing. It is typically applied to surfaces to create a barrier. Now, let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Graphite: Graphite is commonly used as an antiflux because it forms a protective barrier against molten metal.\\n\\nB. Boric acid: Boric acid is also used as an antiflux because it forms a glassy coating that prevents the flow of molten metal.\\n\\nC. Iron oxide: Iron oxide is not commonly used as an antiflux. It is more commonly used as a pigment or in rust prevention.\\n\\nD. Calcium carbonate with alcohol: Calcium carbonate with alcohol is not typically used as an antiflux. Calcium carbonate is more commonly used as a filler or abrasive, and alcohol is not typically used as an antiflux either. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is C. Iron oxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
