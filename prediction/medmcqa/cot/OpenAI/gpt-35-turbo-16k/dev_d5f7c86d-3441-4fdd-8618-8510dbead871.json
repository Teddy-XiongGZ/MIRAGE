    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: The question is asking about the maximum number of genes that code for receptors in the mammalian genome. Step 2: Let's analyze each option: - Option A: Immunoglobulin receptors are involved in the immune response, but they are not the main receptors in the mammalian genome. - Option B: Interleukins are signaling molecules involved in the immune response, but they are not receptors themselves. - Option C: Growth factors are signaling molecules involved in cell growth and development, but they are not receptors themselves. - Option D: Odorants are molecules that are detected by olfactory receptors in the nose. Olfactory receptors are a large family of receptors in the mammalian genome. Step 3: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Odorants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
