    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a subcondylar fracture, the condyle of the mandible is fractured near the neck region. Medial dislocation of the fractured condyle occurs when the fractured condyle is displaced medially. To determine the cause of medial dislocation, we need to consider the muscles that attach to the condyle and can potentially cause its displacement. The muscles that attach to the condyle include the lateral pterygoid, medial pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis. Out of these muscles, the lateral pterygoid is the main muscle responsible for the medial dislocation of the fractured condyle. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Lateral pterygoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
