    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the 10-year-old boy has a contaminated wound over his left leg following a road traffic accident. It is important to assess the risk of tetanus infection in this case. The boy has received his complete primary immunization before preschool age and a booster of DT at school entry age. Tetanus toxoid (TT) is recommended for individuals who have not received a booster dose within the last 5 years. Since the boy has received a booster dose recently, injection of TT is not necessary. Human antiserum is used for passive immunization in individuals who have not been adequately immunized against tetanus. However, since the boy has received his complete primary immunization and a booster dose, injection of human antiserum is not required. Broad spectrum antibiotics may be considered to prevent or treat infection in contaminated wounds. Wound debridement and cleaning are important to remove any foreign material and reduce the risk of infection. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Injection of human antiserum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
