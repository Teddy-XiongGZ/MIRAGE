    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reed-Sternberg cells are the characteristic cells found in Hodgkin's lymphoma. To determine their origin, we need to consider the cell types involved in the immune response. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that affects the lymphatic system, which is a part of the immune system. The immune system consists of various types of cells, including macrophages, NK cells, T cells, and B cells. Macrophages are phagocytic cells involved in the innate immune response. NK cells are a type of lymphocyte involved in the innate immune response. T cells and B cells are lymphocytes involved in the adaptive immune response. In Hodgkin's lymphoma, the Reed-Sternberg cells are derived from B cells. These abnormal B cells undergo malignant transformation and give rise to the Reed-Sternberg cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
