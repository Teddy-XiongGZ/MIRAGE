    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Before pouring an elastic impression, it is important to wash it with a slurry of water and stone to remove any contaminants and ensure a clean surface for the pouring material. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Increase gel strength: Washing the impression with water and stone slurry does not directly increase the gel strength of the impression material.\\n\\nB. Prevent syneresis: Syneresis refers to the loss of liquid from a gel, which is not relevant in this context. Washing the impression with water and stone slurry does not prevent syneresis.\\n\\nC. Prevent distortion: Washing the impression with water and stone slurry helps remove any debris or contaminants that could potentially cause distortion in the final poured model. This is a valid reason for washing the impression.\\n\\nD. Wash off saliva on impression: Washing the impression with water and stone slurry can help remove saliva or other contaminants that may be present on the impression surface. This is another valid reason for washing the impression.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the correct answer is either C. Prevent distortion or D. Wash off saliva on impression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C/D\"}"
