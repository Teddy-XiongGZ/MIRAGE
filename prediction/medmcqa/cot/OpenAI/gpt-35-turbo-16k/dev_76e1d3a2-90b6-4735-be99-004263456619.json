    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The resistance form in endodontics refers to the ability of the tooth structure to resist displacement or movement during the obturation process. It is important for the success of the root canal treatment. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Resists movement of gutta-percha in apical area: This option refers to the ability of the tooth structure to prevent the gutta-percha material from being pushed out of the apical area. While this is important, it is not the primary definition of resistance form.\\n\\nB. To allow use of spreader in lateral condensation: This option refers to the ability of the tooth structure to withstand the forces applied during lateral condensation, which involves the use of a spreader. This is a valid aspect of resistance form.\\n\\nC. Fracture of root while vertical condensation: This option suggests that the root may fracture during vertical condensation, which is not related to resistance form.\\n\\nD. None of the above: This option implies that none of the provided options are correct. Let's evaluate the options again to determine the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
