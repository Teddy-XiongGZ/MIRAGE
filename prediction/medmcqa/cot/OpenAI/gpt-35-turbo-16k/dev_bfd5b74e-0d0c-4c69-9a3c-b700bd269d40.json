    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Universal pro-taper re-treatment files are used for removing gutta-percha during root canal retreatment. These files have different designs and features. To determine which file has an end cutting tip, we need to examine the characteristics of each file. \\n\\nA. D1: The D1 file has a non-cutting tip, which means it does not have an end cutting tip. \\n\\nB. D2: The D2 file also has a non-cutting tip, so it does not have an end cutting tip either. \\n\\nC. D3: The D3 file, on the other hand, has an end cutting tip. This means it is designed to cut and remove gutta-percha at the apical portion of the root canal. \\n\\nD. All of the above: Since only the D3 file has an end cutting tip, the correct answer is not 'All of the above'.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
