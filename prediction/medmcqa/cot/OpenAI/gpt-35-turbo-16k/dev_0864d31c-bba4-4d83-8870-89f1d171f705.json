    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the primary survey of a trauma patient, the focus is on identifying and managing life-threatening injuries. Imaging plays a crucial role in this process. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Cervical X-ray is not mandatory: Cervical spine injuries are common in trauma patients, especially those with head or neck trauma. Therefore, a cervical X-ray is typically performed as part of the primary survey to rule out any cervical spine injuries. This statement is false.\\n\\nB. Chest X-ray and pelvic X-ray are taken as a part of the primary survey: Chest X-ray and pelvic X-ray are commonly performed in the primary survey to assess for any life-threatening injuries such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pelvic fractures. This statement is true.\\n\\nC. Hemodynamically unstable patients should not be sent for CT scan: Hemodynamically unstable patients are at high risk of deteriorating during transportation or imaging procedures. Therefore, it is generally recommended to stabilize these patients before sending them for further imaging, such as a CT scan. This statement is true.\\n\\nD. All patients should have chest X-ray-PA view only: While a chest X-ray is commonly performed in the primary survey, the choice of view (PA or AP) may vary depending on the patient's condition and clinical suspicion. Both PA and AP views can provide valuable information, and the choice should be based on the individual patient's needs. This statement is false.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is option D. All patients should have chest X-ray-PA view only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
