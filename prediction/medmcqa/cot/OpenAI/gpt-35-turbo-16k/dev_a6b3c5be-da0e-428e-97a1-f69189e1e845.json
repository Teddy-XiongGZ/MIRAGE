Since the child is not experiencing any pain, it suggests that the pulp may still be vital. In such cases, the treatment of choice is usually pulpotomy, which involves removing the infected pulp tissue and leaving the vital pulp intact. Indirect pulp capping is typically done when the decay has not reached the pulp or when the pulp is mildly affected. Root canal treatment (RCT) is usually reserved for cases where the pulp is non-vital or irreversibly damaged.
