    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Phosphate is an important mineral found in the body, primarily in bones and teeth. It is also present in other tissues and fluids in smaller amounts. To determine the maximum amount of phosphate, we need to consider where it is most concentrated. A. Bone is a logical choice as it is the primary storage site for phosphate. B. Enamel is the hard outer layer of the tooth and contains a significant amount of minerals, including phosphate. C. Gingiva, also known as the gums, is primarily composed of connective tissue and does not contain a high concentration of phosphate. D. Dentine is the layer beneath the enamel and is also mineralized, but it contains less phosphate compared to enamel. Based on this information, the answer is A. Bone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
