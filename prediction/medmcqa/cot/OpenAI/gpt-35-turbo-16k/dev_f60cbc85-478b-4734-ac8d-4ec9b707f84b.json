    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To demonstrate a nasal fracture, we need a radiographic view that provides a clear visualization of the nasal bones. The reverse towne's view is used to evaluate the occipital condyles and is not suitable for demonstrating a nasal fracture. The PA view (posteroanterior) is commonly used for evaluating the chest and lungs, not specifically for nasal fractures. The OPG (orthopantomogram) is a panoramic dental x-ray that is not specifically designed for nasal fractures. The true lateral view, on the other hand, provides a direct lateral view of the nasal bones and is the radiographic view of choice for demonstrating a nasal fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. True lateral\"}"
