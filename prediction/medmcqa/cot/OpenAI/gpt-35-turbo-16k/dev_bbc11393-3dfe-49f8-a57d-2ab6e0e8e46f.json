    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rampant caries refers to a severe and rapid progression of dental caries. To determine the caries rate for rampant caries, we need to consider the number of new lesions per year. The term 'rampant' suggests a high rate of new lesions. Based on the options provided, we can eliminate options A and B as they indicate a relatively lower number of new lesions per year. Option D, which suggests 15 or more new lesions per year, seems excessive and unlikely. Therefore, the most appropriate choice would be option C, which indicates 10 or more new lesions per year.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
