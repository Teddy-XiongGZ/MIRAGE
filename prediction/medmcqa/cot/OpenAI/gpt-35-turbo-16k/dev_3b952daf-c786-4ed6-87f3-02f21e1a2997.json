    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best drug to manage a patient with new onset focal seizures depends on several factors, including the patient's age, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions. However, in general, the first-line treatment for focal seizures is an antiepileptic drug (AED) that is effective for focal seizures and has a favorable side effect profile. Sodium valproate (Choice A) is a broad-spectrum AED that is effective for focal seizures, but it is associated with significant side effects, including hepatotoxicity and weight gain. Oxcarbazepine (Choice B) is also effective for focal seizures and has a better side effect profile compared to sodium valproate. Leviteracetam (Choice C) is another option for focal seizures and is generally well-tolerated. Pregabalin (Choice D) is not typically used as a first-line treatment for focal seizures. Based on the information provided, the best drug to manage the patient would be either Oxcarbazepine (Choice B) or Leviteracetam (Choice C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/C\"}"
