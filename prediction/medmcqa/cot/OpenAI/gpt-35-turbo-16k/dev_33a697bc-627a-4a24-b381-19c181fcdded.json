    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in evaluating a newborn child not passing urine for 36 hours would be to assess the baby's hydration status and overall condition. This can be done by checking the baby's vital signs, examining the baby for signs of dehydration, and assessing the baby's weight loss. If the baby is stable and there are no signs of dehydration, the next step would be to perform a physical examination to look for any anatomical abnormalities or signs of obstruction. If there are no obvious abnormalities on physical examination, the next step would be to obtain a renal ultrasound to evaluate the kidneys and bladder for any structural abnormalities or signs of obstruction. CT scan and cystoscopy are more invasive procedures and would not be the initial method of choice for a newborn. X-ray pelvis may provide some information, but it is not as sensitive as ultrasound in evaluating the kidneys and bladder. Therefore, the answer choice would be A. Ultrasound of kidney & bladder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
