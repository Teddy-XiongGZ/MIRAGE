    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition characterized by a reversal of a left-to-right shunt to a right-to-left shunt due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. This occurs as a result of long-standing pulmonary hypertension. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Pulmonary veins are not distended: In Eisenmenger syndrome, the pulmonary veins are typically dilated due to increased pulmonary venous pressure. Therefore, this option is false.\\n\\nB. RV & LV walls come back to normal size: In Eisenmenger syndrome, the right ventricle (RV) undergoes hypertrophy due to increased workload. The left ventricle (LV) may also show signs of hypertrophy or dilation. Therefore, this option is false.\\n\\nC. Dilatation of central pulmonary artery: In Eisenmenger syndrome, there is increased pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to dilatation of the central pulmonary artery. This is a characteristic finding. Therefore, this option is true.\\n\\nD. Peripheral pruning of pulmonary arteries: In Eisenmenger syndrome, there is progressive narrowing and pruning of the peripheral pulmonary arteries due to chronic hypoxemia and decreased blood flow. Therefore, this option is true.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, options A and B are false, while options C and D are true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
