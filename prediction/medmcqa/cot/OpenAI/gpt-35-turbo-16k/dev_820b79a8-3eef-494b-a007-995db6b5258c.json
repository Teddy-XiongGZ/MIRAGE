    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which nerve fiber type is least susceptible to LA blockade, we need to understand the different types of nerve fibers and their susceptibility to local anesthetic (LA) blockade. A beta fibers are large myelinated fibers responsible for proprioception and touch. They are moderately susceptible to LA blockade. A alpha fibers are also large myelinated fibers responsible for motor function and proprioception. They are highly susceptible to LA blockade. B fibers are small myelinated fibers responsible for autonomic functions. They are moderately susceptible to LA blockade. C fibers are small unmyelinated fibers responsible for pain and temperature sensation. They are the most susceptible to LA blockade. Based on this information, the least susceptible nerve fiber type to LA blockade would be A beta fibers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
