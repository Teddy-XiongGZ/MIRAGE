    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR), we need to find the difference in the risk of developing HT complications between the intervention group and the control group. The risk in the control group is calculated by dividing the number of patients who developed HT complications by the total number of subjects in the control group. The risk in the intervention group is calculated in the same way. The ARR is then the difference between the two risks. To calculate the relative risk (RR), we need to divide the risk in the intervention group by the risk in the control group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. ARR = 1% and RR = 0.9\"}"
