    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The student t test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is commonly used when the data follows a normal distribution and the variances of the two groups are assumed to be equal. The test is parametric because it makes assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. Additionally, the t test is based on the difference in means, not the variance. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Parametric test based on average.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
