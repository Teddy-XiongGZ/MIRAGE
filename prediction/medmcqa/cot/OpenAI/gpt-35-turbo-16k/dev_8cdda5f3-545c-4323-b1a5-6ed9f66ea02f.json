    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The outer membrane of a peripheral nerve is responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential and controlling the movement of ions. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Relative permeable to sodium ions: This is not true. The outer membrane of a peripheral nerve is relatively impermeable to sodium ions at rest.\\n\\nB. Relative permeable to potassium ions: This is true. The outer membrane of a peripheral nerve is relatively permeable to potassium ions, allowing for the generation of the resting membrane potential.\\n\\nC. Permeable to chloride ions: This is not true. The outer membrane of a peripheral nerve is relatively impermeable to chloride ions at rest.\\n\\nD. Impermeable to potassium ions: This is not true. As mentioned earlier, the outer membrane of a peripheral nerve is relatively permeable to potassium ions. \\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. Relative permeable to potassium ions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
