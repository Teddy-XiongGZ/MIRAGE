    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid prototyping is a technique used to quickly create a physical model or prototype of a design. It involves using various methods and materials to build the prototype. Let's evaluate each statement to determine which one is true. \\n\\nA. Photopolymer resin cures with laser: This statement is true. Photopolymer resin is a common material used in rapid prototyping, and it can be cured or hardened using a laser.\\n\\nB. Powder by fused deposition modeling: This statement is not true. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) involves extruding a thermoplastic filament, not using powder.\\n\\nC. Selective laser sintering: This statement is true. Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a rapid prototyping technique that uses a laser to selectively fuse powdered material together.\\n\\nD. All of the above: Since statement B is not true, we can conclude that not all of the statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Photopolymer resin cures with laser.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
