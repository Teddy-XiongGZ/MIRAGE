    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity are determined by specific factors. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Direction of enamel rods: The direction of enamel rods does not directly determine the mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity.\\n\\nB. Presence of carious lesion: The presence of a carious lesion can affect the extent and shape of the cavity, but it does not specifically determine the mesial and distal walls.\\n\\nC. Contour of gingiva: The contour of the gingiva does not have a direct influence on the mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity.\\n\\nD. Location of contact area: The location of the contact area between teeth can determine the position and shape of the mesial and distal walls of a class V cavity. When the cavity is located near the contact area, the walls will be influenced by the contact point.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Location of contact area.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
