    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the patient has been diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is a non-invasive form of breast cancer. The tumor has been surgically removed with adequate margins and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement. However, the postoperative histopathology report shows high-grade necrosis and a 4 mm clearance on the margins. The presence of high-grade necrosis and close margins suggests a higher risk of recurrence. Therefore, adjuvant treatment is usually recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence. Option A, adjuvant chemotherapy, is not typically indicated for DCIS as it is a non-invasive form of breast cancer. Chemotherapy is usually reserved for invasive breast cancer. Option B, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, is also not typically indicated for DCIS. Chemoradiotherapy is usually reserved for cases of invasive breast cancer with a higher risk of recurrence. Option C, adjuvant radiotherapy, is the most appropriate choice in this scenario. Radiotherapy is commonly recommended after surgery for DCIS to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Option D, no additional treatment, is not recommended in this case due to the presence of high-grade necrosis and close margins. Therefore, the answer is C. Adjuvant radiotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
