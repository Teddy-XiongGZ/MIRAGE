    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Isolated aortic stenosis refers to a narrowing of the aortic valve without any other associated cardiac abnormalities. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Pulsus bisferiens: Pulsus bisferiens is a double-peaked pulse waveform that is commonly seen in patients with combined aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation. It is not typically seen in isolated aortic stenosis.\\n\\nB. Cardiac apex is displaced laterally to the left: In isolated aortic stenosis, the cardiac apex is typically not displaced laterally. This finding is more commonly associated with left ventricular hypertrophy.\\n\\nC. Thrill in carotid artery: A thrill is a palpable vibration that can be felt over a blood vessel. In isolated aortic stenosis, a thrill may be present in the carotid artery due to the turbulent blood flow caused by the stenotic aortic valve.\\n\\nD. Blood pressure maintained in initial phase: In isolated aortic stenosis, the blood pressure may be maintained in the initial phase due to compensatory mechanisms. However, as the stenosis progresses, the blood pressure may decrease.\\n\\nBased on this information, the option that is not true about isolated aortic stenosis is option B. Cardiac apex is displaced laterally to the left.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
