    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Heparin acts as an adjuvant by enhancing the activity of certain proteins involved in the regulation of blood clotting. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Antithrombin III: Heparin binds to antithrombin III and enhances its inhibitory effect on clotting factors, thereby preventing the formation of blood clots. This is a known mechanism of action for heparin.\\n\\nB. Protein C: Heparin does not directly interact with protein C, so it is unlikely to act as an adjuvant for this protein.\\n\\nC. Protein S: Heparin does not directly interact with protein S, so it is unlikely to act as an adjuvant for this protein.\\n\\nD. Thrombomodulin: Heparin does not directly interact with thrombomodulin, so it is unlikely to act as an adjuvant for this protein.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Antithrombin III.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
