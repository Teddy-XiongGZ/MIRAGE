    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this situation, the doctor advised the patient to get regular dressing of his wound done. The patient, however, did not follow the doctor's advice and neglected to do the dressing himself. Despite repeated reminders from the doctor, the patient did not take the necessary steps to care for his wound. As a result, the wound enlarged and developed osteomyelitis, which is a serious infection of the bone. Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the doctor is not guilty under 'Contributory negligence'. Contributory negligence refers to a situation where the plaintiff's own negligence contributes to the harm they suffer. In this case, the patient's negligence in not following the doctor's advice and neglecting the wound care contributed to the development of osteomyelitis. The doctor cannot be held guilty under the 'Last clear chance' doctrine either.
