    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Niacin and riboflavin are both B vitamins that play important roles in various metabolic reactions in the body. Let's analyze each option to determine which one is correct:\\n\\nA. Redox reactions: Niacin and riboflavin are involved in redox reactions as coenzymes. Niacin is a precursor for the coenzymes NAD+ and NADP+, which are involved in redox reactions. Riboflavin is a precursor for the coenzymes FAD and FMN, which are also involved in redox reactions. Therefore, option A is correct.\\n\\nB. Transamination reaction: Transamination reactions involve the transfer of an amino group from one molecule to another. Niacin and riboflavin are not directly involved in transamination reactions, so option B is incorrect.\\n\\nC. Methyl group transfer: Methyl group transfer reactions involve the transfer of a methyl group from one molecule to another. Niacin and riboflavin are not directly involved in methyl group transfer reactions, so option C is incorrect.\\n\\nD. Amine group transfer: Amine group transfer reactions involve the transfer of an amine group from one molecule to another. Niacin and riboflavin are not directly involved in amine group transfer reactions, so option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
