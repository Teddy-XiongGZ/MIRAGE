    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hormones can act in different ways, either by binding to cell surface receptors or by crossing the cell membrane and binding to intracellular receptors. To determine which hormone acts by crossing the cell membrane, we need to consider the characteristics of each hormone. Thyroxine is a thyroid hormone that acts by binding to intracellular receptors, so it crosses the cell membrane. Insulin, glucagon, and calcitonin, on the other hand, act by binding to cell surface receptors and do not cross the cell membrane. Therefore, the hormone that acts by crossing the cell membrane is A. Thyroxine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
