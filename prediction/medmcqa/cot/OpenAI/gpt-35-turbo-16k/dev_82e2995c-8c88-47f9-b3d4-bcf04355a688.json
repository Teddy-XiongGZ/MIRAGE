    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Diffuse wall thickening of the gallbladder with hyperechoic nodules at the neck and comet tail artifacts are characteristic findings of a specific condition. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Adenomyomatosis: Adenomyomatosis is a benign condition characterized by hyperplasia of the gallbladder wall. It typically presents with Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which are outpouchings of the mucosa into the muscular layer. This condition does not typically present with hyperechoic nodules or comet tail artifacts.\\n\\nB. Adenocarcinoma of gallbladder: Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder is a malignant tumor that can cause gallbladder wall thickening. However, it does not typically present with hyperechoic nodules or comet tail artifacts.\\n\\nC. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gallbladder. It can cause diffuse gallbladder wall thickening and may present with hyperechoic nodules. However, it does not typically present with comet tail artifacts.\\n\\nD. Cholesterol crystals: Cholesterol crystals can cause comet tail artifacts on ultrasound. They are typically seen in the gallbladder lumen rather than in the wall. They do not typically cause diffuse gallbladder wall thickening or hyperechoic nodules.\\n\\nBased on the given findings of diffuse wall thickening with hyperechoic nodules at the neck and comet tail artifacts, the most likely diagnosis is Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (option C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
