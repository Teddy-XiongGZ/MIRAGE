    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar levels by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose. It is commonly used in the management of hypoglycemia. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not a suitable candidate for glucagon administration:\\n\\nA. Large for date baby: Large for date babies are at risk for hypoglycemia due to maternal diabetes. Glucagon can be effective in managing hypoglycemia in these babies.\\n\\nB. Galactosemia: Galactosemia is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Glucagon is not effective in managing hypoglycemia in galactosemia.\\n\\nC. Infant of diabetic mother: Infants born to diabetic mothers are at risk for hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin production. Glucagon can be effective in managing hypoglycemia in these infants.\\n\\nD. Nesidioblastosis: Nesidioblastosis is a condition characterized by excessive insulin production by the pancreas. Glucagon is not effective in managing hypoglycemia in nesidioblastosis.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is B. Galactosemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
