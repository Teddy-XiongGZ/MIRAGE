    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in sorting a patient with a head injury is to assess their condition and prioritize their care based on the severity of their injury and the availability of resources. This process is known as triage. Triage helps in determining the order in which patients should receive medical attention. Once the patient has been triaged, they may require emergency care, which involves immediate interventions to stabilize their condition. If the patient's condition is stable and they require further specialized treatment, they may be transferred to a facility that provides definitive care. Finally, if the patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and treatment, they may be admitted to the hospital for further care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Triage\"}"
