    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Before an arbitrary face bow transfer record, the dentist must determine the axial centre of rotation of the condyle. This is because the face bow transfer record is used to accurately transfer the position of the patient's maxilla to an articulator. The axial centre of rotation of the condyle is an important reference point for this transfer, as it represents the rotational axis around which the mandible moves. By determining the axial centre of rotation of the condyle, the dentist can ensure that the articulator accurately replicates the patient's mandibular movements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
