    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In chronic allergy, the immune system produces antibodies called immunoglobulins (Ig) in response to the allergen. The most common immunoglobulins involved in allergic reactions are IgE and IgG. IgE is responsible for immediate hypersensitivity reactions, while IgG is involved in delayed hypersensitivity reactions. IgA is primarily found in mucosal areas and is not typically associated with chronic allergies. IgM is the first antibody produced in response to an infection and is not directly involved in chronic allergies. Therefore, the correct answer is B. lg E.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
