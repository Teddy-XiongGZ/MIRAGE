    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"SCID stands for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, which is a group of rare genetic disorders that impair the immune system. SCID is caused by mutations in genes involved in the development and function of immune cells. To determine the gene not involved in SCID, we need to identify the genes associated with SCID. A. BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) is a gene associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which is a type of SCID. B. ZAP70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70) is a gene associated with a form of SCID called ZAP70 deficiency. C. IL2RG (Interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain) is a gene associated with X-linked SCID, which is the most common form of SCID. D. JAK3 (Janus kinase 3) is a gene associated with autosomal recessive SCID. Based on this information, the gene not involved in SCID is A. BTK.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
