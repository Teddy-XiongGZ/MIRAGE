    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the minimum number of lobes required to form a permanent tooth, we need to consider the different types of permanent teeth. There are four types of permanent teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Incisors and canines have a single lobe, so they require a minimum of 1 lobe. Premolars have two lobes, so they require a minimum of 2 lobes. Molars have three or more lobes, so they require a minimum of 3 lobes. Therefore, the minimum number of lobes required to form a permanent tooth is 1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
