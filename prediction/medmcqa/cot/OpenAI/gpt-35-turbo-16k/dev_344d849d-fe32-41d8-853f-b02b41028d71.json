    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of well-defined bald patches with no scarring and small broken hairs in the surrounding area suggests a diagnosis of alopecia areata. Androgenetic alopecia typically presents with a gradual thinning of hair in a specific pattern, usually starting at the temples or crown. Anagen effluvium is characterized by the sudden loss of hair due to damage to the hair follicles during the anagen (growth) phase. Telogen effluvium is characterized by the excessive shedding of hair due to a disruption in the hair growth cycle. Neither of these conditions present with well-defined bald patches. Therefore, the likely diagnosis in this case is B. Alopecia areata.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
