    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The treatment of choice for stage III maxillary sinus cancer (T3 No Mo) depends on several factors including the extent of the tumor and the patient's overall health. In general, the main treatment options for maxillary sinus cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. For stage III maxillary sinus cancer, which is locally advanced but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant sites (No Mo), the standard treatment approach is typically a combination of surgery and radiation therapy. This is because surgery aims to remove the tumor and any involved nearby structures, while radiation therapy helps to kill any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. Chemotherapy may also be used in some cases, either before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) to shrink the tumor and make it more operable, or after surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy) to kill any remaining cancer cells. However, chemotherapy alone is not usually considered the primary treatment for stage III maxillary sinus cancer. Based on this information, the most appropriate treatment choice for stage III maxillary sinus cancer (T3 No Mo) would be B. Surgery + Radiotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
