    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gait apraxia refers to the inability to perform coordinated movements while walking. It is commonly seen in conditions affecting the frontal lobes of the brain. Thromboembolic episodes involve the formation of blood clots that can block blood vessels. To determine which blood vessel is involved in gait apraxia, we need to consider the location of the frontal lobes and the blood supply to this area. The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) supplies the medial aspects of the frontal lobes, while the middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies the lateral aspects. The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) supplies the occipital lobes and the posterior choroidal artery supplies the choroid plexus. Since gait apraxia is associated with frontal lobe dysfunction, the most likely vessel involved in this condition would be the ACA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
