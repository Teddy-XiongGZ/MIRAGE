    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The probable reasons for a high incidence of dental caries in the teenage population can be analyzed step-by-step as follows: 1. Rapid growth (Option A): Rapid growth during teenage years can lead to increased nutritional needs, including a higher intake of carbohydrates. However, rapid growth alone is not the most direct reason for dental caries. 2. Frequency of sucrose intake (Option B): Sucrose is a type of sugar that is commonly found in many foods and beverages. High consumption of sucrose can contribute to the development of dental caries as it provides a food source for bacteria in the mouth, leading to acid production and tooth decay. This is a more direct reason for dental caries. 3. Negligence in visiting the dentist (Option C): Negligence in visiting the dentist can contribute to the development of dental caries as regular dental check-ups and cleanings are important for early detection and prevention of tooth decay. However, this is not the most direct reason for dental caries. 4. Carelessness in oral hygiene habits (Option D): Poor oral hygiene habits, such as inadequate brushing and flossing, can allow plaque to build up on the teeth, leading to dental caries. This is a more direct reason for dental caries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Frequency of sucrose intake\"}"
