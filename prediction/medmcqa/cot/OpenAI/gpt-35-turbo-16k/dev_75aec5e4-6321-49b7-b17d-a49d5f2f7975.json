    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the value of ANB in a skeletal Class III, we need to understand what ANB represents. ANB is a cephalometric measurement that assesses the relationship between the maxilla (A point) and the mandible (B point) in relation to the cranial base (N point). In a skeletal Class III, the mandible is positioned more anteriorly compared to the maxilla, resulting in a negative ANB value. Therefore, the correct answer is A. -10.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
