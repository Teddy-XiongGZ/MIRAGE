    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the angles between adhesive and adherent are zero degrees, it indicates that the adherent and adhesive molecules are tangent to each other. This means that the adhesive is in direct contact with the adherent, resulting in complete wetting of the surfaces. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Adherent and adhesive molecules are tangent to each other.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
