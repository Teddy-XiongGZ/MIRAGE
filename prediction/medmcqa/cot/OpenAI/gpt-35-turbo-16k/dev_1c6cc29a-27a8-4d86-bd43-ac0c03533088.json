    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which type of OKC is more aggressive and has more recurrence potential, we need to consider the characteristics of each type. \\n\\n1. Orthokeratinized OKC: This type of OKC is characterized by the presence of fully matured keratinized epithelium. It is generally considered less aggressive and has a lower recurrence potential compared to other types of OKC.\\n\\n2. Parakeratinized OKC: This type of OKC is characterized by the presence of partially matured keratinized epithelium. It is considered more aggressive and has a higher recurrence potential compared to orthokeratinized OKC.\\n\\n3. Non-keratinized OKC: This type of OKC is characterized by the absence of keratinized epithelium. It is generally considered less aggressive and has a lower recurrence potential compared to parakeratinized OKC.\\n\\nBased on this information, the answer is B. Parakeratinized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
