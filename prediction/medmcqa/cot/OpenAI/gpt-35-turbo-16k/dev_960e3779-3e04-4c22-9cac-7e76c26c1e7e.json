It is characterized by symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. To prevent AMS, a drug called acetazolamide is commonly used. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that helps to increase ventilation and reduce the risk of AMS. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat AMS symptoms but is not typically used for prevention. Digoxin is a medication used to treat heart conditions, and diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
