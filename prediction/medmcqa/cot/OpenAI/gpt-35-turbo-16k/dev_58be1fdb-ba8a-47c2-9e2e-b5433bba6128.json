    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mental foramen is a small opening located on the lower jaw, specifically on the mandible. It is an exit point for the mental nerve, which provides sensation to the lower lip and chin. To determine its location, we can consider the anatomy of the mandible. The premolars and molars are located towards the back of the mouth, while the incisors and canines are towards the front.
