    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Surveyor is a dental instrument used to evaluate the contours and relationships of teeth and other oral structures. It is commonly used on master casts to aid in the fabrication of removable dental prostheses. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Locate guiding planes: Guiding planes are specific areas on the teeth that help guide the insertion and removal of a removable dental prosthesis. While a surveyor can help identify these areas, it is not its primary purpose.\\n\\nB. Determine aesthetics: Aesthetics refers to the appearance of the prosthesis. While a surveyor can help evaluate the contours and relationships of teeth, it is not primarily used to determine aesthetics.\\n\\nC. Delineate areas of maximum convexity: This refers to identifying the areas on the teeth or oral structures that have the greatest outward curvature. A surveyor can help identify these areas by evaluating the contours and relationships of the teeth.\\n\\nD. Locate undercuts to be used for retention or to be blocked out: Undercuts are areas on the teeth or oral structures where the prosthesis can engage for retention. A surveyor is commonly used to locate and measure these undercuts, making this the most appropriate answer choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
