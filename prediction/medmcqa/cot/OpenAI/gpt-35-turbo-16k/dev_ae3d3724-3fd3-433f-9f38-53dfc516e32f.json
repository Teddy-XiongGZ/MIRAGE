    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At resting membrane potential (RMP), there is no net electrogenic transfer, which means that the total positive charge inside the cell is equal to the total positive charge outside the cell. Since V=-30, we can assume that the total positive charge inside the cell is 30 units greater than the total positive charge outside the cell. Since X, Y, and Z are the ions inside the cell, and V=-30, we can conclude that Z must be -30.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. -80\"}"
