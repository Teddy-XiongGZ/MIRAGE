    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Finishing and polishing of amalgam restoration involves the removal of excess material and the creation of a smooth surface. This process helps to improve the aesthetics of the restoration and also has several functional benefits. Option A: Increase in tarnish and corrosion resistance - Finishing and polishing of amalgam restoration does not directly increase the tarnish and corrosion resistance. In fact, if the amalgam restoration is not properly finished and polished, it can lead to rough surfaces that are more prone to tarnish and corrosion. Option B: Increase the marginal strength - Marginal strength refers to the strength of the amalgam at the margins or edges of the restoration. While finishing and polishing can help to improve the marginal adaptation of the restoration, it does not directly increase the marginal strength. Option C: Decrease the tarnish and corrosion resistance - As mentioned earlier, finishing and polishing of amalgam restoration does not directly decrease the tarnish and corrosion resistance. In fact, a properly finished and polished restoration can help to reduce the risk of tarnish and corrosion by creating a smooth surface that is easier to clean and maintain. Option D: Increased compressive strength - Compressive strength refers to the ability of the amalgam restoration to withstand compressive forces. Finishing and polishing do not directly increase the compressive strength of the restoration. Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is option C. Finishing and polishing of amalgam restoration helps to decrease the tarnish and corrosion resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
