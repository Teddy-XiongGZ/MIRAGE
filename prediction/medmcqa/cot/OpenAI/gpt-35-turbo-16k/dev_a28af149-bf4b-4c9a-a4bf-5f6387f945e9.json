    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the patient has had a massive hemorrhage and requires large amounts of fluids. The choice of IV cannula will depend on the size of the cannula and the flow rate it can accommodate. Larger cannulas have a larger diameter and can accommodate a higher flow rate. Therefore, the preferred choice would be a cannula with a larger size. Let's analyze the options: \\n\\nA. Grey: Grey cannulas are typically 14G, which is larger than the standard 18G cannula. \\nB. Green: Green cannulas are typically 16G, which is smaller than the grey cannula. \\nC. Blue: Blue cannulas are typically 18G, which is smaller than both the grey and green cannulas. \\nD. Pink: Pink cannulas are typically 20G, which is the smallest size among the options. \\n\\nBased on the analysis, the preferred choice of IV cannula would be the largest size available, which is the grey cannula (option A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
