    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The buccopharyngeal membrane is a temporary structure that forms during embryonic development. It is located in the region where the oral cavity and pharynx will eventually form. To determine its composition, we need to consider the germ layers involved in the development of these structures. The ectoderm gives rise to the outermost layer of the skin and nervous system, while the endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract and respiratory system. The mesoderm gives rise to the connective tissues, muscles, and other structures. Based on this information, the buccopharyngeal membrane is composed of both ectoderm and endoderm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Both AB\"}"
