The high levels of serum bilirubin (28.8 mg/dL) and liver enzymes (AST = 1063, ALT = 1191) indicate liver dysfunction. The viral markers show reactive Anti-HEV IgM and non-reactive Anti-HEV IgG, suggesting acute hepatitis E infection. The absence of reactive Anti-HBc IgM and non-reactive Anti-HBc IgG rules out acute hepatitis B infection. The absence of reactive Anti-HAV IgM and reactive Anti-HAV IgG rules out acute hepatitis A infection. Therefore, the likely diagnosis is D.
