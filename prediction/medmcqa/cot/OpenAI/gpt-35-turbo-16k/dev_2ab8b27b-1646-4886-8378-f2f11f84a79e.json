    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Coagulation necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs due to protein denaturation and precipitation. It is typically seen with strong acids. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. HC1: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and can cause coagulation necrosis on contact.\\nB. H2SO4: Sulfuric acid is also a strong acid and can cause coagulation necrosis on contact.\\nC. HF: Hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid and does not typically cause coagulation necrosis on contact.\\nD. HNO3: Nitric acid is a strong acid and can cause coagulation necrosis on contact.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the acid that does not show coagulation necrosis on contact is HF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
