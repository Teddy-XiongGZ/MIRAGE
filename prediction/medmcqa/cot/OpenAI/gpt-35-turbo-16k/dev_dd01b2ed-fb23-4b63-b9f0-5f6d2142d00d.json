    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maxillary first molars typically have three roots: mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and palatal. The mesiobuccal root is the largest and most commonly present. The distobuccal root is usually present but can be absent in some cases. The palatal root is always present. Therefore, the fourth root canal, if present, is usually found in the mesiobuccal root.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mesiobuccal\"}"
