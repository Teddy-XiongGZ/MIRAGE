    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Microvilli are tiny, finger-like projections found on the surface of certain cells. They increase the surface area of the cell, allowing for more efficient absorption and secretion. To determine which of the given options do not have microvilli, we need to consider the locations where microvilli are typically found. Microvilli are commonly found in the small intestine, where they aid in the absorption of nutrients. They are also present in the proximal convoluted tubule of the nephron, where they assist in reabsorption of substances from the filtrate. However, microvilli are not typically found in the gallbladder or the collecting duct. The gallbladder is responsible for storing and concentrating bile, while the collecting duct is involved in the final concentration of urine. Therefore, the answer is A. Gallbladder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
