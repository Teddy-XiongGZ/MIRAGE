    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Selenocysteine is a rare amino acid that is encoded by a specific codon. To determine the codon for selenocysteine, we need to refer to the genetic code. The genetic code is a set of rules that determines how the sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA is translated into the sequence of amino acids in a protein. Looking at the genetic code, we can see that the codon for selenocysteine is UGA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. UGA\"}"
