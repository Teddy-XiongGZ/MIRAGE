    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic system. The orbit refers to the eye socket. To determine the most common type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the orbit, we need to consider the different types of lymphocytes that can be involved. The lymphocytes involved in lymphoma can be B-cells, T-cells, NK-cells, or plasma cells. B-cell lymphomas are the most common type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall, but the specific type in the orbit may differ. To answer the question, we need to consider the lymphocytes commonly found in the orbit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
