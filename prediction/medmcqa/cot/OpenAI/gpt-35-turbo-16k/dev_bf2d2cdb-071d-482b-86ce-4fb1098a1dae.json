    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which muscles are elevators of the mandible, we need to understand the anatomy and function of each muscle. The mandible is the lower jawbone, and elevators of the mandible are responsible for raising the jaw. Let's analyze each muscle:\\n\\nA. Digastric: The digastric muscle has two bellies and helps in opening the mouth and depressing the mandible. It is not primarily an elevator of the mandible.\\n\\nB. Masseter: The masseter muscle is a powerful muscle that elevates the mandible during chewing. It is one of the main elevators of the mandible.\\n\\nC. Medial pterygoid: The medial pterygoid muscle is also involved in elevating the mandible during chewing. It is another important elevator of the mandible.\\n\\nD. Temporalis: The temporalis muscle is a large muscle that plays a significant role in elevating the mandible. It is one of the main elevators of the mandible.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the muscle that is NOT an elevator of the mandible is the digastric muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
