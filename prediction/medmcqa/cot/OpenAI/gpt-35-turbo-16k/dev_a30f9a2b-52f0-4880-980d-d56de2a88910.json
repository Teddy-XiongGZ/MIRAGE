    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In acute shock, the goal is to increase blood pressure and improve organ perfusion. Dopamine is commonly used in the management of acute shock. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not helpful in acute shock:\\n\\nA. Alpha-1 agonist action leading to peripheral vasoconstriction: This action of dopamine helps to increase systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, which is beneficial in acute shock.\\n\\nB. Increase in renal perfusion due to agonist action on DI receptors: Dopamine's agonist action on DI receptors leads to renal vasodilation and increased renal perfusion, which is beneficial in acute shock.\\n\\nC. Releases noradrenaline and causes positive inotropic effect: Dopamine's ability to release noradrenaline and cause a positive inotropic effect helps to increase cardiac output and improve tissue perfusion, which is beneficial in acute shock.\\n\\nD. Direct action on heart beta-1 receptors: Dopamine's direct action on heart beta-1 receptors leads to increased myocardial contractility and cardiac output, which is beneficial in acute shock.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, all of the mentioned properties of dopamine are helpful in acute shock. Therefore, the answer is none of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
