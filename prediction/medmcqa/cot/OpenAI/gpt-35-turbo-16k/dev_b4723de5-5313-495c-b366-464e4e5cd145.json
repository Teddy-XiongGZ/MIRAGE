    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mechanism of adhesion of GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) restoration with the tooth surface is by means of a chemical bond. GIC contains carboxyl groups in its structure, which can form ionic bonds with the calcium ions present in the tooth structure. This interaction between the carboxyl groups in GIC and the calcium ions in the tooth surface is responsible for the adhesion. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Carboxyl group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
