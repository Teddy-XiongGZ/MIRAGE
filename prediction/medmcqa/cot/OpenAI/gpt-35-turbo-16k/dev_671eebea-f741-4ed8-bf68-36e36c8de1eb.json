    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Noise-induced hearing loss is a type of sensorineural hearing loss that occurs due to damage to the hair cells in the inner ear. The hair cells are responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. When exposed to loud noises, the hair cells can become damaged or destroyed, leading to hearing loss. The inner hair cells are primarily responsible for transmitting sound information to the brain, while the outer hair cells help amplify and fine-tune the sound signals. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Inner hair cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
