    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's analyze each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Latanoprost is used with caution in patients of bronchial asthma: Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog used to treat glaucoma. It works by reducing intraocular pressure. There is no known contraindication or caution for using latanoprost in patients with bronchial asthma. Therefore, option A is not true.\\n\\nB. Topiramate can cause bilateral angle closure glaucoma: Topiramate is an antiepileptic medication that can cause acute angle closure glaucoma as a side effect. However, it is not typically bilateral. Therefore, option B is not true.\\n\\nC. Methazolamide causes decrease in ocular blood flow: Methazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to reduce intraocular pressure. It does not cause a decrease in ocular blood flow. Therefore, option C is not true.\\n\\nD. Central scotoma is seen in open angle glaucoma: Open angle glaucoma is a chronic condition characterized by gradual loss of peripheral vision. Central scotoma, which is a blind spot in the center of the visual field, is not typically seen in open angle glaucoma. Therefore, option D is not true.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, none of the options are true.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
