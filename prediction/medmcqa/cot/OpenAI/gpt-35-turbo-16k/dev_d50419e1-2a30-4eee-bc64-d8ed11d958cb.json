    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presentation of recurrent chest infections in a 4-year-old boy along with abnormal sweat chloride test values suggests the possibility of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder characterized by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. To confirm the diagnosis of CF, further investigations are required. The next best investigation to confirm the diagnosis is DNA analysis of the delta F 508 mutation. Delta F 508 is the most common mutation in the CFTR gene, accounting for approximately 70% of CF cases. Therefore, the answer choice is D. DNA analysis of delta F 508 mutation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
