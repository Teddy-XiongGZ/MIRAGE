    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glazing of the layer crack is seen because of thermal shock. Thermal shock occurs when there is a rapid change in temperature, causing the material to expand or contract quickly. This sudden change in temperature can lead to cracking or glazing of the layer. Contamination and incompatibility may also contribute to cracking, but thermal shock is the most likely cause in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
