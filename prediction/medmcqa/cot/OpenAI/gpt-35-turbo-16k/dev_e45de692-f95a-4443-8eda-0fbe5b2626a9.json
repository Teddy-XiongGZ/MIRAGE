    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reichert's cartilage is a specific type of cartilage that develops during embryonic development. To determine which arch it belongs to, we need to understand the development of the pharyngeal arches. The pharyngeal arches are a series of structures that form in the developing embryo and give rise to various structures in the head and neck. The first arch gives rise to structures such as the maxilla and mandible, while the second arch gives rise to structures such as the hyoid bone. The third and fourth arches give rise to structures such as the hyoid bone and laryngeal cartilages. Based on this information, Reichert's cartilage is most likely associated with the second arch.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
