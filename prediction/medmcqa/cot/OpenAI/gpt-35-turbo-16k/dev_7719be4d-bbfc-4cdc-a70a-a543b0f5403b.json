    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RVG stands for Radiovisiography, which is a digital imaging system used in dentistry. It is used to capture dental radiographs. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. 80% reduction of patient exposure: This statement is true. RVG uses digital sensors that require less radiation exposure compared to traditional film-based radiographs.\\n\\nB. Instant imaging: This statement is true. RVG provides instant imaging, allowing dentists to view the radiographs immediately.\\n\\nC. Easy to storage and retrieval: This statement is true. RVG images are stored digitally, making it easier to store and retrieve compared to physical film-based radiographs.\\n\\nD. Image is sharper than caused by halogen halide: This statement is not true. RVG images may not necessarily be sharper than those caused by halogen halide. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
