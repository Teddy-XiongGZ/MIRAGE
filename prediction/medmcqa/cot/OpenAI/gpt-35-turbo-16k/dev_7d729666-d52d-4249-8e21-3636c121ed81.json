    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nickel is added to wrought gold alloys for specific purposes. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Strengthener: Nickel can indeed increase the strength of gold alloys, so this is a possible answer.\\nB. Hardener: Nickel can also increase the hardness of gold alloys, so this is another possible answer.\\nC. Whitens the alloy: Nickel does not have a whitening effect on gold alloys, so this option is unlikely.\\nD. Scavenger: Nickel is not typically added as a scavenger in gold alloys, so this option is unlikely as well.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the most appropriate answer is either A. Strengthener or B. Hardener.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
