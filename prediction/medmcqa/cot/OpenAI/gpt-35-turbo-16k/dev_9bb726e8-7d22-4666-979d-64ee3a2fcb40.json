    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To check the mean of values, we need to use statistical tests that are specifically designed for this purpose. The chi-square test is used to analyze categorical data, not continuous data like means. Student's analysis, also known as the t-test, is used to compare means between two groups, but it is not used to calculate the mean itself.
