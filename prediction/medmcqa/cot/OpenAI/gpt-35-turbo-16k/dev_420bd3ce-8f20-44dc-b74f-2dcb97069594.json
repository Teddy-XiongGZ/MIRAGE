    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When it comes to brushing technique for gingival recession, there are several options to consider. Let's go through each choice and evaluate them one by one. \\n\\nA. Bass technique: The Bass technique is a widely recommended brushing technique that involves placing the bristles at a 45-degree angle to the gumline and making small circular motions. While this technique is effective for overall oral hygiene, it may not be the best choice for gingival recession as it can potentially cause further damage to the already receded gums.\\n\\nB. Stillman technique: The Stillman technique is another commonly used brushing technique. It involves placing the bristles at a 45-degree angle to the gumline and using a vibrating or rolling motion to clean the teeth and gums. This technique can be effective for gingival recession as it helps stimulate blood flow to the gums and promote healing.\\n\\nC. Charter technique: The Charter technique is a brushing technique that involves placing the bristles at a 45-degree angle to the gumline and using a sweeping motion to clean the teeth and gums. While this technique can be effective for overall oral hygiene, it may not be the best choice for gingival recession as it does not provide as much stimulation to the gums as the Stillman technique.\\n\\nD. Modified Stillman technique: The Modified Stillman technique is a variation of the Stillman technique that involves placing the bristles at a 45-degree angle to the gumline and using a vibrating or rolling motion to clean the teeth and gums, followed by a sweeping motion to remove any remaining plaque. This technique combines the benefits of the Stillman technique with the added benefit of removing plaque more effectively. Therefore, the Modified Stillman technique is the most suitable brushing technique for gingival recession.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
