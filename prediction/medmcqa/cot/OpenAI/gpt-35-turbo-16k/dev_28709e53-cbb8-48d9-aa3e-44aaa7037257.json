    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the mortality associated with emergency abdominal aortic surgery. To determine the answer, we need to consider the mortality rates for this type of surgery. Emergency abdominal aortic surgery is a high-risk procedure due to the urgency and complexity involved. The mortality rate can vary depending on several factors, including the patient's overall health, the specific condition being treated, and the expertise of the surgical team. However, in general, the mortality rate for emergency abdominal aortic surgery is higher than for elective procedures. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A and B, as they represent lower mortality rates. Option D, '>50%', is a possibility, as emergency surgeries often have higher mortality rates. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact mortality rate. Option C, '40%', seems like a reasonable choice, as it represents a higher mortality rate but is not as extreme as option D. Therefore, the answer is C. 40%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
