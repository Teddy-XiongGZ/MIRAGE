    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process that occurs in multicellular organisms. It is characterized by several distinct features. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. No inflammation: This is true about apoptosis. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis does not trigger an inflammatory response.\\n\\nB. Plasma membrane intact: This is false about apoptosis. During apoptosis, the plasma membrane undergoes changes such as blebbing and budding, leading to the formation of apoptotic bodies.\\n\\nC. Organelle swelling: This is false about apoptosis. In apoptosis, organelles do not swell but undergo specific changes, such as condensation of the nucleus and fragmentation of the DNA.\\n\\nD. Affected by dedicated genes: This is true about apoptosis. Apoptosis is regulated by a complex network of genes and signaling pathways.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the false statement about apoptosis is option B. Plasma membrane intact.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
