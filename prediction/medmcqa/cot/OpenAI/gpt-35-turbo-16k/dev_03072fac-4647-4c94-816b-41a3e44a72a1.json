    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The process of calcification refers to the hardening of the tooth structure as a result of mineral deposition. In deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, calcification occurs during tooth development. The calcification of the roots of deciduous teeth starts after the crown formation is complete. The roots continue to develop and calcify until the tooth is fully formed. Typically, the calcification of the roots of deciduous teeth is completed by the time the tooth erupts into the mouth. The eruption of deciduous teeth usually begins around 6 months of age and is completed by around 2-3 years of age. Therefore, the calcification of the roots of deciduous teeth is generally completed by 2-3 years of age.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
