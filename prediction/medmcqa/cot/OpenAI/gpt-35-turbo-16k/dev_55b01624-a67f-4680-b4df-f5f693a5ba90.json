    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When the length of a spring is doubled, the effect on the spring constant is that it remains the same. The spring constant is a measure of how stiff the spring is, and it is determined by the material and the shape of the spring, not its length. Therefore, the effect on the length of the spring is independent of the spring constant. As a result, the effect on the length of the spring is simply that it is doubled. So, the answer is A. Doubled.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
