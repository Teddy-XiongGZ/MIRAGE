    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, including the heart valves. It is most commonly seen in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions or structural abnormalities that increase the risk of infection. Among the given choices, ASD (Atrial Septal Defect), VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect), and PDA (Patent Ductus Arteriosus) are all congenital heart defects that involve abnormal connections between the chambers or blood vessels of the heart. These abnormalities can create turbulent blood flow and increase the risk of bacterial colonization and infection. Pulmonary stenosis, on the other hand, is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve or artery, which does not directly increase the risk of infective endocarditis. Therefore, the most likely answer is either A. ASD, B. VSD, or C. PDA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B/C\"}"
