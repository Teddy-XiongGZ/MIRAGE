    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cross-linking fixatives are used to preserve tissue samples by forming covalent bonds between proteins and other macromolecules, thereby stabilizing the tissue structure. Osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, and formaldehyde are commonly used cross-linking fixatives. Methanol, on the other hand, is not a cross-linking fixative. It is primarily used as a dehydration agent in histological processing. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Methanol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
