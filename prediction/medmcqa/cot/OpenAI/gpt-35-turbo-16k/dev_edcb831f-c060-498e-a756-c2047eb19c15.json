    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that causes the growth of noncancerous tumors in various organs, including the brain. Neuroimaging of patients with tuberous sclerosis typically reveals certain characteristic findings. A. White matter lesions: These are commonly seen in neuroimaging of patients with tuberous sclerosis. These lesions are typically hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. B. Ependymoma: Ependymomas are not typically associated with tuberous sclerosis. Ependymomas are primary brain tumors that arise from the ependymal cells lining the ventricles of the brain or the central canal of the spinal cord. They are not specific to tuberous sclerosis. C. Subependymal nodules: These are one of the hallmark findings of tuberous sclerosis. Subependymal nodules are small, noncancerous growths that develop along the walls of the ventricles in the brain. They are typically hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images. D. Giant cell astrocytoma: Giant cell astrocytomas are another characteristic finding in neuroimaging of patients with tuberous sclerosis. These tumors are typically located in the subependymal region and are often associated with subependymal nodules. Based on the above information, the answer is B. Ependymoma, as it is not typically seen in neuroimaging of patients with tuberous sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
