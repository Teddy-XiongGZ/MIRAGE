    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Indirect ophthalmoscopy is a technique used to examine the retina and other structures at the back of the eye. It involves using a light source and a convex lens to view the image formed by the light reflected from the eye. The examiner holds the lens in front of their own eye and directs the light onto the patient's eye. The examiner then views the magnified and inverted image of the patient's retina. A. Convex lens is used: This statement is true. In indirect ophthalmoscopy, a convex lens is used to focus the light and form an image of the patient's retina. B. Image is visual and erect: This statement is false. In indirect ophthalmoscopy, the image formed is magnified and inverted, not erect. C. Magnification is 4-5 times: This statement is true. Indirect ophthalmoscopy provides a magnification of approximately 4-5 times. D. It is so bright that regular haziness is penetrated: This statement is false. Indirect ophthalmoscopy does not provide a very bright illumination, and regular haziness may not be penetrated easily. Based on the above analysis, the false statement about indirect ophthalmoscopy is B. Image is visual and erect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
