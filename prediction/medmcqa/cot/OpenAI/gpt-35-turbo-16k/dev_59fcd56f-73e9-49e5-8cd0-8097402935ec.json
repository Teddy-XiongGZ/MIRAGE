    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Immunologically active cells are cells that play a role in the immune response. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Plasma cells: Plasma cells are a type of B lymphocyte that produce and secrete antibodies. They are involved in the humoral immune response and are considered immunologically active cells.\\n\\nB. MAST cells: Mast cells are involved in allergic reactions and release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. While they play a role in the immune response, they are not typically considered immunologically active cells.\\n\\nC. Eosinophils: Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are involved in allergic reactions and defense against parasites. They release toxic substances to kill pathogens. Eosinophils are considered immunologically active cells.\\n\\nD. R.B.C s: Red blood cells (RBCs) do not have a nucleus and do not play a direct role in the immune response. They are responsible for carrying oxygen to tissues. RBCs are not considered immunologically active cells.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the immunologically active cells among the given options are A. Plasma cells and C. Eosinophils.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
