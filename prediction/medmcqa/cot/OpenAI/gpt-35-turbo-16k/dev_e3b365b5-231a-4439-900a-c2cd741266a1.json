    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hyper-extension of the 4th and 5th metacarpophalangeal joint with flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint suggests a specific pattern of hand deformity known as the 'ulnar claw hand'. This deformity is caused by the injury to the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve innervates the muscles responsible for flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint and extension at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the 4th and 5th fingers. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Deep branch of ulnar nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
