    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in this situation is to ensure the patient's airway is clear and they are breathing. Since the patient is breathing but not responsive, the next step would be to recline the chair to a supine position to improve blood flow to the brain. Shouting for help and giving oxygen is also important to ensure the patient receives immediate assistance and adequate oxygenation.
