    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which device works on the traction principle, we need to understand what traction principle means in the context of medical devices. Traction is a technique used to apply a pulling force to a body part, typically to treat fractures, dislocations, or spinal conditions. It involves the use of weights, pulleys, and ropes to create the pulling force. Now, let's analyze each device:\\n\\nA. Ferrier double bow separator: This device is used to separate the jaws during dental procedures. It does not involve the application of a pulling force, so it does not work on the traction principle.\\n\\nB. Elliot separator: This device is used to separate the eyelids during ophthalmic procedures. It also does not involve the application of a pulling force, so it does not work on the traction principle.\\n\\nC. Perry separator: This device is used to separate the jaws during dental procedures. Similar to the Ferrier double bow separator, it does not involve the application of a pulling force, so it does not work on the traction principle.\\n\\nD. None: This option suggests that none of the devices listed work on the traction principle. However, based on the analysis of the previous options, it is clear that the correct answer is D. None.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
