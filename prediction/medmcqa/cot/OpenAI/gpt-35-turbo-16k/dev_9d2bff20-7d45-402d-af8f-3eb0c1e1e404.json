    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium iodide symporter is a protein responsible for the transport of iodide ions into the cells. It is primarily found in the thyroid gland, where it plays a crucial role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. The pituitary gland is not involved in iodide transport, so it is unlikely to have sodium iodide symporter. The placenta is also not involved in iodide transport. The parotid gland is responsible for producing saliva and does not have a direct role in iodide transport. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Thyroid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
