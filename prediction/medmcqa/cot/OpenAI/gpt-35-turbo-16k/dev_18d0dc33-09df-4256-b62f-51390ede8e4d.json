    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 50-year-old male presenting with ptosis, difficulty in chewing, and occasional difficulty in swallowing. There is no history of diplopia or visual loss. On examination, there is symmetric ptosis and mild restriction of extraocular muscle movement with finger abduction test 60deg. Nerve conduction study shows decremental response in orbicularis only. ERG revealed a myopathic pattern. Anti-AchR radioimmunoassay was negative. Based on these findings, the most probable diagnosis would be ocular myasthenia gravis (choice A). Ocular myasthenia gravis typically presents with ptosis and extraocular muscle weakness, without involvement of other muscle groups. The negative anti-AchR radioimmunoassay does not rule out the diagnosis, as it can be negative in up to 50% of ocular myasthenia gravis cases. Generalized myasthenia gravis (choice B) would involve weakness in other muscle groups as well, which is not seen in this patient. Considering an alternative diagnosis (choice C) would not be appropriate based on the clinical presentation and findings. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) (choice D) typically presents with progressive ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, but without the associated extraocular muscle weakness seen in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
