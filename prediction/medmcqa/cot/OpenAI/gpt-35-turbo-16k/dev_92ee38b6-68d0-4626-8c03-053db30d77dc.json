    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sudden death in a patient with an acute myocardial infarction is most commonly due to ventricular fibrillation. During an acute myocardial infarction, there is a disruption in the blood supply to the heart muscle, leading to ischemia and subsequent damage. This damage can cause abnormal electrical activity in the heart, leading to ventricular fibrillation, which is a life-threatening arrhythmia. Aortic dissection, atrial fibrillation, and cardiac tamponade can also occur in patients with acute myocardial infarction, but they are not the most common causes of sudden death in this setting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
