    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Basophils are a type of white blood cell that play a role in allergic reactions and immune responses. To determine what activates basophils, we can consider the potential choices provided. A. IL-5: Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a cytokine that is involved in the production and activation of eosinophils, another type of white blood cell. While IL-5 can indirectly affect basophils by promoting eosinophil activation, it is not a direct activator of basophils. B. Neutrophils: Neutrophils are a different type of white blood cell that are involved in the immune response to bacterial infections. They do not directly activate basophils. C. Killer inhibitory peptide: There is no known direct relationship between killer inhibitory peptides and the activation of basophils. D. Cell fixed Ig E: Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody that plays a central role in allergic reactions. When IgE binds to basophils or mast cells, it can trigger the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which leads to the activation of basophils. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Cell fixed Ig E, as it directly activates basophils.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
