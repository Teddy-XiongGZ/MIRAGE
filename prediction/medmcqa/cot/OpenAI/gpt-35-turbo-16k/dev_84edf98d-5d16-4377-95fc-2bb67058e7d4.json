    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When horse serum is injected intravenously in to a rabbit, it can lead to the production of specific antibodies against the horse serum. These antibodies can then circulate in the blood and bind to the horse serum antigens. When the horse serum is injected again into the skin two or three weeks later, the antibodies that have been produced in response to the previous injection can bind to the horse serum antigens at the site of injection. This binding triggers an immune response, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. This type of reaction is known as the Arthus phenomenon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Arthus phenomenon\"}"
