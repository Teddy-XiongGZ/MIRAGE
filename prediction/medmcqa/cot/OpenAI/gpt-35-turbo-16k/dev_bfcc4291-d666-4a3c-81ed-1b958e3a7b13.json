    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the terms used. A 'cut back' incision refers to making an incision on a laterally displaced flap. The term 'mesial' refers to the direction towards the midline or center of the dental arch, while 'distal' refers to the direction away from the midline or center. The 'donor site' refers to the area from which the flap was displaced, and the 'recipient site' refers to the area where the flap was moved to. In this case, since the incision is made on a laterally displaced flap, we need to determine the direction of the cut back incision. If we want to bring the flap back towards the donor site, we would need to make a cut in the direction opposite to the displacement. Therefore, the correct answer would be B. Distal cut toward the donor site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
