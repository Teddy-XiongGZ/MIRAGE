    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's analyze each statement one by one to determine which one is not true about glomerular capillaries. \\n\\nA. The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it: This statement is true. The oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries is higher than that of the fluid entering it, as proteins are not filtered through the glomerular filtration barrier.\\n\\nB. Glucose concentration in the capillaries is the same as that in glomerular filtrate: This statement is true. Glucose is freely filtered through the glomerular filtration barrier, so the concentration of glucose in the capillaries is the same as that in the glomerular filtrate.\\n\\nC. Constriction of afferent arteriole decreases the blood flow to the glomerulus: This statement is true. Constriction of the afferent arteriole reduces the blood flow into the glomerulus, leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate.\\n\\nD. Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of the fluid entering it: This statement is not true. The hematocrit of the fluid leaving the glomerular capillaries is higher than that of the fluid entering it. This is because during glomerular filtration, a larger proportion of plasma is filtered out, leaving behind a higher concentration of red blood cells in the remaining fluid. \\n\\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is not true about glomerular capillaries is D. Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of the fluid entering it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
