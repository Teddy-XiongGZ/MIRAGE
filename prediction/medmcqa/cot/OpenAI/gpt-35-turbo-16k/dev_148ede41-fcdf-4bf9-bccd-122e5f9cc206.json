    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Impression compound base refers to the material used in dental impressions to create a stable and accurate mold of the patient's teeth and surrounding tissues. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Low thermal conductivity: This property is not directly related to the impression compound base.\\n\\nB. Crystalline structure: The impression compound base is typically an amorphous material, so it does not have a crystalline structure.\\n\\nC. Formation of cross linkage with heating: This is a characteristic of impression compound base. When heated, the compound undergoes cross-linking, which helps it solidify and maintain its shape.\\n\\nD. High fusion temperature: Fusion temperature refers to the temperature at which a material transitions from a solid to a liquid state. While the impression compound base does require heating for cross-linking, it does not have a particularly high fusion temperature.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Formation of cross linkage with heating.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
