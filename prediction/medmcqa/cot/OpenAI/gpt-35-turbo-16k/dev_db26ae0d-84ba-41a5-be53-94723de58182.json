    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The significant bleeding and pooling of blood in the space of Retzius during Burch operation suggests a potential injury to a blood vessel. The next step in the management should be to control the bleeding. Option A, calling a vascular surgeon, may be necessary in case of severe bleeding or if the source of bleeding cannot be controlled. Option B, giving a generalized suture in the bleeding area, may not be effective if the source of bleeding cannot be visualized. Option C, lifting the endopelvic fascia by putting fingers in the vagina, may help identify the source of bleeding and provide temporary control. Option D, placing a surgical drain, may be considered after the bleeding is controlled to prevent accumulation of blood in the surgical site. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this scenario would be option C, lifting the endopelvic fascia by putting fingers in the vagina.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
