    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A \u03b1 fibers are a type of nerve fibers that are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the skin to the brain. These fibers are myelinated, which means they have a layer of insulation called myelin around them. Myelination increases the speed of electrical conduction along the nerve fibers. The electrical conductivity speed of A \u03b1 fibers is known to be in the range of 70-120 meters per second. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 70-120.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
