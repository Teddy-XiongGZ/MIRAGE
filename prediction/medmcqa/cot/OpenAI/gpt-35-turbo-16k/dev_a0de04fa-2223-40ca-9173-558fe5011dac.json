    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hematuria refers to the presence of blood in the urine, while hypercalciuria refers to the presence of high levels of calcium in the urine. When both hematuria and hypercalciuria are present, it suggests a possible underlying kidney disorder. A. Isomorphic RBCs: Isomorphic RBCs refer to red blood cells that appear normal in shape and size. While the presence of isomorphic RBCs may indicate a urinary tract infection or kidney stone, it is not specific to hematuria and hypercalciuria. B. RBC casts: RBC casts are cylindrical structures formed by the clumping of red blood cells within the kidney tubules. The presence of RBC casts in the urine is suggestive of glomerulonephritis, a condition that can cause both hematuria and hypercalciuria. C. Nephrotic range proteinuria: Nephrotic range proteinuria refers to the presence of high levels of protein in the urine. While glomerulonephritis can cause both hematuria and proteinuria, hypercalciuria is not typically associated with nephrotic range proteinuria. D. Eosinophiluria: Eosinophiluria refers to the presence of eosinophils in the urine. It is typically seen in conditions such as interstitial nephritis or allergic reactions. While eosinophiluria can cause hematuria, it is not specifically associated with hypercalciuria. Based on the information provided, the most likely finding on urine analysis of a patient with hematuria and hypercalciuria is B. RBC casts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
