    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is true regarding H1N1 Influenza, we need to evaluate each option. Option A states that pregnant women with a sore throat can be started immediately on oseltamivir without diagnostic testing under category B. This statement is not true because pregnant women with a sore throat should undergo diagnostic testing before starting any medication. Option B states that people on long-term steroids cannot receive oseltamivir. This statement is true because oseltamivir is contraindicated in individuals on long-term steroids due to the increased risk of adverse effects. Option C states that category B concerns low-risk cases. This statement is not true because category B refers to moderate-risk cases, not low-risk cases. Option D states that category B patients have to undergo immediate testing. This statement is not true because category B patients do not require immediate testing. Based on the evaluation of each option, the correct answer is B. People on long-term steroids cannot receive oseltamivir.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
