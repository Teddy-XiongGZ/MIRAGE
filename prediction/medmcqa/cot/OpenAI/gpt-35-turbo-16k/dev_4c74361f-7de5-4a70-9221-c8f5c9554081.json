    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Post solid organ transplantation, the most common infection is usually caused by the reactivation of latent viruses in the recipient's body. The most common viral infections seen in this setting include cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human papillomavirus (HPV). CMV is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients, making it a common and important infection to consider. HSV can also cause infections in transplant recipients, but it is less common than CMV. EBV is associated with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), a serious complication in transplant recipients. HPV can cause genital warts and certain types of cancer, but it is not as commonly seen as CMV, HSV, or EBV in the post-transplant setting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
