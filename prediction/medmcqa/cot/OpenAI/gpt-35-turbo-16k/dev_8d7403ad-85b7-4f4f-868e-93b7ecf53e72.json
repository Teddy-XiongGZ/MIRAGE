    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), markers are substances released into the bloodstream when there is damage to the heart muscle. These markers can be used to diagnose and monitor MI. In general, the release of markers occurs in a specific sequence. LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and CPK-MB (creatine kinase-MB) are older markers that have been largely replaced by more specific and sensitive markers like troponin T and troponin I. Troponin T and troponin I are highly specific to cardiac muscle and are released into the bloodstream when there is damage to the heart. Troponin T and troponin I are considered the gold standard markers for diagnosing MI. Given this information, the marker that would appear last in MI is troponin I.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
