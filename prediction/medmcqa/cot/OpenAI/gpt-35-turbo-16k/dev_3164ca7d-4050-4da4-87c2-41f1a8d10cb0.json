    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eburnation of the dentine refers to the hardening and polishing of the dentine surface due to friction or wear. This typically occurs in chronic conditions where there is prolonged exposure to mechanical forces. Acute caries refers to the initial stages of tooth decay and is unlikely to cause eburnation. Arrested caries refers to a condition where the progression of tooth decay has been halted. Root caries refers to decay that occurs on the root surface of the tooth. Therefore, the most likely type of lesion where eburnation of the dentine is seen is chronic caries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
