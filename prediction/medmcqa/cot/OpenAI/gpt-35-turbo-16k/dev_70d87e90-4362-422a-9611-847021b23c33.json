    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In myocardial infarction, the first enzyme to rise is typically CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase). CPK is an enzyme found predominantly in the heart muscle, brain, and skeletal muscle. During a myocardial infarction, the heart muscle is damaged, leading to the release of CPK into the bloodstream. LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) and SGOT (Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase) are also enzymes that can be elevated in myocardial infarction, but they typically rise later than CPK. Amylase, on the other hand, is an enzyme involved in the digestion of carbohydrates and is not specific to myocardial infarction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
