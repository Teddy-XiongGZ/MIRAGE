    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a patient with Tubercular meningitis who is deteriorating despite regular intake of drugs, it is important to investigate the cause of the deterioration. The options provided are MRI, NCCT, CSF examination, and liver function tests. MRI and NCCT are imaging studies that can help identify any structural abnormalities or complications in the brain.
