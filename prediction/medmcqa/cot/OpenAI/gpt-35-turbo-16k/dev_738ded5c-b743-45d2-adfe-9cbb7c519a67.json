    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Short-acting non-depolarising muscle relaxants are drugs that temporarily paralyze skeletal muscles by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction. To determine which of the options is a short-acting non-depolarising muscle relaxant, we need to consider the duration of action of each drug. Succinylcholine is a depolarising muscle relaxant and not a non-depolarising one, so it can be eliminated. Pancuronium is a long-acting non-depolarising muscle relaxant, so it can also be eliminated. Decamethonium is a depolarising muscle relaxant, so it can be eliminated as well. This leaves us with the option C, Mivacurium, which is a short-acting non-depolarising muscle relaxant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
