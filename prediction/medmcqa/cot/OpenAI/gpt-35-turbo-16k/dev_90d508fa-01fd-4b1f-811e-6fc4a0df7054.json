    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent fracture of MO amalgam, we need to consider the factors that can provide support and stability to the restoration. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Beveling of axiopulpal line angle: Beveling the line angle can help in reducing stress concentration and improving the adaptation of the restoration, but it may not directly prevent fracture.\\n\\nB. Occlusal dovetails: Dovetails can provide mechanical retention and resistance against displacement, but they may not directly prevent fracture.\\n\\nC. Pin retained amalgam: The use of pins can enhance the retention and stability of the restoration, but they may not directly prevent fracture.\\n\\nD. Removal of unsupported enamel rods: This option involves removing unsupported enamel rods to create a more stable and supported restoration, which can help prevent fracture.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the most appropriate choice to prevent fracture of MO amalgam is D. Removal of unsupported enamel rods.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
