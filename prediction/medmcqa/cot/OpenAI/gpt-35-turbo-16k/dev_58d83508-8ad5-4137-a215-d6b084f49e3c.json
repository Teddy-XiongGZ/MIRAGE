    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bone sounding is a technique used to assess the depth and quality of bone. It involves tapping or probing the bone to determine its density and integrity. In modern times, bone sounding is not typically performed using traditional methods like probing. RVG (Radiovisiography) and CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) are imaging techniques that provide detailed images of the bone, but they are not used specifically for bone sounding. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Radiovisiography.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
