    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the information provided, we have a 19-year-old patient with a swelling over the left angle of the mandible, a temperature of 38\u00b0C, and no history of trauma. Let's analyze the potential options:\\n\\nA. Spontaneous fracture of the mandible: This is unlikely as there is no history of trauma.\\n\\nB. Pericoronal infection: This is a possibility as it can cause swelling and pain around the mandibular third molars.\\n\\nC. Mumps: Mumps typically presents with bilateral swelling of the parotid glands, not specifically over the angle of the mandible.\\n\\nD. Sjogren's syndrome: Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the salivary glands and typically presents with dry eyes and dry mouth, not specifically with swelling over the angle of the mandible.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of the swelling over the left angle of the mandible in this patient is a pericoronal infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
