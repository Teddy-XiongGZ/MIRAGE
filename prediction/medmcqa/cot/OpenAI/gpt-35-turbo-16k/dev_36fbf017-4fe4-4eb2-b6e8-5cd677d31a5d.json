    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and systems in the body. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not true about SLE: A. IgA and IgG against basement of mucosa or increased collagen formation: This statement is true. In SLE, there can be production of autoantibodies, including IgA and IgG, which can target various tissues and organs. B. ROR-2 gene mutation: This statement is not typically associated with SLE. ROR-2 gene mutation is more commonly associated with skeletal disorders, such as Robinow syndrome, and not specifically with SLE. C. Complement C3 activation and fibroblast formation: This statement is true. In SLE, there can be activation of the complement system, leading to the deposition of complement C3 on tissues and organs. This can contribute to inflammation and tissue damage. Additionally, SLE can also lead to fibroblast activation and increased collagen production. D. Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test: This statement is true. ANA test is commonly used as a screening test for SLE. The presence of positive ANA is a characteristic feature of SLE, although it is not specific to this disease. Based on the above analysis, the option that is not true about SLE is B. ROR-2 gene mutation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
