    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Rapid axonal flow in neurons is mediated by molecular motors that transport various cargoes along microtubules. Dynein and kinesin are two types of molecular motors involved in axonal transport. Dynein is responsible for retrograde transport, moving cargoes towards the cell body, while kinesin is responsible for anterograde transport, moving cargoes away from the cell body. Neurofilaments, on the other hand, are intermediate filaments that provide structural support to the axon and are not directly involved in axonal transport. Microtubules, which are composed of tubulin subunits, serve as the tracks for the molecular motors to move along. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Neurofilaments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
