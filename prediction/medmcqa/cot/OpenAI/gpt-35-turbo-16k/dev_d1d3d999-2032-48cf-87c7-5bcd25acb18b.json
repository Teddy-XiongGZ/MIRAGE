    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, which is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs. To determine which drugs are not affected by ritonavir, we need to identify drugs that are not primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Let's go through the options:\\n\\nA. Amiodarone: Amiodarone is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, so it is likely to be affected by ritonavir.\\n\\nB. Phenytoin: Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes, not CYP3A4. Therefore, it is not likely to be affected by ritonavir.\\n\\nC. Cisapride: Cisapride is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, so it is likely to be affected by ritonavir.\\n\\nD. Midazolam: Midazolam is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, so it is likely to be affected by ritonavir.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the drug that is not likely to be affected by ritonavir is Phenytoin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
