    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The muscles of mastication are the muscles responsible for chewing and moving the jaw. These muscles include the temporalis, masseter, medial pterygoid, and lateral pterygoid muscles. The blood supply to these muscles is important for their function. The maxillary artery is the main artery that supplies blood to the muscles of mastication. It is a branch of the external carotid artery. The maxillary artery has three parts: the first part, the second part, and the third part. The first part of the maxillary artery gives off several branches, including the middle meningeal artery and the inferior alveolar artery. The middle meningeal artery supplies blood to the meninges of the brain, while the inferior alveolar artery supplies blood to the lower teeth and the muscles of mastication. Therefore, the muscles of mastication are supplied by the first part of the maxillary artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
