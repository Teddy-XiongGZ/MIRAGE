    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the information provided, the 10-year-old boy has a complicated crown fracture with abscess formation in tooth 12. The X-ray reveals radiolucency in relation to teeth 11 and 12. Tooth 12 has an immature blunderbuss canal, while tooth 11 has complete root formation. The vitality of teeth 11 and 21 is negative. Given the presence of abscess formation and the negative vitality of teeth 11 and 21, it indicates that there is infection and necrosis in tooth 12. Since tooth 12 has an immature blunderbuss canal, apexification can be considered as a treatment option. Apexification involves inducing a calcified barrier at the apex of the root to promote healing and prevent further infection. However, tooth 11 has complete root formation and negative vitality, indicating necrosis. Therefore, root canal treatment (RCT) is required for tooth 11 to remove the infection and preserve the tooth. Based on this analysis, the appropriate management for this patient would be Apexification of tooth 12 and RCT of tooth 11. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Apexification of 12 and RCT of 11.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
