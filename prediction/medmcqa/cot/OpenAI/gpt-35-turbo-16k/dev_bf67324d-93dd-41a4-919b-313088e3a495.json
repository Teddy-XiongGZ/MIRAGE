    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lidocaine is a local anesthetic commonly used in dentistry. To determine why it is used more commonly in dentistry, we need to evaluate the properties and characteristics of lidocaine compared to other local anesthetics. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Causes less depression of CNS: Lidocaine is known to have a lower risk of causing central nervous system (CNS) depression compared to other local anesthetics. This is because lidocaine has a shorter duration of action and is metabolized more rapidly.\\n\\nB. Causes less cardiovascular collapse: Lidocaine is also associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular collapse compared to other local anesthetics. It has less potential for causing significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure.\\n\\nC. Causes lesser incidence of allergic reactions: Lidocaine is generally well-tolerated and has a low incidence of allergic reactions. However, it is not specifically known to have a significantly lower incidence compared to other local anesthetics.\\n\\nD. Is 50 times more potent than procaine: Lidocaine is indeed more potent than procaine, but the question is asking about the reasons for its common use in dentistry, not its potency.\\n\\nConsidering the above analysis, the most appropriate answer is B. Causes less cardiovascular collapse.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
