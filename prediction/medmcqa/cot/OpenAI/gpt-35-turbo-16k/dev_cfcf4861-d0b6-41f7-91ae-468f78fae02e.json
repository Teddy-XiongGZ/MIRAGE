    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has a burn injury on both hands and palms. The lesion is pink, oozing, and painful to air and touch. Based on this information, it is likely a superficial partial-thickness burn. The management of burn injuries depends on the depth and extent of the burn. In this case, since the burn is superficial and involves a small area, conservative management with topical dressings is usually sufficient. Paraffin gauze and dressing is a commonly used dressing for superficial burns as it provides a moist environment for wound healing and helps to reduce pain. Collagen dressing is not typically used for superficial burns. Excision and grafting is usually reserved for deep burns or burns involving a large area. Applying 1% silver sulfasalazine ointment and keeping the wound open is not the best management for this patient as it does not provide adequate wound coverage and may increase the risk of infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
