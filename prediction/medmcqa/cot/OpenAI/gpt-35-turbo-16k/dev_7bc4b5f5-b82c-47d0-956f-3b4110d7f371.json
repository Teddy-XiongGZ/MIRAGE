    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Clubfoot, also known as congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), is a condition where a baby's foot is twisted out of shape or position. It is a congenital condition, meaning it is present at birth. There are several known causes of clubfoot in newborns. Ahogryposis multiplex congenita is a condition characterized by multiple joint contractures and is known to be associated with clubfoot. Polio, a viral infection that affects the nervous system, can also lead to clubfoot. Spina bifida, a birth defect where the spinal cord does not develop properly, can sometimes be associated with clubfoot as well. However, CTEV itself is not a cause of clubfoot, as it is the medical term used to describe the condition. Therefore, the correct answer is A. CTEV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
