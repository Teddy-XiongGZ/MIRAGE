    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine how much one unit of PRBC raises HCT (hematocrit), we need to consider the volume of PRBC and the volume of blood. One unit of PRBC typically contains about 200-250 mL of packed red blood cells. The total blood volume in an average adult is approximately 5 liters (5000 mL). Therefore, to calculate the percentage increase in HCT, we can divide the volume of PRBC by the total blood volume and multiply by 100. This will give us the percentage increase in HCT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. 3-5%\"}"
