    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cell junctions allowing exchange of cytoplasmic molecules between two cells are called gap junctions. Gap junctions are specialized intercellular connections formed by channels called connexons that allow small molecules and ions to pass directly from one cell to another. Tight junctions, on the other hand, are cell junctions that seal adjacent cells together, preventing the passage of molecules between them. Anchoring junctions are cell junctions that provide mechanical support and stability to tissues by anchoring cells to each other or to the extracellular matrix. Focal junctions are not a recognized type of cell junction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
