    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Model plaster (white) is largely composed of calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO4 \u2022 \u00bdH2O). This is because model plaster is a type of dental stone that is used to create study models in dentistry. Calcium sulfate hemihydrate is the main component of dental stone, which is a form of gypsum.
