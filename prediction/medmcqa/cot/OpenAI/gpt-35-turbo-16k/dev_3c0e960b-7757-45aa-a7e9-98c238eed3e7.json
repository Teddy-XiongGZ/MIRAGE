    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The zygomatic arch is a bony structure that forms the prominence of the cheek. It consists of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone. Zygomatic arch fractures are commonly caused by trauma to the face, such as a direct blow or a fall. To determine the most common site of zygomatic arch fracture, we need to consider the anatomy of the zygomatic arch. The zygomaticotemporal suture is the junction between the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone. Fractures can occur anterior or posterior to this suture, or even involve the suture itself. Based on this information, we can eliminate options C and D. To determine whether fractures are more common anterior or posterior to the zygomaticotemporal suture, further analysis or research is needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. No specific location\"}"
