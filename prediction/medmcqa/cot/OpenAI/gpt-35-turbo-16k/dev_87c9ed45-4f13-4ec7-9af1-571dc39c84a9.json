    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of non-utatiening macules and pappules on the skin, along with perivascular IgA deposition on skin biopsy, suggests a vasculitis. Among the given options, the most likely diagnosis is Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP). HSP is a systemic vasculitis that commonly affects children and is characterized by the deposition of IgA immune complexes in small blood vessels. It typically presents with a rash consisting of non-utatiening macules and pappules, often on the lower extremities. Other common features of HSP include joint pain, abdominal pain, and kidney involvement. Wegener's granulomatosis and drug-induced vasculitis are less likely in this case as they typically present with different clinical features. Kawasaki disease is also less likely as it typically presents with fever, conjunctivitis, mucositis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and changes in the lips and oral mucosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
