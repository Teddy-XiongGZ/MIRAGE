    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The endo-cochlear potential refers to the electrical potential difference between the endolymph and perilymph in the cochlea. The endolymph is found in the scala media, while the perilymph is found in the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. The endo-cochlear potential is positive, indicating that the endolymph is more positively charged compared to the perilymph. Therefore, the correct answer is A. +45 mV.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
