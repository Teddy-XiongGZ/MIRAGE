    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The inferior alveolar nerve block is a common dental anesthesia technique used to numb the lower teeth and jaw. In this technique, a local anesthetic (LA) is deposited near the inferior alveolar nerve to block its transmission of pain signals. The question asks where the LA is deposited in this technique. Step 1: The sigmoid notch is a depression on the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible. It is not the site where the LA is deposited in an inferior alveolar nerve block. Step 2: The coronoid notch is a small notch on the anterior border of the ramus of the mandible. It is not the site where the LA is deposited in an inferior alveolar nerve block. Step 3: The lingula is a bony projection on the medial aspect of the ramus of the mandible. It serves as a landmark for the deposition of the LA in an inferior alveolar nerve block. The LA is deposited just anterior to the lingula. Step 4: The groove of the mandibular neck is a groove on the medial aspect of the mandibular ramus. It is not the site where the LA is deposited in an inferior alveolar nerve block. Based on the above steps, the correct answer is C. Lingula.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
