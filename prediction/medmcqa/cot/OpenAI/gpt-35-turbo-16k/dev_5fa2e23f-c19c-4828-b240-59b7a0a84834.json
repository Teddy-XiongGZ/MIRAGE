    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ideal temperature in the delivery room for neonates to be kept in a warmer depends on maintaining their body temperature. Newborns are unable to regulate their body temperature effectively, so they rely on external sources of heat. The temperature in the delivery room should be warm enough to prevent hypothermia but not too hot to cause hyperthermia. The normal body temperature for a newborn is around 36.5-37.5 degrees Celsius. Considering this, the ideal temperature range in the delivery room for neonates to be kept in a warmer would be slightly higher than their normal body temperature. Therefore, the correct answer would be D. 37degC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
