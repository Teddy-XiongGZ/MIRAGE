    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antibiotics can target different components of bacterial cells to inhibit their growth and reproduction. In this case, we are looking for an antibiotic that interferes with DNA function. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that works by damaging the DNA of bacteria and other microorganisms. Nystatin is an antifungal medication that targets the cell membrane of fungi, not DNA. Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, not DNA function. Sulphonamides are a group of antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of folic acid, which is essential for DNA synthesis, but they do not directly interfere with DNA function. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Metronidazole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
