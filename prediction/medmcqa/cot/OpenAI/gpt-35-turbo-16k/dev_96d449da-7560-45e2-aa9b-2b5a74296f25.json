Are helper T cells: Helper T cells are a type of T cells that help coordinate the immune response. This could be a potential answer.\\n\\nB. Oligoclonal proliferation: Oligoclonal proliferation refers to the expansion of a limited number of clones of lymphocytes. This is not specific to ythT cells.\\n\\nC. Antigen presentation: Antigen presentation is the process by which cells display antigens to activate the immune response. This is a general function of T cells, including ythT cells.\\n\\nD. Opsonization: Opsonization is the process of marking pathogens for destruction by immune cells. This is not specific to ythT cells.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, it seems that the correct answer is A. Are helper T cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
