    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In excitable cells, repolarization refers to the restoration of the cell's membrane potential to its resting state after depolarization. During depolarization, the cell's membrane potential becomes more positive due to the influx of positive ions. To repolarize the cell, the membrane potential needs to return to its resting state, which is typically negative. This is achieved by the efflux of positive ions, specifically potassium ions (K+). Therefore, the correct answer is C. K+ efflux.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
