    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the number of people with systolic blood pressure more than 130, we need to calculate the area under the normal distribution curve to the right of 130. Since the distribution is normal, we can use the Z-score formula to calculate the area. The formula for Z-score is (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the value we want to find the area for, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. In this case, X = 130, \u03bc = 130, and \u03c3 is not given. However, since the distribution is normal, we know that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations, and 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. Therefore, we can estimate that the standard deviation is around 15. Using the Z-score formula, we can calculate the Z-score for X = 130 as (130 - 130) / 15 = 0. The area to the right of 130 is then 0.5 - 0.5 = 0.5. Therefore, the percentage of people with systolic blood pressure more than 130 is 50%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
