    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A stress breaker is a component used in dentistry to reduce stress on the abutment and alveolar ridge. It is typically used in cases where there is a significant difference in the height of the abutment and the alveolar ridge. The purpose of a stress breaker is to distribute the forces evenly between the abutment and the alveolar ridge, reducing the risk of damage or discomfort. However, in modern dentistry, the use of stress breakers is generally avoided because they can cause complications. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the potential effects of a stress breaker on the abutment and alveolar ridge.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
