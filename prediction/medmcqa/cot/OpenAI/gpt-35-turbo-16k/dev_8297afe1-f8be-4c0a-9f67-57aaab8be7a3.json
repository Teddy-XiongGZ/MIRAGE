    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) after carotid management. The blood pressure is low at 70/30 mm/Hg, indicating hemodynamic instability. Vagal maneuver, which is a non-invasive method to slow down the heart rate, has failed. Adenosine, which is a first-line medication for PSVT, has also been given but did not work. Given the patient's hemodynamic instability and refractoriness to adenosine, the next step should be to consider synchronized cardioversion. Synchronized cardioversion is a procedure where an electrical shock is delivered to the heart at a specific time during the cardiac cycle to restore normal sinus rhythm. This is the most appropriate choice in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Synchronised Cardioversion\"}"
