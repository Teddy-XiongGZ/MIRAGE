    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In cases of dehydration secondary to diarrhea, the primary goal is to replace the lost fluids and electrolytes. The most appropriate intravenous agent for this purpose is a solution that contains electrolytes. Options A and B, which are 10% glucose solution and distilled water, do not contain electrolytes and are not suitable for rehydration. Option D, which is 5% glucose solution, does contain some electrolytes but is primarily used for providing energy rather than rehydration.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 0.9% saline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
