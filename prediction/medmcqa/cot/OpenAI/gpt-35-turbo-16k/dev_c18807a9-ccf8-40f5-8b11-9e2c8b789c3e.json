    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the accurate representation of the woman's obstetric history, we need to understand the meaning of the terms 'gravid' (G) and 'para' (P). Gravid (G) refers to the total number of pregnancies, including the current one. Para (P) refers to the number of pregnancies that have reached the stage of viability (20 weeks or more), regardless of the outcome (live birth or stillbirth). Based on the information provided, the woman has a twin pregnancy (current pregnancy) and has had 2 first trimester abortions. This means she has been pregnant 3 times in total, including the current pregnancy. However, none of her previous pregnancies have reached the stage of viability (20 weeks or more), as they ended in first trimester abortions. Therefore, her accurate representation would be G4P1 0+1+2, which means she has been pregnant 4 times (including the current pregnancy), has 1 pregnancy that has reached the stage of viability (her 3-year-old child), and has had 2 first trimester abortions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. G4P1 0+1+2\"}"
