    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Intrusive luxation is a type of dental injury where the tooth is pushed into the socket. The fixation period refers to the duration for which the tooth needs to be stabilized in its correct position to allow for healing. The goal is to allow the periodontal ligament to heal and reattach the tooth to the surrounding bone. Typically, the fixation period for intrusive luxation injury is longer compared to other types of dental injuries. This is because the tooth has been pushed into the socket and needs more time to heal and reestablish its position. Option A, 2 weeks, seems too short for the fixation period of an intrusive luxation injury. Option B, 4 weeks, is a possibility as it allows for a longer healing period compared to option A. Option C, 4 weeks if semi-rigid and 2 weeks if rigid, suggests that the fixation period may vary depending on the type of splint used. This could be a plausible answer as different types of splints may have different recommendations for the duration of stabilization. Option D, 6-8 weeks, seems like a longer fixation period compared to the other options. Considering the options, it is reasonable to choose option C, 4 weeks if semi-rigid and 2 weeks if rigid, as it takes into account the potential variation in fixation period based on the type of splint used.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
