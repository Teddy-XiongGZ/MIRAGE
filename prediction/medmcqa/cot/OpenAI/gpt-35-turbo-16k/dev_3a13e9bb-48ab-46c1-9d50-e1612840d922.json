    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Immediately after normal delivery, the most likely cause of shock in a patient can be determined by considering the potential complications that can occur during childbirth. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Amniotic fluid embolism: This is a rare but serious condition where amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation, leading to respiratory distress, cardiovascular collapse, and shock. While it can cause shock, it is not the most common cause immediately after normal delivery.\\n\\nB. PPH (Postpartum hemorrhage): This is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. It occurs due to excessive bleeding after delivery, leading to hypovolemic shock. PPH is a more common cause of shock immediately after normal delivery compared to amniotic fluid embolism.\\n\\nC. Uterine inversion: Uterine inversion is a rare but life-threatening complication where the uterus turns inside out after delivery. It can cause shock due to severe bleeding. However, it is not as common as PPH.\\n\\nD. Eclampsia: Eclampsia is a condition characterized by seizures in a pregnant woman with high blood pressure. While it can cause complications such as cerebral hemorrhage, it is not the most likely cause of shock immediately after normal delivery. \\n\\nConsidering the options, the most likely cause of shock immediately after normal delivery is PPH (Postpartum hemorrhage).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
