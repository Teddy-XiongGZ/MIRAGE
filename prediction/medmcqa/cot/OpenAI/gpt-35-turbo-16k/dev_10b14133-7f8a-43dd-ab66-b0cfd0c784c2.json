    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. It primarily affects the central nervous system. The different stages of neurocysticercosis include vesicular, vesicular colloidal, granular nodular, and nodular calcified. In the vesicular stage, the cysts are small and contain clear fluid. In the vesicular colloidal stage, the cysts become larger and show signs of degeneration. In the granular nodular stage, the cysts become more solid and show signs of inflammation. In the nodular calcified stage, the cysts become calcified and are no longer active. Edema refers to the swelling caused by inflammation. Based on this information, the stage of neurocysticercosis in which there is no edema is the nodular calcified stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
