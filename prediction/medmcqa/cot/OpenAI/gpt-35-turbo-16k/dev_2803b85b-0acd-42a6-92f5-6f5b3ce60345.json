    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dunlop's beta hypothesis is a concept in dentistry that suggests that the tongue posture can affect the development and treatment of certain oral habits. Bruxism, thumb sucking, mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting are all examples of oral habits. To determine which habit Dunlop's beta hypothesis is useful for, we need to consider the relationship between tongue posture and each habit. Bruxism is the habit of grinding or clenching the teeth, thumb sucking is the habit of sucking the thumb, mouth breathing is the habit of breathing through the mouth instead of the nose, and tongue thrusting is the habit of pushing the tongue against the front teeth during swallowing or at rest. Based on Dunlop's beta hypothesis, the tongue posture is likely to have an impact on tongue thrusting, as it involves the positioning of the tongue against the front teeth. Therefore, the answer is D. Tongue thrusting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
