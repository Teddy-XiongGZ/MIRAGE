    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and their specific sequence determines the structure and function of the protein. Therefore, replacing an amino acid can potentially change its function. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Glutamine to Asparagine: Both glutamine and asparagine are polar amino acids with similar properties. Replacing glutamine with asparagine is a conservative substitution and is unlikely to significantly change the function of the protein. \\n\\nB. Aspartate and Glutamate: Aspartate and glutamate are both negatively charged amino acids. Replacing one with the other is also a conservative substitution and is unlikely to change the function of the protein. \\n\\nC. Alanine to Tryptophan: Alanine is a nonpolar amino acid, while tryptophan is a bulky aromatic amino acid. This substitution can significantly alter the structure and function of the protein. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. None of these, as both options A and B involve conservative substitutions that are unlikely to change the function of the protein, while option C involves a substitution that can change the function of the protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
