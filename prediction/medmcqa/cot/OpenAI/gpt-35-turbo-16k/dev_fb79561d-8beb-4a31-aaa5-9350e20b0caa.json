    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The correct sequence of steps for intubation is as follows: 1. Head extension and flexion of neck (a) - This helps to align the airway and make it easier to visualize the vocal cords. 2. Introduction of laryngoscope (b) - The laryngoscope is used to lift the tongue and epiglottis, allowing visualization of the vocal cords. 3. Inflation of cuff (c) - Once the endotracheal tube is in place, the cuff is inflated to create a seal and prevent air leakage. 4. Check breath sounds with stethoscope (d) - This is done to confirm correct placement of the endotracheal tube in the trachea. 5. Fixation of the tube to prevent dislodgement (e) - The endotracheal tube is secured in place to prevent accidental removal or movement. Based on these steps, the correct sequence is DBCEA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
