    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"GIC stands for Glass Ionomer Cement. Glass ionomer cements are commonly used in dentistry for restorative and adhesive purposes. The bond found in GIC is a specific type of bond that forms between the glass particles and the polyacid. This bond is known as an ionic bond because it involves the transfer of electrons between the glass particles and the polyacid. Ionic bonds are formed between atoms with a significant difference in electronegativity, resulting in the transfer of electrons from one atom to another. Therefore, the answer is B. Ionic bond.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
