    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the management of anaphylaxis, adrenaline is used as a first-line treatment. Adrenaline acts on various receptors in the body to counteract the severe allergic reaction. Let's go through each option to determine which action of adrenaline is not observed in the management of anaphylaxis. A. Bronchodilation by beta-receptors: Adrenaline acts on beta-receptors in the lungs to cause bronchodilation, which helps to relieve airway constriction in anaphylaxis. This action is observed in the management of anaphylaxis. B. Cardiovascular effects of beta-receptors: Adrenaline also acts on beta-receptors in the heart to increase heart rate and contractility, which helps to maintain blood pressure during anaphylaxis. This action is observed in the management of anaphylaxis. C. Action on blood vessels by alpha-receptors: Adrenaline acts on alpha-receptors in the blood vessels to cause vasoconstriction, which helps to increase blood pressure during anaphylaxis. This action is observed in the management of anaphylaxis. D. Action on presynaptic alpha-receptors: Adrenaline can also act on presynaptic alpha-receptors to inhibit the release of further allergic mediators. This action is observed in the management of anaphylaxis. Based on this analysis, the action of adrenaline that is not observed in the management of anaphylaxis is D. Action on presynaptic alpha-receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
