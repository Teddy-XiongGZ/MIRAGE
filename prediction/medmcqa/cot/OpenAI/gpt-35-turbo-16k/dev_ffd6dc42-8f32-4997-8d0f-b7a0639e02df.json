    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Osteoblasts are bone-forming cells that play a crucial role in bone development and remodeling. Let's evaluate each statement to determine which one is false. \\n\\nA. Derived from osteoprogenitor cells: This statement is true. Osteoblasts are derived from osteoprogenitor cells, which are mesenchymal stem cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts. \\n\\nB. Regulated by BM P: This statement is true. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are known to regulate the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts. \\n\\nC. Have a plasma membrane showing multiple folds: This statement is true. Osteoblasts have a plasma membrane with multiple folds, known as ruffled borders, which increase their surface area for mineral deposition. \\n\\nD. Have neuropeptide receptors: This statement is false. Osteoblasts do not have neuropeptide receptors. Neuropeptide receptors are typically found on neurons and other cell types involved in neuronal signaling. \\n\\nTherefore, the false statement about osteoblasts is D. Have neuropeptide receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
