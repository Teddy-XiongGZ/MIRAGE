    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Galactorrhea-amenorrhea syndromes are characterized by the presence of galactorrhea (abnormal milk production) and amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods). One of the common causes of this syndrome is hyperprolactinemia, which is an elevated level of prolactin hormone in the blood. Therefore, the investigation that should be advised in Galactorrhea-amenorrhea syndromes, apart from serum prolactin, is to check the levels of other hormones that may be involved in regulating the menstrual cycle. The options provided are TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), and urinary ketosteroids. TSH is a hormone that regulates the thyroid gland and is not directly related to the menstrual cycle. LH is a hormone that plays a crucial role in ovulation and the menstrual cycle, so it is a relevant investigation in this scenario. hCG is a hormone that is produced during pregnancy and is not directly related to the menstrual cycle. Urinary ketosteroids are not directly related to the menstrual cycle either. Therefore, the correct investigation to advise in Galactorrhea-amenorrhea syndromes, apart from serum prolactin, is LH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
