    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital CMV infection refers to the transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy. CMV is a common virus that can cause serious complications in newborns. When considering the potential abnormalities seen in a fetus with congenital CMV infection, it is important to understand the effects of the virus on different organ systems. A. Colitis: Colitis refers to inflammation of the colon. While CMV can cause gastrointestinal symptoms in infected individuals, colitis is not a commonly seen abnormality in a fetus with congenital CMV infection. B. Myocarditis: Myocarditis refers to inflammation of the heart muscle. CMV can affect the heart and cause myocarditis in infected individuals. However, myocarditis is not a commonly seen abnormality in a fetus with congenital CMV infection. C. Blood dyscrasias: Blood dyscrasias refer to abnormalities in the blood, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia. CMV can affect the blood cells and cause blood dyscrasias in infected individuals. Therefore, blood dyscrasias are commonly seen in a fetus with congenital CMV infection. D. Pulmonary cyst: A pulmonary cyst is a fluid-filled sac in the lung. While CMV can affect the lungs and cause respiratory symptoms in infected individuals, pulmonary cysts are not a commonly seen abnormality in a fetus with congenital CMV infection. Based on the above information, the correct answer is C. Blood dyscrasias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
