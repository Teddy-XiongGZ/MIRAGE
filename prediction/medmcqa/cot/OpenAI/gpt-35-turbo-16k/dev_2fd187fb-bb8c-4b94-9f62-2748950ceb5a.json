    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thiopental is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic. To determine which factor contributes to its short duration of action, we need to consider its pharmacokinetics. A. Rapid biotransformation: Thiopental is metabolized in the liver, but the rate of biotransformation alone does not necessarily determine the duration of action. B. Rapid accumulation in body fat: Thiopental is a highly lipid-soluble drug, but rapid accumulation in body fat would actually prolong its duration of action, not shorten it. C. High lipid solubility: Thiopental's high lipid solubility allows it to rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain, leading to a rapid onset of action. However, this factor does not contribute to its short duration of action. D. Ability to enter and leave brain tissue rapidly: This is the correct answer. Thiopental's ability to rapidly enter and leave brain tissue contributes to its short duration of action. Once it enters the brain, it is quickly redistributed to other tissues, resulting in a rapid termination of its effects. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Ability to enter and leave brain tissue rapidly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
