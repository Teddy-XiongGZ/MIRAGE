    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The condensation pressure required in dental amalgam restorations depends on the type of alloy used. Spherical amalgam alloys have a higher copper content compared to admixed amalgam alloys. Higher copper content in the alloy increases the strength and hardness of the amalgam. Lathe cut alloy is a type of amalgam alloy that has a different particle shape compared to spherical and admixed alloys. Now, considering the options given, the least condensation pressure is required in admixed amalgam alloy with low copper content. Therefore, the answer is C. Admixed amalgam alloy, low copper.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
