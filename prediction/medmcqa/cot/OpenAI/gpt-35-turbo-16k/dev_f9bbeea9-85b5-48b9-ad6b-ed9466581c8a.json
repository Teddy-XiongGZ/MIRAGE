    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Superelastic NiTi wires have the ability to undergo large deformations and then return to their original shape when the stress is removed. On the other hand, non-superelastic NiTi wires do not have this ability and will not return to their original shape after deformation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the spring back in bending is much greater for superelastic NiTi wires than non-superelastic NiTi wires.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
