    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An overindulgent mother tends to excessively pamper and spoil her child, often giving in to their every demand and not setting appropriate boundaries. This can lead to certain behavioral patterns in the child. A. Shy, submissive: This may not be a direct result of overindulgence. Shyness and submissiveness can be influenced by various factors, such as temperament and social experiences, and may not necessarily be caused by overindulgence. B. Aggressive, display temper tantrums: This is a possible outcome of overindulgence. When a child is constantly given what they want without having to work for it or face consequences for their actions, they may develop a sense of entitlement and become more prone to aggressive behavior and temper tantrums. C. Evasive and dawdling: This may not be directly related to overindulgence. Evasive behavior and dawdling can be influenced by various factors, such as personality traits and environmental factors, and may not necessarily be caused by overindulgence. D. Disobedient: This is a possible outcome of overindulgence. When a child is not taught appropriate boundaries and is constantly given what they want, they may become disobedient and have difficulty following rules and instructions. Based on the above analysis, the most likely answer is B. Aggressive, display temper tantrums.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
