    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the body surface area involved in burns, we can use the rule of nines. According to the rule of nines, the body is divided into regions that represent 9% or multiples of 9% of the total body surface area. In a 2-year-old child, each upper limb represents 9% of the body surface area, the front of the chest and abdomen represents 18%, and the face represents 9%. Therefore, the total body surface area involved in this case would be 2 * 9% + 18% + 9% = 45%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
