    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maxillary first molar typically has three roots: distobuccal, mesiobuccal, and palatal. To determine the shortest root, we need to consider the anatomy of the tooth. The distobuccal root is located on the distal (back) side of the tooth, the mesiobuccal root is located on the mesial (front) side of the tooth, and the palatal root is located on the palatal (lingual) side of the tooth. Based on the anatomy, the shortest root of the maxillary first molar is the palatal root, as it is located on the lingual side of the tooth and is typically shorter than the other two roots.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Palatal\"}"
