    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The loading dose of MgSo4 for prophylaxis in pre-eclampsia is typically administered intravenously. The standard loading dose is 4-6 grams of MgSo4. To calculate the volume of MgSo4 solution needed, we need to know the concentration of the MgSo4 solution. Let's assume the concentration is 50% (which is a common concentration for MgSo4 solution). So, 4-6 grams of MgSo4 would be equivalent to 8-12 grams of the 50% MgSo4 solution. To convert grams to milliliters, we need to know the density of the solution. Assuming the density is 1 g/mL, the volume of the 50% MgSo4 solution needed would be 8-12 mL. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 8ml MgSo4+10ml of NS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
