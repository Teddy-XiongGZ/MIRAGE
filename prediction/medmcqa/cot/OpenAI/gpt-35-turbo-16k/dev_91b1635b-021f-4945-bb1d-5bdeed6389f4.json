    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a left skewed curve, the tail of the curve is longer on the left side and the majority of the data is concentrated on the right side. This means that the values on the left side of the curve are smaller and the values on the right side are larger. A. Mean = Median: In a left skewed curve, the mean will be less than the median because the smaller values on the left side of the curve will pull the mean towards the left. B. Mean < Mode: This statement is true. In a left skewed curve, the mode will be greater than the mean because the mode represents the most frequently occurring value, which is likely to be on the right side of the curve where the majority of the data is concentrated. C. Mean > Mode: This statement is false. In a left skewed curve, the mean will be less than the mode. D. Mean = Mode: This statement is false. In a left skewed curve, the mean will not be equal to the mode.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Mean < Mode\"}"
