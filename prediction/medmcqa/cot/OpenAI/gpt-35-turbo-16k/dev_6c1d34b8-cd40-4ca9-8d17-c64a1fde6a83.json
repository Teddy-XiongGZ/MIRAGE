    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, which is the inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves. It is characterized by the formation of vegetations, which are bulky masses composed of platelets, fibrin, microorganisms, and inflammatory cells. These vegetations can form on the cusps of the heart valves. Additionally, infective endocarditis can lead to complications such as myocardial abscess, which is a localized collection of pus within the myocardium. Thrombus formation in the left atria can also occur in infective endocarditis due to the turbulent blood flow caused by the vegetations. Perforation of the cusps can also occur as a result of the infection. Therefore, all of the given options (A, B, C, and D) are features of infective endocarditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
