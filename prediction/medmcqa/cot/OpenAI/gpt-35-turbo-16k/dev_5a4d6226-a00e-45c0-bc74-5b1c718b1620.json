    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Baroreceptor is a type of sensory receptor that detects changes in blood pressure. It is primarily involved in regulating blood pressure. Baroreceptor feedback works to maintain homeostasis by detecting changes in blood pressure and initiating appropriate responses to bring it back to the set point. Since the baroreceptor feedback system works to counteract changes in blood pressure and maintain stability, it is an example of negative feedback. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Negative feedback.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
