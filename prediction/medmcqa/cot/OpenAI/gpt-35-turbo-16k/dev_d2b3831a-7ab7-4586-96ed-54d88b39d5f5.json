    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chlortetracycline is a type of tetracycline antibiotic. Tetracyclines primarily work by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. They do this by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of the bacterial ribosome, preventing the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. This ultimately leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis in bacteria. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Inhibition of protein synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
