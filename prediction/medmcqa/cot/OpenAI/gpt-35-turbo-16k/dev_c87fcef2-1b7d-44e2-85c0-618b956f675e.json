    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"DIC stands for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, which is a condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting and bleeding. In DIC, there is widespread activation of the coagulation system, leading to the consumption of clotting factors and platelets. This results in a decrease in fibrinogen levels (A) and thrombocytopenia (B). Additionally, DIC is associated with abnormal clotting times. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is usually prolonged in DIC due to the consumption of clotting factors, so a normal APTT (C) would not be expected. On the other hand, the prothrombin time (PT) is often elevated in DIC due to the consumption of clotting factors, so PT elevation (D) would be expected. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Normal APTT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
