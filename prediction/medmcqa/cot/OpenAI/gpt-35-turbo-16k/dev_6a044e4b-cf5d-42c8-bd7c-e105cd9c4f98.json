    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During tooth formation, there are several stages that occur. The first stage is the morpho differentiation stage, where the basic shape and structure of the tooth are determined. Next is the histodifferentiation stage, where the different types of dental tissues (enamel, dentin, pulp, etc.) are formed. After histodifferentiation, the tooth undergoes apposition, which is the stage where the size of the tooth is determined. Finally, calcification occurs, where the dental tissues harden and mineralize. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Apposition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
