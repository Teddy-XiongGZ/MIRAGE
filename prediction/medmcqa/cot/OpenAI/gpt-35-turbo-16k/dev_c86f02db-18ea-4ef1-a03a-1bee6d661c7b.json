    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Uniparental disomy (UPD) occurs when an individual inherits two copies of a chromosome, or part of a chromosome, from one parent and none from the other parent. This can lead to various syndromes. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are both examples of syndromes caused by uniparental disomy. Russell-Silver syndrome is also caused by uniparental disomy, specifically UPD of chromosome 7. Bloom syndrome, on the other hand, is not caused by uniparental disomy. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the BLM gene. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Bloom syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
