    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fluoride flux is commonly used in soldering process to remove oxides from the metal surfaces being soldered. It acts as a reducing agent and prevents the formation of metal oxides, such as copper oxide or chromium oxide. This is important because oxides can interfere with the soldering process by preventing proper wetting and bonding of the solder to the metal surfaces. Therefore, the correct answer is A. It prevents the formation of copper oxide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
