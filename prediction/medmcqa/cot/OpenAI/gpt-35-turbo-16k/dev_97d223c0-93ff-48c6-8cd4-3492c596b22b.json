    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate pulmonary compliance, we need to use the formula: Compliance = Change in volume / Change in pressure. The change in volume is the tidal volume, which is 500 mL. The change in pressure is the difference between the intrapleural pressure before and after inspiration, which is -4 cm of water - (-9 cm of water) = 5 cm of water. Therefore, the pulmonary compliance is 500 mL / 5 cm of water = 100 mL/cm of water. Converting mL to L, the pulmonary compliance is 0.1 L/cm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
