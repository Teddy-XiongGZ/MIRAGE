    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To prevent cross infection with the bite block of an orthopantamograph machine, several measures can be taken. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Cover with autoclaved cloth with each use: While covering the bite block with autoclaved cloth may provide some level of protection, it may not be sufficient to prevent cross infection as the cloth may not completely eliminate the risk of contamination.\\n\\nB. Using disposable bite blocks: This option is a more effective measure to prevent cross infection. Disposable bite blocks can be discarded after each use, ensuring that there is no risk of contamination.\\n\\nC. Clean with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite in each patient: While cleaning the bite block with sodium hypochlorite can help disinfect it, it may not completely eliminate the risk of cross infection. Additionally, the effectiveness of the disinfection process may depend on the thoroughness of the cleaning.\\n\\nD. Cover with impervious barrier: This option provides a physical barrier between the bite block and the patient, reducing the risk of cross infection. It is a commonly used measure in healthcare settings.\\n\\nConsidering the options, the most effective measure to prevent cross infection with the bite block of an orthopantamograph machine is using disposable bite blocks (Option B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
