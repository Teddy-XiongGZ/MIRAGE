    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Right trochlear nerve palsy affects the fourth cranial nerve, which innervates the superior oblique muscle. This muscle is responsible for downward and inward movement of the eye. Therefore, when the right trochlear nerve is affected, the patient will have difficulty moving the right eye downward and inward. This will result in diplopia (double vision) on upward gaze and adduction. Right head tilt is a compensatory mechanism seen in patients with right trochlear nerve palsy, as tilting the head to the right helps align the eyes and reduce diplopia. Exotropia, which is the outward deviation of the eye, can also be seen in right trochlear nerve palsy due to the unopposed action of the lateral rectus muscle. However, hyperopia (farsightedness) is not directly related to right trochlear nerve palsy. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Hyperopia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
