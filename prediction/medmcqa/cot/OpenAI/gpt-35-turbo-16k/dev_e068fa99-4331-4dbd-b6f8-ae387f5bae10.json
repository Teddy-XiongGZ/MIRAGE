    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tetanus is caused by the bacteria Clostridium tetani, which produces a toxin that affects the nervous system. To prevent tetanus, it is important to stimulate the body's immune response against the bacteria and its toxin. Surgical debridement and toilet, hyperbaric oxygen, and antibiotics are not the most effective ways of preventing tetanus. Surgical debridement and toilet are procedures used to clean and remove dead tissue from wounds, but they do not directly prevent tetanus. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat certain conditions, but it is not the most effective method for preventing tetanus. Antibiotics may be used to treat tetanus infection, but they are not the most effective way of preventing tetanus. The most effective way of preventing tetanus is through vaccination with tetanus toxoid, which stimulates the production of protective antibodies against the toxin produced by Clostridium tetani.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D.
