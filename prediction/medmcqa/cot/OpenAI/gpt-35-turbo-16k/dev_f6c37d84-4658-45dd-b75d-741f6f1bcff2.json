    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi tendon organ is a sensory receptor located in the tendons of skeletal muscles. It is responsible for monitoring the tension or force produced by the muscle. When the muscle contracts, the tension in the muscle increases. The Golgi tendon organ detects this increase in tension and relays this information to the efferent neurons. Based on this information, we can conclude that the Golgi tendon organ continuously relays information about the tension in the muscle during voluntary movements.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
