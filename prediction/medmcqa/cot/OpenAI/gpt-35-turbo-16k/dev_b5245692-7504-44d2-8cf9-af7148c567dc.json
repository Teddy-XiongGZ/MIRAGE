    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ligamentum flavum is a ligament located in the spine. It connects the laminae of adjacent vertebrae. To determine the composition of the ligamentum flavum, we need to consider the types of fibers found in ligaments. Ligaments are primarily composed of collagen fibers, which provide strength and stability. There are two main types of collagen fibers: Type-I collagen and Type-II collagen. Reticular fibers are a type of collagen fiber that forms a network-like structure. Elastic fibers, as the name suggests, are responsible for the elasticity of tissues. Now, let's consider the options. Option A states Type-I collagen, which is a common type of collagen found in ligaments. Option B states Type-II collagen, which is primarily found in cartilage. Option C states reticular fibers, which are not the main component of ligaments. Option D states elastic fibers, which are present in ligaments but not the primary component. Based on this information, the most appropriate answer is A. Type-I collagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
