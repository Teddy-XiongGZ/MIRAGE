    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Looseness of dentures within two to four hours of insertion suggests a mechanical issue rather than a psychological or adaptive unresponsiveness. Deflective occlusion refers to an improper alignment of the teeth, which can cause discomfort and difficulty in chewing but is less likely to cause immediate looseness of dentures. Unretentive denture, on the other hand, refers to a denture that does not fit properly or lacks proper retention. This can lead to the denture becoming loose shortly after insertion. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's complaint is an unretentive denture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
