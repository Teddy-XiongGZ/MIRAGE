    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the symptoms described, the patient is presenting with an infectious process associated with the maxillary right lateral incisor. The presence of a deeply carious and non-restorable tooth suggests that the infection has likely spread to the surrounding tissues. The patient's elevated temperature of 102\u00b0F indicates systemic involvement. The swelling on the right side of the face, inability to open the right eye, and the soft, painful, and rebounding tissue on palpation suggest the presence of an abscess. Given these findings, the most appropriate treatment for the patient would be incision and drainage (C). This procedure involves making an incision to allow for the release of pus and fluid from the abscess, followed by thorough irrigation and possibly placement of a drain. This will help alleviate the symptoms, promote healing, and prevent further spread of the infection. Antibiotics alone (B) may not be sufficient to address the localized abscess, and aspiration (A) would not adequately address the underlying infection. Antibiotics, heat, and fluid (D) may be used as adjunctive measures, but the primary treatment for an abscess would still be incision and drainage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
