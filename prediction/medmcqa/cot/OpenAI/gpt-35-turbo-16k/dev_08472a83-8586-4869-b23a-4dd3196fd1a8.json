    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Symphyseal fracture refers to a fracture of the pubic symphysis, which is the joint between the two pubic bones in the pelvis. Lag screw fixation is a surgical technique used to stabilize the fracture by inserting a screw across the fracture line. A. Load bearing refers to a type of fixation where the implant bears the majority of the load. In symphyseal fracture with lag screw fixation, the screw is not designed to bear the entire load, so this option is unlikely. B. Load sharing refers to a type of fixation where the implant shares the load with the bone. In symphyseal fracture with lag screw fixation, the screw is intended to share the load with the bone, providing stability and allowing for healing. This option is a possible choice. C. Adaptation osteosynthesis refers to a technique where the fracture fragments are aligned and held in place with screws or plates. While lag screw fixation does involve aligning the fracture fragments, it is not specifically referred to as adaptation osteosynthesis. This option is less likely. D. Compression osteosynthesis refers to a technique where the fracture fragments are compressed together using screws or other implants. In symphyseal fracture with lag screw fixation, the screw is typically used to stabilize the fracture rather than provide compression. This option is less likely. Based on the above reasoning, the most appropriate answer choice is B. Load sharing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
