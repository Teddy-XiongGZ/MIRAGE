    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fracture line extending 4 mm gingival below CEJ indicates that the fracture involves the root of the tooth. The thin bone buccally and thick apicopalatally suggests that the tooth is more stable on the palatal side. Considering these factors, the treatment of choice would be to preserve the tooth and provide a long-term solution. The socket shield technique involves retaining the buccal portion of the root and placing an implant in the palatal area. However, this technique is more suitable for intact teeth with a healthy periodontium. Post and core is a restorative option but may not provide sufficient stability for a fractured tooth. Extraction and implant is a viable option but should be considered as a last resort. Socket preservation is a technique used to maintain the dimensions of the extraction socket for future implant placement. Given the information provided, the most appropriate treatment of choice would be extraction and implant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Extraction and implant\"}"
