    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The maximum strain of the parturient heart refers to the period of highest stress on the heart during pregnancy. To determine when this occurs, we need to consider the changes that happen to the heart during pregnancy. During pregnancy, there is an increase in blood volume and cardiac output to meet the demands of the growing fetus. This increase in workload on the heart is highest during the third trimester when the fetus is at its largest and the demands for oxygen and nutrients are highest. Therefore, the maximum strain of the parturient heart occurs at term, which is the end of the third trimester.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
