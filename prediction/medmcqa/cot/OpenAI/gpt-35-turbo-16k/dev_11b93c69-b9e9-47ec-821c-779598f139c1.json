    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Paravertebral block is a regional anesthesia technique where local anesthetic is injected near the spinal nerves as they exit the spinal column. The drug diffuses to block the nerves and provide pain relief. The drug injected for paravertebral block is least likely to diffuse to the subarachnoid space (option B) because the drug is not injected into the spinal canal. The drug is also unlikely to diffuse to the epidural space (option A) because the injection is not made into the epidural space. The drug is most likely to diffuse to the intercostal space (option C) and the superior and inferior paravertebral space (option D) as these are the intended areas for the block.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
