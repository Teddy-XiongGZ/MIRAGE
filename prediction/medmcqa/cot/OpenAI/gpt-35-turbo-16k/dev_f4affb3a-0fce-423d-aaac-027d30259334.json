    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A-alpha fibers are a type of nerve fibers that are responsible for transmitting sensory information related to touch and proprioception. These fibers are large and myelinated, which allows for fast conduction of nerve impulses. The speed of conduction of A-alpha fibers is typically in the range of 70-120 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 70-120.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
