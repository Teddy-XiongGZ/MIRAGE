    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Internal occlusal rest is an important component of a partial denture that helps to provide stability and support. Let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not provided by the internal occlusal rest. \\n\\nA. Horizontal stabilization: The internal occlusal rest helps to stabilize the partial denture horizontally by preventing lateral movement of the denture. \\n\\nB. Retention: The internal occlusal rest helps to retain the partial denture in place by preventing vertical movement of the denture. \\n\\nC. Vertical stop: The internal occlusal rest acts as a vertical stop, preventing the partial denture from over-seating and damaging the underlying tissues. \\n\\nD. Occlusal support: The internal occlusal rest provides support to the occlusal surface of the partial denture, helping to distribute forces evenly during chewing. \\n\\nBased on this evaluation, it can be concluded that the internal occlusal rest provides all of the mentioned options. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
