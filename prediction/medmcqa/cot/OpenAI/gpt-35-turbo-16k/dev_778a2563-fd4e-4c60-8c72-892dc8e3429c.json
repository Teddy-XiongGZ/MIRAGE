    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The first step in the management of an apneic child is to ensure adequate ventilation. In this case, the child is already being ventilated with a bag and a mask. The next step would be to check the child's oxygen saturation to assess the effectiveness of ventilation and oxygenation. Checking pulses and starting chest compressions would be appropriate if the child does not have a pulse or if the pulse is absent or weak. Intubation may be necessary if the child's airway cannot be adequately maintained with bag and mask ventilation, but this would not be the next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Check oxygen saturation\"}"
