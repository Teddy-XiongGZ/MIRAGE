    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition where a left-to-right shunt, such as a ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), causes increased blood flow to the lungs. Over time, this increased blood flow can lead to pulmonary hypertension and reversal of the shunt, resulting in right-to-left shunting. Signs of impending Eisenmenger syndrome include increased flow murmur across the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, loud P2 (pulmonary component of the second heart sound), and a Graham steel murmur (continuous murmur heard over the pulmonary area). A single S2 is not typically associated with Eisenmenger syndrome. Therefore, the answer choice that does not fit the signs of impending Eisenmenger syndrome is B. Single S2.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
