    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During pregnancy, there are several cardiovascular changes that occur to support the growing fetus. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Increased stroke volume: During pregnancy, the stroke volume increases due to an increase in blood volume and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This is a normal adaptation.\\n\\nB. Increased cardiac output: The cardiac output increases during pregnancy to meet the increased metabolic demands. This is a normal adaptation.\\n\\nC. Increased intravascular volume: During pregnancy, there is an increase in blood volume to support the needs of the developing fetus. This is a normal adaptation.\\n\\nD. Increased peripheral resistance: This option is incorrect. During pregnancy, there is a decrease in peripheral resistance due to hormonal and vascular changes. This helps to maintain an adequate blood supply to the placenta and fetus.\\n\\nBased on the above explanations, the correct answer is D. Increased peripheral resistance is not seen in pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
