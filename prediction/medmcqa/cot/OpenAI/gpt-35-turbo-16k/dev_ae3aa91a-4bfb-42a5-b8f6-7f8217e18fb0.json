    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the number of infants that should be registered with a health worker at the sub center, we need to consider the capacity and workload of the health worker. The number of infants that can be effectively managed by a health worker depends on various factors such as the availability of resources, the time required for each infant's care, and the workload of the health worker. It is difficult to determine the exact number without more information about the specific sub center and the health worker's capacity. However, in general, a health worker at a sub center may be able to effectively manage a smaller number of infants compared to a larger health facility. Considering this, it is unlikely that a sub center would have a capacity to register a large number of infants. Therefore, the most reasonable choice would be A. 50 infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
