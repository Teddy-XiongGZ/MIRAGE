    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which Glomerulonephritis has Nephrotic syndrome, we need to understand the characteristics of each option. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) is a cause of Nephrotic syndrome. Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis typically presents with hematuria and mild proteinuria, not Nephrotic syndrome. MPGN (Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis) can present with both Nephrotic and Nephritic syndrome, but it is not exclusively associated with Nephrotic syndrome. Minimal Change Disease is a common cause of Nephrotic syndrome in children. Based on this information, the correct answer is D. Minimal Change Disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
