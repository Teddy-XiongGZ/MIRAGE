    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most effective method of assessing breathing is by measuring the respiratory rate. Tidal volume refers to the amount of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath, which is important but does not provide a comprehensive assessment of breathing. Alveolar ventilation is the amount of fresh air reaching the alveoli per minute, which is also important but requires more complex measurements. FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) is a measure of lung function and not specifically a method of assessing breathing. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Respiratory rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
