    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The next investigation to consider in a female with a history of two second trimester abortions is to evaluate the uterine cavity for any abnormalities. This can be done through imaging or direct visualization. Options A and B, TVS (transvaginal ultrasound) and hysteroscopy, are both methods to directly visualize the uterine cavity. Option C, endometrial biopsy, is not the most appropriate investigation in this case as it primarily evaluates the endometrium and not the uterine cavity. Option D, chromosomal abnormalities, may be considered later in the evaluation if other investigations are inconclusive. Therefore, the most appropriate next investigation to advise would be B. hysteroscopy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
