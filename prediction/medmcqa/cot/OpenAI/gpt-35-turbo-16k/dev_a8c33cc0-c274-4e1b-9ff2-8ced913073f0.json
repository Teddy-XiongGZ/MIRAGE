    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Alginate impression material is a type of irreversible hydrocolloid material, while agar-agar impression material is a type of reversible hydrocolloid material. The question is asking for similarities between the two materials. A. Gelation increases in both on increase in temperature: This statement is not true. Alginate impression material undergoes gelation by a chemical reaction, while agar-agar impression material undergoes gelation by a physical process of cooling. Therefore, the gelation of alginate is not affected by temperature, while the gelation of agar-agar is affected by temperature. B. Mixing time is increased to reduce the setting time: This statement is not true for alginate impression material. Alginate has a fixed setting time, and increasing the mixing time will not reduce the setting time. C. Deformation during removal of impression occurs due to distortion of gel fibers: This statement is true for both alginate and agar-agar impression materials. During the removal of the impression, the gel fibers can get distorted, leading to deformation of the impression. D. Both can be re-used for fresh impressions: This statement is not true for alginate impression material. Alginate is a single-use material and cannot be re-used for fresh impressions. Agar-agar impression material, on the other hand, can be melted and re-used for fresh impressions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
