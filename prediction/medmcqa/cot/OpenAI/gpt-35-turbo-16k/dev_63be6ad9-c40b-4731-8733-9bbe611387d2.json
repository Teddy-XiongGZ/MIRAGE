    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Composite restorations are a type of dental filling material that is commonly used to restore decayed or damaged teeth. They have several advantages, such as being tooth-colored and aesthetically pleasing. However, they also have some disadvantages. To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Greater localized occlusal wear: Composite restorations are generally more prone to wear compared to other materials like amalgam. This is because composites are not as hard as natural tooth structure or other restorative materials.\\n\\nB. Recurrent secondary caries: Composite restorations can be more susceptible to recurrent decay compared to other materials. This is because composites have a higher chance of developing gaps or marginal leakage over time, which can lead to the formation of secondary caries.\\n\\nC. Technique sensitive: Composite restorations require meticulous technique and attention to detail during placement. They are sensitive to factors such as moisture control, proper isolation, and proper bonding techniques.\\n\\nD. More time in replacement: Composite restorations may require more time to replace compared to other materials. This is because the old composite needs to be carefully removed, and the tooth needs to be properly prepared before a new composite can be placed.\\n\\nBased on the above evaluation, it can be concluded that the correct answer is option C. Technique sensitive.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
