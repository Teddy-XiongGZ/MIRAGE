    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the placement of graft failure, we need to understand the different classes of recession. Class I recession involves recession of the gingival margin without loss of interdental papilla. Class II recession involves recession of the gingival margin with loss of interdental papilla. Class III recession involves recession of the gingival margin with loss of interdental papilla extending to or beyond the mucogingival junction. Class IV recession involves recession of the gingival margin with loss of interdental papilla extending to or beyond the mucogingival junction, with severe bone or soft tissue loss. Based on this information, the placement of graft is more likely to fail in Class IV recession, as it involves severe bone or soft tissue loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Class IV\"}"
