    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the angle subtended by the largest letter in the Snellen chart, we need to use the formula: angle = size / distance. The size of the largest letter in the Snellen chart is standardized to be 5 minutes of arc. The distance at which the person is reading the chart is given as 6 meters. Therefore, the angle subtended by the largest letter can be calculated as angle = 5 minutes / 6 meters. To convert minutes to degrees, we need to know that 1 minute is equal to 1/60 degrees.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
