    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RBC (Red Blood Cells) are typically stored at a temperature of 2-6oC to maintain their viability and prevent spoilage. Platelets, on the other hand, are stored at a slightly higher temperature of 20-22oC to maintain their functionality. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) is stored at a temperature of -30oC to preserve its clotting factors and other components. Therefore, the correct storage temperatures are RBC 2-6oC, Platelet 20-22oC, and FFP -30oC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
