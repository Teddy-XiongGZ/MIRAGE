    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which cement is irritating to the pulp, we need to consider the properties of each cement. Carboxylate cement is known for its biocompatibility and low irritation potential. Zinc oxide-eugenol cement is also generally well-tolerated by the pulp. Zinc phosphate cement is known for its excellent strength and durability, but it can be irritating to the pulp due to its acidic nature. Ethoxybenzoic acid is not commonly used as a dental cement, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Zinc phosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
