    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infective stage of hepatitis B is determined by the presence of specific antigens. HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is the first antigen to appear during infection and is present during the acute and chronic phases of the disease. HBeAg (Hepatitis B e antigen) is a marker of active viral replication and indicates a high level of infectivity. HBcAg (Hepatitis B core antigen) is not directly involved in infectivity but is used as a marker for the presence of the virus. Anti-HBs (antibodies to HBsAg) is an antibody that develops after recovery from acute infection or after vaccination. Therefore, the correct answer is B. HBe Ag.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
