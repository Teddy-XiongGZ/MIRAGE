    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Energy storage capacity in orthodontic wire refers to its ability to store and release energy during the orthodontic treatment process. This energy is used to apply forces to the teeth and move them into the desired position. A. Range: Range refers to the ability of the wire to be bent or deformed without breaking. It does not directly relate to energy storage capacity. B. Resilience: Resilience refers to the ability of the wire to return to its original shape after being deformed. While resilience is important for orthodontic wires, it does not specifically describe energy storage capacity. C. Formability: Formability refers to the ease with which the wire can be shaped and manipulated. While formability is important for orthodontic wires, it does not directly relate to energy storage capacity. D. Proportional limit: Proportional limit refers to the maximum stress that a wire can withstand without permanent deformation. It is directly related to energy storage capacity, as a wire with a higher proportional limit can store and release more energy during orthodontic treatment. Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is D. Proportional limit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
