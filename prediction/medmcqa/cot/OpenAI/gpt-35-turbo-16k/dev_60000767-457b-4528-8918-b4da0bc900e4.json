    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"High copper amalgam alloy is known for its improved properties compared to traditional amalgam alloys. Let's go through each option to determine which one is a characteristic feature of high copper amalgam alloy. \\n\\nA. Low compressive strength: High copper amalgam alloy actually has higher compressive strength compared to traditional amalgam alloys, so this is not a characteristic feature. \\n\\nB. High marginal breakdown: High copper amalgam alloy has improved marginal integrity and resistance to marginal breakdown, so this is not a characteristic feature. \\n\\nC. Less marginal #: High copper amalgam alloy has better marginal adaptation and less marginal leakage, so this is a characteristic feature. \\n\\nD. High creep: High copper amalgam alloy has reduced creep and better dimensional stability, so this is not a characteristic feature. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the characteristic feature of high copper amalgam alloy is less marginal #.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
