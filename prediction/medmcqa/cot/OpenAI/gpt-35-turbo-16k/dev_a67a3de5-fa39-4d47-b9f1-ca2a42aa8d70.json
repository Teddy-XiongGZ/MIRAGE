Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Scrub technique: This technique involves vigorously scrubbing the teeth back and forth. However, this technique can be abrasive and may cause damage to the gums and tooth enamel, so it is not typically recommended for periodontal patients.\\n\\nB. Roll technique: This technique involves rolling the toothbrush bristles along the gumline. It is a gentle technique that can effectively remove plaque and debris without causing excessive pressure or irritation. However, it may not be the most frequently recommended technique for periodontal patients.\\n\\nC. Sulcular technique: This technique involves angling the toothbrush bristles towards the gumline and gently brushing in a circular motion. It is specifically designed to clean the area where the gums meet the teeth, which is a common site for plaque buildup in periodontal patients. This technique is often recommended for periodontal patients.\\n\\nD. Fones technique: This technique involves using large, sweeping motions to brush the teeth and gums. It is not specifically designed for periodontal patients and may not effectively remove plaque and debris from the gumline.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the most frequently recommended tooth brushing technique for periodontal patients is the sulcular technique (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
