    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hepatic first pass metabolism refers to the metabolism of a drug that occurs in the liver before it reaches systemic circulation. This process can significantly reduce the bioavailability of a drug. The routes of drug administration that bypass hepatic first pass metabolism are those that do not involve absorption through the gastrointestinal tract and subsequent transport to the liver. A. Oral administration involves ingestion of the drug, which is then absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. This route of administration does not bypass hepatic first pass metabolism. B. Intravenous administration involves direct injection of the drug into a vein, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and liver. This route of administration bypasses hepatic first pass metabolism. C. Sublingual administration involves placing the drug under the tongue, where it is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the sublingual mucosa. This route of administration bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and liver, thus bypassing hepatic first pass metabolism. D. Intradermal administration involves injecting the drug into the dermis, which is the layer of skin below the epidermis. This route of administration does not bypass hepatic first pass metabolism. Based on the above information, the route of drug administration that bypasses hepatic first pass metabolism is B. Intravenous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
