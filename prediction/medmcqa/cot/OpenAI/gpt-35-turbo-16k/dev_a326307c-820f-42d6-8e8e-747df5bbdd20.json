    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"An expansion of 90\u00b0 in an expansion screw refers to the rotation of the screw. To determine the expansion caused by this rotation, we need to know the pitch of the screw. The pitch is the distance the screw moves forward with one complete rotation. Without knowing the pitch, we cannot accurately determine the expansion caused by a 90\u00b0 rotation. Therefore, we cannot provide a definite answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"N/A\"}"
