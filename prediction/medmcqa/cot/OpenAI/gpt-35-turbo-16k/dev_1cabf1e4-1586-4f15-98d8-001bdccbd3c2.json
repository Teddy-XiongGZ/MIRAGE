    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Vitamin K is known to play a crucial role in blood clotting. It is required for the synthesis of clotting factors in the liver. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that vitamin K antagonizes the production of clotting factors by the liver. Corticosteroids are not directly related to vitamin K. Thrombin formation is actually promoted by vitamin K, so it is not antagonized by it. Bishydroxy coumarin is a type of anticoagulant that inhibits the action of vitamin K, but it is not the antagonist itself. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Production of clotting factors by liver.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
