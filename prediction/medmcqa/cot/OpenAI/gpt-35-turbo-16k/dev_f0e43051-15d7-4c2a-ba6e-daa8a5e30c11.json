    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The normal number of chromosomes in a human cell is 46. Therefore, any condition that deviates from this number may indicate a chromosomal abnormality. Turner's syndrome is caused by a missing or partially missing X chromosome, resulting in 45 chromosomes. Down's syndrome, on the other hand, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, resulting in 47 chromosomes.
