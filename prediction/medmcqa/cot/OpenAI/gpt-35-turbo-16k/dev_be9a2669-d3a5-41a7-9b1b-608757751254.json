    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"RBCs, or red blood cells, are typically stored in blood banks for transfusion purposes. To maintain the viability and function of RBCs, they need to be stored at specific temperatures. Let's evaluate the options: \\n\\nA. -2 to -4 degC: This temperature range is too low and can cause damage to the RBCs. \\nB. 2-6 degC: This temperature range is commonly used for storing RBCs. It helps to slow down the metabolic processes and prolong the shelf life of the cells. \\nC. 20-25 degC: This temperature range is too high and can lead to the rapid deterioration of RBCs. \\nD. 37 degC: This temperature is body temperature and is not suitable for storing RBCs as it would promote rapid degradation. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. 2-6 degC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
