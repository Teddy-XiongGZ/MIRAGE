    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a component of the immune system that is primarily located in the gastrointestinal tract. To determine the location of GALT, we need to understand the layers of the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal tract consists of four main layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa. GALT is primarily located in the mucosa layer of the gastrointestinal tract. The mucosa layer is further divided into three layers: epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosae. GALT is specifically located in the lamina propria, which is the connective tissue layer beneath the epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
