    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Maternal mortality ratio is a measure of the number of maternal deaths per a specific number of live births or pregnancies. It is usually expressed as a ratio or a rate. To determine the correct choice, we need to consider the magnitude of the ratio. Maternal mortality is relatively rare, so the denominator should be a large number to accurately reflect the ratio. A. Maternal death per 10,000 lives seems too low, as it would not adequately capture the occurrence of maternal deaths. D. Maternal death per 100 lives also seems too low, as it would result in a very high ratio. C. Maternal death per 1,000,000 lives seems too high, as it would result in a very low ratio. B. Maternal death per 100,000 lives seems like a reasonable choice, as it provides a balance between capturing the occurrence of maternal deaths and maintaining a manageable ratio.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
