    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When investigating a lesion of the temporal bone, the first step is to consider the imaging modality that provides the best visualization of the bone and surrounding structures. X-ray is not the ideal choice as it provides limited information about soft tissues. USG (ultrasound) is also not commonly used for imaging the temporal bone. CT (computed tomography) is often the investigation of choice for evaluating bony structures and can provide detailed images of the temporal bone. However, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating soft tissues and can provide excellent visualization of the temporal bone and its surrounding structures. Therefore, the investigation of choice for a lesion of the temporal bone is D. MRI.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
