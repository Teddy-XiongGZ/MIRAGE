    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Postural hypotension refers to a drop in blood pressure that occurs when a person stands up from a sitting or lying position. It is also known as orthostatic hypotension. The key feature of postural hypotension is a decrease in blood pressure upon standing. The question asks about the criteria for this decrease in blood pressure. To answer the question, we need to determine the correct values for the decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as the time frame within which this decrease occurs. Option A states that the decrease in systolic blood pressure should be 20 mmHg within 6 minutes. Option B states that the decrease in systolic blood pressure should be 20 mmHg within 3 minutes. Option C states that the decrease in diastolic blood pressure should be 20 mmHg within 6 minutes. Option D states that the decrease in diastolic blood pressure should be 20 mmHg within 3 minutes. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the typical criteria for diagnosing postural hypotension. According to medical guidelines, a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing is considered diagnostic for postural hypotension. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
