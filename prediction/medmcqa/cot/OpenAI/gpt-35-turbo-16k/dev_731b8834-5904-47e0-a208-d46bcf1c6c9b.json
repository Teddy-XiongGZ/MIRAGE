    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In 3rd nerve palsy, the oculomotor nerve is affected, which controls the movement of the eye muscles, as well as the pupillary reflex. The oculomotor nerve also innervates the muscles that control the size of the pupil. Therefore, in 3rd nerve palsy, we would expect to see abnormalities in the movement of the eye muscles, such as ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) and outward upward rolling of the pupil. Additionally, the pupillary reflex would be impaired, leading to abnormal pupil dilation. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. Pupil dilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
