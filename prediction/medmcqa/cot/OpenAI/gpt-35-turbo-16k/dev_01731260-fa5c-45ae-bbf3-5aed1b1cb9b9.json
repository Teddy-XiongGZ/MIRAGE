    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The periodontal ligament is a specialized connective tissue that surrounds and attaches teeth to the alveolar bone. It is composed of various types of cells, including fibroblasts, cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and rests of Malassez. Cementoblasts are responsible for the formation of cementum, which covers the root surface of the tooth. Osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation. Rests of Malassez are remnants of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath. Fibroblasts are the predominant connective tissue cells of the periodontal ligament, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and function of the ligament. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Fibroblasts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
