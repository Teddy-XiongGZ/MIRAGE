    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cervical resorption after bleaching is a potential complication that can occur due to the chemical and mechanical effects of the bleaching process. To prevent cervical resorption, it is important to consider the factors that contribute to its occurrence. Option A, 80% alcohol drying immediately after bleaching, is not effective in preventing cervical resorption. Alcohol drying may help in removing excess moisture but it does not directly prevent resorption. Option B, Alpha tocopherol applied immediately after bleaching, is not a commonly used method for preventing cervical resorption. Alpha tocopherol, also known as vitamin E, has antioxidant properties but its direct effect on preventing cervical resorption is not well-established. Option C, Sodium perborate + sodium hypochlorite, is not an effective combination for preventing cervical resorption. Sodium perborate is commonly used as a bleaching agent, and sodium hypochlorite is a disinfectant. While these agents may have their own benefits, they do not specifically prevent cervical resorption. Option D, Sodium perborate + calcium hydroxide, is the most effective choice for preventing cervical resorption after bleaching. Sodium perborate is a bleaching agent, and calcium hydroxide is an alkaline substance that helps in neutralizing the acidic effects of the bleaching process. This combination helps in minimizing the risk of cervical resorption by maintaining a more favorable pH balance in the tooth structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
