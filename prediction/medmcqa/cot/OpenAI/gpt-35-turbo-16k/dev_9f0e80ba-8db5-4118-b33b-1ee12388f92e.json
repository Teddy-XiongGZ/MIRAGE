    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The edge angle is the angle between two specific surfaces on a cutting tool. To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the definitions of the terms provided in the choices. The rake face is the surface of the cutting tool that is in contact with the material being cut. The clearance face is the surface that provides clearance for the chip to flow away from the cutting edge. The radial line is an imaginary line that extends from the center of the cutting tool to the cutting edge. Option A states that the edge angle is between the rake face and the radial line. This does not accurately describe the edge angle. Option B states that the edge angle is between the rake face and the clearance face. This is a possible definition of the edge angle, as it represents the angle between the two surfaces that are directly involved in the cutting process. Option C states that the edge angle is between the clearance face and the tooth structure. This does not accurately describe the edge angle. Option D states that the edge angle is between the radial line and the clearance face. This does not accurately describe the edge angle. Based on the definitions provided, the correct answer is B. Rake face and clearance face.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
