    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The strength of collagen is due to the presence of specific amino acids that contribute to its structure. Collagen is primarily composed of three amino acids: glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in collagen and provides flexibility to the collagen fibers. Proline and hydroxyproline contribute to the stability and strength of collagen by forming cross-links between the collagen molecules. Hydroxyproline is derived from proline through a post-translational modification. Therefore, the strength of collagen is primarily due to the presence of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
