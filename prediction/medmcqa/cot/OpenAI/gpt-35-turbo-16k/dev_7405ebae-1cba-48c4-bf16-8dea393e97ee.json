    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A non-working condyle refers to the condyle on the opposite side of the mandible during a specific movement. In this case, we are looking for the movements performed by the non-working condyle. The non-working condyle moves in the opposite direction of the working condyle. The working condyle moves downwards, forwards, and medially during the closing movement of the jaw. Therefore, the non-working condyle would move upwards, backwards, and laterally. None of the given options match this movement, so the answer is none of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
