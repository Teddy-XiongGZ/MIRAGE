    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"ZOE based sealer refers to a sealer that is made from zinc oxide and eugenol. Let's evaluate each option one by one:\\n\\nA. Expands on setting & hence provide impervious seal: This is true for ZOE based sealers. When the sealer sets, it expands and provides a tight seal.\\n\\nB. Absorb if extruded periapically: This is also true for ZOE based sealers. If the sealer is extruded beyond the apex of the tooth, it can be absorbed.\\n\\nC. Antibacterial, so prevent entombing of Bacterial: This is true for ZOE based sealers. They have antibacterial properties that help prevent the entombing of bacteria.\\n\\nD. Slow setting, so results in increased inflammation initially: This statement is not true for ZOE based sealers. They have a relatively fast setting time and do not typically result in increased inflammation initially.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Slow setting, so results in increased inflammation initially.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
