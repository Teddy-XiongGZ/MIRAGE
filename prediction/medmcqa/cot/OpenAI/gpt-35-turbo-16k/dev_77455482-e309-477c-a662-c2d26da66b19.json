    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glycogen phosphorylase is an important enzyme in the glycogenolysis pathway, which is responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose. It requires several cofactors for its activity. Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein that activates glycogen phosphorylase, so it is a cofactor. c-AMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger that activates protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase. Therefore, c-AMP and PKA are also cofactors for glycogen phosphorylase. Glycogenin, on the other hand, is not a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase. Glycogenin is an enzyme that initiates glycogen synthesis by catalyzing the formation of a short glucose chain that serves as the primer for glycogen synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Glycogenin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
