    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The oxygen carrying capacity of blood is determined by the hemoglobin concentration. Each gram of hemoglobin can carry approximately 1.34 mL of oxygen. To calculate the oxygen carrying capacity, we need to multiply the hemoglobin concentration by the conversion factor of 1.34 mL/g. Therefore, the oxygen carrying capacity of the patient can be calculated as 14 g/dL * 1.34 mL/g = 18.76 mL/dL. Since the question asks for the answer in mL/dL, the closest option is C. 18.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
