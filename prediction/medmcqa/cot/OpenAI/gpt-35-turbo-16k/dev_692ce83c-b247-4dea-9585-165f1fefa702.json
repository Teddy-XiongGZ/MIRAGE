    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Retentive pin holes are used to provide additional retention for restorations. The direction of placement of retentive pin holes should be considered carefully to ensure optimal retention and stability of the restoration. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Perpendicular to external tooth surface: Placing retentive pin holes perpendicular to the external tooth surface may not provide sufficient retention as the pins may not engage the tooth structure effectively.\\n\\nB. Parallel to external tooth surface: Placing retentive pin holes parallel to the external tooth surface allows the pins to engage the tooth structure more effectively, providing better retention.\\n\\nC. Parallel to other pins: This option is not relevant to the direction of placement of retentive pin holes.\\n\\nD. Never beneath cusps to be restored: Placing retentive pin holes beneath cusps to be restored can weaken the tooth structure and compromise the integrity of the restoration. Therefore, it is generally not recommended.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is B. Parallel to external tooth surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
