    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs, but can also affect other organs such as the pancreas, liver, and intestines. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that both copies of the CFTR gene must be mutated for a person to have CF. The CFTR protein is responsible for regulating the movement of chloride ions across cell membranes, which in turn affects the movement of water and salt in and out of cells. This abnormality in CFTR function leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that can clog the airways and other organs. Therefore, statement B is not true, as CF is not caused by an abnormality in CFTR that leads to defective calcium transport.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
