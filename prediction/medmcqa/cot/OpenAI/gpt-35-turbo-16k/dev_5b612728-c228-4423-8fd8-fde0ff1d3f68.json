    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the criteria for an infant at risk, we need to consider various factors that may increase the risk for the infant. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Working mothers: While being a working mother may have its own challenges, it is not a specific criteria for an infant being at risk.\\n\\nB. Have not taken 100 days folic acid: Folic acid supplementation is important for the prevention of certain birth defects, but not taking it for 100 days alone does not necessarily make an infant at risk.\\n\\nC. Preclampsia in pregnancy: Preclampsia is a condition characterized by high blood pressure and organ damage during pregnancy. It can increase the risk for both the mother and the infant, making this a potential criteria for an infant at risk.\\n\\nD. Malpresentation during birth: Malpresentation refers to abnormal positioning of the fetus during birth, such as breech or transverse presentation. This can increase the risk for complications during delivery, but it does not necessarily make the infant at risk.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the correct answer is C. Preclampsia in pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
