    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The best diagnostic investigation for acute appendicitis in children is typically ultrasound (USG). This is because USG is non-invasive, readily available, and does not involve exposure to ionizing radiation. It can accurately visualize the appendix and surrounding structures, allowing for the detection of signs of inflammation such as an enlarged appendix, thickened walls, and the presence of fluid or abscess. MRI (option A) can also be used for diagnosing appendicitis, but it is less commonly used in children due to its higher cost and limited availability. CT scan (option B) can provide detailed images of the appendix, but it involves exposure to ionizing radiation, which is a concern in children. X-ray (option D) is not typically used for diagnosing appendicitis as it does not provide sufficient visualization of the appendix and surrounding structures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
