    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mandibular premolars are the premolars located in the lower jaw, while maxillary premolars are the premolars located in the upper jaw. To determine the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars, we need to consider the characteristics of the mandibular premolars. A. The buccal and lingual cusps are more prominent: This statement does not accurately describe the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars. The prominence of the cusps can vary between individuals and is not specific to mandibular premolars. B. The lingual cusp is sharper and longer: This statement does not accurately describe the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars. The shape and length of the cusps can vary between individuals and is not specific to mandibular premolars. C. The lingual surface rounded and less developed: This statement accurately describes the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars. Mandibular premolars typically have a rounded and less developed lingual surface compared to maxillary premolars. D. The buccal surface is rounded and less developed: This statement does not accurately describe the difference between mandibular and maxillary premolars. The shape and development of the buccal surface can vary between individuals and is not specific to mandibular premolars. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. The lingual surface is rounded and less developed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
