    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the supporting structures of the teeth, including the periodontal fibres. The breakdown of periodontal fibres in periodontitis is primarily due to the action of bacterial enzymes. Collagenase is an enzyme that specifically breaks down collagen, which is a major component of the periodontal fibres. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, which is not a major component of the periodontal fibres. Coagulase is an enzyme that promotes blood clotting and is not directly involved in the breakdown of periodontal fibres. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Collagenase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
