    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The term 'sharpest cusp' refers to the pointy or sharp tip of a tooth. To determine which tooth has the sharpest cusp, we need to consider the anatomy of each tooth. Both canines and premolars have cusps, but canines typically have a single cusp while premolars have multiple cusps. The upper canines are known for their long and pointed cusps, which are used for tearing and cutting food. On the other hand, lower canines have a slightly less sharp cusp compared to the upper canines. Upper premolars usually have two cusps, one larger and one smaller, but they are not as sharp as the cusps of the canines. Lower premolars also have two cusps, but they are generally flatter and less sharp than the upper premolars. Based on this information, the tooth with the sharpest cusp is the Upper Canine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
