    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the drugs can be stopped abruptly without any withdrawal symptoms, we need to consider the characteristics of each drug. Withdrawal symptoms occur when the body becomes dependent on a drug and experiences discomfort or distress when the drug is suddenly discontinued. A. Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Abruptly stopping escitalopram can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, headache, and mood changes. B. Fluoxetine is also an SSRI used to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. However, fluoxetine has a longer half-life compared to other SSRIs, which means it stays in the body for a longer time. This longer half-life helps to minimize withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing fluoxetine. Therefore, fluoxetine can be stopped abruptly without significant withdrawal symptoms. C. Fluvoxamine is another SSRI used primarily to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Abruptly stopping fluvoxamine can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, headache, and irritability. D. Sertraline is an SSRI commonly used to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. Abruptly stopping sertraline can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, headache, and mood changes. Based on the information provided, the drug that can be stopped abruptly without any withdrawal symptoms is B. Fluoxetine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
