    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Delayed neuronal migration and organization can lead to various disorders characterized by abnormal brain development. Lissencephaly is a disorder where the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves, which is caused by impaired neuronal migration. Schizencephaly is a disorder characterized by abnormal clefts or cleft-like spaces in the brain, also caused by impaired neuronal migration. Polymicrogyria is a disorder where the brain has an excessive number of small, abnormal folds, again caused by impaired neuronal migration. Focal cortical dysplasia without balloon cells is a disorder characterized by abnormal development of a specific area of the brain, but it is not typically associated with delayed neuronal migration. Therefore, the least likely possibility among the given options is D. Focal cortical dysplasia without balloon cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
