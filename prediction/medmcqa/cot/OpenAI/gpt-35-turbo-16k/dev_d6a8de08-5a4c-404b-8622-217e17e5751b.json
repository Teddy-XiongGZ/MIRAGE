Dysphagia: Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing, which can occur after a stroke due to muscle weakness or coordination problems. If left untreated, dysphagia can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, and aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, dysphagia needs to be treated.\\n\\nD. Numbness: Numbness is a common symptom of stroke caused by damage to the nerves. While it may not require specific treatment, it is important to address the underlying cause of the stroke and manage any associated complications. Therefore, numbness should be evaluated and managed as part of the overall stroke treatment. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, all of the complications mentioned in the options need to be treated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
