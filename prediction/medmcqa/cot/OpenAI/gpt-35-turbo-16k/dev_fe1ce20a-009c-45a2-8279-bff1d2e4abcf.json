    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the number of patients with blood pressures between the 3rd and 4th quartile, we need to find the range of blood pressures between these two quartiles. The 3rd quartile represents the upper 75% of the data, and the 4th quartile represents the upper 100% of the data. Therefore, the range between the 3rd and 4th quartile includes all the data points above the 3rd quartile. Since the 3rd quartile is 110 mm Hg, all the patients with blood pressures above 110 mm Hg will fall between the 3rd and 4th quartile.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 200\"}"
