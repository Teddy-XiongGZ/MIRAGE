    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In obstructed jaundice due to gallstones, there is a blockage in the bile ducts, which prevents the flow of bile from the liver to the intestines. Urobilinogen is a breakdown product of bilirubin, which is formed in the liver and excreted in the bile. In obstructed jaundice, the flow of bile is obstructed, leading to a buildup of bilirubin in the liver and a decrease in its excretion. As a result, urobilinogen levels will be decreased or completely absent in obstructed jaundice due to gallstones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Completely absent\"}"
