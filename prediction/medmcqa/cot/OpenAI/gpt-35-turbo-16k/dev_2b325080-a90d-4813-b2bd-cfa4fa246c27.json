    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the material from which plastic carrier size of 40-90 in carrier base Gutta percha are made from, we need to consider the properties of each potential choice. \\n\\nA. Poly propylene: Polypropylene is a commonly used plastic material due to its high strength and resistance to chemicals. However, it is not typically used in the production of carrier base Gutta percha. \\n\\nB. Poly Sulphone: Poly sulphone is a high-performance thermoplastic known for its excellent mechanical properties and resistance to heat and chemicals. It is a potential candidate for the production of carrier base Gutta percha. \\n\\nC. Poly Sulphide: Poly sulphide is a type of synthetic rubber that is known for its excellent resistance to chemicals and solvents. However, it is not commonly used in the production of plastic carrier base Gutta percha. \\n\\nD. Liquid crystal plastic: Liquid crystal plastic is a type of polymer that exhibits liquid crystal behavior. It is not typically used in the production of carrier base Gutta percha. \\n\\nBased on these considerations, the most likely material from which plastic carrier size of 40-90 in carrier base Gutta percha are made from is Poly Sulphone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
