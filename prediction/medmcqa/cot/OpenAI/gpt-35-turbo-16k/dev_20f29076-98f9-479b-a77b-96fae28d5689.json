The abdominal CT reveals a left perinephric hematoma with a 3 cm angiomyolipoma and multiple right renal angiomyolipomas measuring 1.5 to 6.5 cm. Angiomyolipomas are benign tumors composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle cells, and fat. They are commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC), which is characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organs.
