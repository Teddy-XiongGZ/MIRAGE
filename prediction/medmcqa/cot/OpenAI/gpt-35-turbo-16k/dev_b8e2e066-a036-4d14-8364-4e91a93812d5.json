    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, there is a decrease in insulin levels or insulin resistance. Insulin plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. Therefore, in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, there is a decrease in the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and an increase in the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). LPL is responsible for the breakdown of triglycerides in circulating lipoproteins, while HSL is responsible for the breakdown of stored triglycerides in adipose tissue. As a result, there is an increase in triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase and decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
