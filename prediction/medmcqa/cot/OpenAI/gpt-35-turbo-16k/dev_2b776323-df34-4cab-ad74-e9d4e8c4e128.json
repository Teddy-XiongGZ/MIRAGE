    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To have antirotational stability of the instrument, the distance of the blade from the shank should be sufficient to prevent rotation. This can be achieved by having a longer blade that extends further from the shank. The longer the blade, the more stability it provides. Therefore, the distance of the blade from the shank to have antirotational stability of the instrument should be greater than 2 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm. The correct answer is D. 5 mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
