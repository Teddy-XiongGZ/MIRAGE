    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the tooth with the smallest root, we need to consider the anatomy of the teeth. The mandibular central incisor typically has a single root, making it unlikely to be the tooth with the smallest root. The mandibular lateral incisor also usually has a single root, so it is also unlikely to be the answer. The maxillary lateral incisor usually has a single root as well, so it is also unlikely to be the tooth with the smallest root. The maxillary 1st premolar, on the other hand, typically has two roots, making it a potential candidate for the tooth with the smallest root. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. Maxillary 1st premolar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
