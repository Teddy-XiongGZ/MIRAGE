    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Golgi tendon organ is a sensory receptor located in the tendons of skeletal muscles. It is responsible for detecting changes in muscle tension or force. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. High threshold: This is true. The Golgi tendon organ has a high threshold, meaning it requires a significant amount of force to activate.\\n\\nB. Dynamic response only: This is false. The Golgi tendon organ has both dynamic and static responses, meaning it can detect both rapid changes in muscle tension and sustained muscle contractions.\\n\\nC. Detects length change: This is false. The Golgi tendon organ detects changes in muscle tension, not changes in muscle length.\\n\\nD. 3-25 muscle fibers: This is true. Each Golgi tendon organ is innervated by 3-25 muscle fibers, allowing for a more accurate representation of muscle tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
