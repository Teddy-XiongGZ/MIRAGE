    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this question, we are looking for the type of analytical study where the population is the unit of study. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Cross-sectional: In a cross-sectional study, data is collected at a single point in time from a population or a representative sample. However, the unit of study is not the population itself.\\n\\nB. Ecological: In an ecological study, data is collected at the population level, and the unit of study is indeed the population. This type of study examines the relationship between exposure and outcome at the population level.\\n\\nC. Case-control: In a case-control study, individuals with a specific outcome (cases) are compared to individuals without the outcome (controls). The unit of study is not the population, but rather the cases and controls.\\n\\nD. Cohort study: In a cohort study, a group of individuals is followed over time to determine the occurrence of outcomes. While the population is involved in a cohort study, the unit of study is the individual within the population.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Ecological.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
