    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a condition characterized by a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) due to the destruction of platelets by auto-antibodies. Let's evaluate each statement to determine which one is NOT true. \\n\\nA. It is associated with platelet-specific auto-antibodies: This statement is true. ITP is caused by the production of auto-antibodies that target platelets, leading to their destruction.\\n\\nB. It causes a prolonged bleeding time: This statement is true. With a low platelet count, the ability of blood to clot is impaired, resulting in a prolonged bleeding time.\\n\\nC. It is often controllable by immunosuppressive treatment: This statement is true. Immunosuppressive treatment, such as corticosteroids or immunoglobulins, can help control the immune response and increase platelet count in ITP.\\n\\nD. It causes more prolonged hemorrhage than hemophilia: This statement is NOT true. Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factors, while ITP primarily affects platelet count. ITP does not typically cause more prolonged hemorrhage than hemophilia. \\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is D. It causes more prolonged hemorrhage than hemophilia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
