    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The growth of nasal bone refers to the completion of its development. To determine when this occurs, we need to consider the normal growth and development of the human body. The nasal bone is a part of the skull, which continues to grow and develop until the individual reaches skeletal maturity. Skeletal maturity is typically reached around the age of 18-21 years. However, the growth of specific bones, such as the nasal bone, may complete earlier than this. To determine the completion of nasal bone growth, we need to consider the average age at which skeletal maturity is reached and any specific information regarding the growth of the nasal bone. None of the options provided (10 years, 11 years, 13 years, or 7 years) align with the typical age of completion of nasal bone growth. Therefore, none of the options provided are correct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
