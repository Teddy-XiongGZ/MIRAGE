    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A mosaic pattern of bone refers to a radiographic appearance where there are alternating areas of increased and decreased bone density. This pattern is typically seen in conditions where there is abnormal bone remodeling. Fibrous dysplasia is a condition characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue, resulting in areas of increased and decreased bone density. Paget's disease is a condition characterized by excessive bone remodeling, leading to areas of increased and disorganized bone formation. Osteopetrosis is a condition characterized by increased bone density due to defective bone resorption. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a condition characterized by brittle bones due to defects in collagen synthesis. Among the given options, the condition most commonly associated with a mosaic pattern of bone is Paget's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
