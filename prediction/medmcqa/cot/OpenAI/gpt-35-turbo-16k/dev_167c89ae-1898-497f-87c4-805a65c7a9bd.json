    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Supporting cusps occlude in the embrasures. The embrasures are the spaces between adjacent teeth, and they allow for proper alignment and occlusion of the cusps. The central fossa is a depression on the occlusal surface of a tooth, and it does not directly contribute to the occlusion of cusps. The marginal ridges are the raised borders of the tooth that help maintain the integrity of the tooth structure, but they do not directly occlude the cusps. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Embrasures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
