    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Reflexes are involuntary movements or actions that occur in response to a specific stimulus. They are typically present at birth and gradually disappear as the baby grows and develops. To determine which reflex appears at birth, we need to evaluate each option. \\n\\nA. Landau reflex: The Landau reflex is a postural reflex that emerges around 3-4 months of age. It involves the baby's body straightening and lifting the head and legs when held in a horizontal position. Therefore, the Landau reflex does not appear at birth. \\n\\nB. Babinski reflex: The Babinski reflex is a reflex that involves the fanning and curling of the toes when the sole of the foot is stroked. It is present at birth and typically disappears by the age of 1. \\n\\nC. Startle reflex: The startle reflex, also known as the Moro reflex, is a reflex that occurs when a baby is startled by a sudden noise or movement. It involves the baby extending their arms and legs, then bringing them back in towards their body. Therefore, the startle reflex (Moro's reflex) does appear at birth. \\n\\nD. Moro's reflex: As mentioned above, the startle reflex is also known as Moro's reflex. It is present at birth and typically disappears by the age of 3-6 months. \\n\\nBased on this information, the reflex that does not appear at birth is the Landau reflex (option A).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
