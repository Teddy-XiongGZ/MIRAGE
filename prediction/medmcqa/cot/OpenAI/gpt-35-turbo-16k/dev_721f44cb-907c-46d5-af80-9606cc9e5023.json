    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"TMJ stands for temporomandibular joint, which is the joint that connects the jawbone to the skull. To determine the type of joint it is, we can consider its structure and function. The TMJ allows for both rotational and sliding movements, which are necessary for activities such as chewing and speaking. Based on this information, we can conclude that the TMJ is not a ball and socket joint (A) because it does not have the same range of motion as the shoulder or hip joints. It is also not a hinge and axis joint (B) because it allows for more than just a simple opening and closing motion. A synovial joint (C) is a type of joint that is characterized by the presence of a synovial membrane and synovial fluid, which helps to lubricate and cushion the joint. The TMJ does have a synovial membrane and synovial fluid, so it can be classified as a synovial joint. Finally, a diarthrodal joint (D) is another term for a synovial joint, so both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we can choose either C or D as the correct choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C or D\"}"
