    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The auditory pathway starts from the peripheral auditory system and progresses towards the central auditory system. The sequence is as follows: Cochlear nucleus (B) receives input from the cochlea and is located in the brainstem. From there, the signal travels to the superior olivary complex (A), which is responsible for sound localization. Next, the signal passes through the inferior colliculus (D), which is involved in auditory processing. Finally, the signal reaches the medial geniculate body (C) in the thalamus, which relays the auditory information to the auditory cortex. Therefore, the correct sequence is B>A>D>C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
