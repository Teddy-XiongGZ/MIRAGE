However, this reflex disappears after a few months.\\n\\nB. Limb placement reflex: This reflex is a protective response that causes the limb to be placed in a position to avoid injury. It is present in newborns and persists throughout life.\\n\\nC. Parachute reflex: This reflex is a protective response that causes the arms to extend when a person feels like they are falling. It is present in infants and persists throughout life.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Parachute reflex, as it is the only reflex listed that never disappears.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
