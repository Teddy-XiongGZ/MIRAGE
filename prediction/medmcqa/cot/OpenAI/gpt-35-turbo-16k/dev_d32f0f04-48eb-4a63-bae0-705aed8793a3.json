    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The binding of eukaryotic mRNA to ribosomes is facilitated by the presence of a cap structure at the 5' end of the mRNA. This cap structure, known as capping, helps in the recognition and binding of the mRNA to the ribosomes. The poly-A tail, on the other hand, is present at the 3' end of the mRNA and is involved in mRNA stability and transport. tRNA is responsible for carrying amino acids to the ribosomes during protein synthesis, but it is not directly involved in the binding of mRNA to ribosomes. The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is a prokaryotic-specific sequence that helps in the recognition and binding of mRNA to ribosomes in prokaryotes, but it is not present in eukaryotes. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Capping.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
