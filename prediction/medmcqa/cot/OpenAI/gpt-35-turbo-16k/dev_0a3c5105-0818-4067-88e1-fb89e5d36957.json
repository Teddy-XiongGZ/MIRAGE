    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When choosing a prefabricated post preparation system in mandibular molar, several factors need to be considered. The first factor is the type of post preparation system. The two main types are tapered and parallel. Tapered posts have a conical shape, which allows for better retention and stability. Parallel posts have a cylindrical shape and are easier to insert. The second factor is the method of retention. Screwed-in posts are more secure and less likely to dislodge compared to passively cemented posts. Partial cementation refers to a post that is cemented only partially, leaving a portion of the post exposed. Based on these considerations, the preferred type of prefabricated post preparation system in mandibular molar would be a tapered post that is screwed in. This provides both good retention and stability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
