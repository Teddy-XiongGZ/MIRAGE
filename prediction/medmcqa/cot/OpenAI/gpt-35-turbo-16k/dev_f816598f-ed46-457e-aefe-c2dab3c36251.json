    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Placenta accreta is a condition where the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Seen in cesarean scar: Placenta accreta can occur in the area of a previous cesarean scar, but it can also occur in other parts of the uterus.\\n\\nB. Removal should be done under GA in piecemeal: The management of placenta accreta involves a multidisciplinary approach and may include a combination of medical management, conservative surgical management, or hysterectomy. The method of removal may vary depending on the severity of the condition and the patient's individual circumstances. Piecemeal removal is not a standard approach.\\n\\nC. Chorionic villi invade serosa: Placenta accreta occurs when the chorionic villi, which are part of the placenta, invade the myometrium (the muscular layer of the uterus) but do not invade the serosa (the outermost layer of the uterus).\\n\\nD. It is an etiological factor for amniotic fluid embolism: Placenta accreta is not directly associated with amniotic fluid embolism, which is a rare but serious condition where amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation. These two conditions have different etiologies and mechanisms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
