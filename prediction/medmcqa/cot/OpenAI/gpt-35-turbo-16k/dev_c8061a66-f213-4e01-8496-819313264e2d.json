    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When an excessive amount of monomer is incorporated into an acrylic resin mixture, it can lead to changes in the properties of the final product. Let's consider each option: A) Excessive expansion is unlikely to occur because excessive monomer would result in a higher liquid-to-powder ratio, which would lead to a more fluid mixture and less expansion. B) Low impact strength is possible because excessive monomer can weaken the overall structure of the resin. C) Excessive shrinkage is a more likely outcome because the excess monomer can cause the resin to contract more during polymerization. D) Excessive brittleness is also possible because the excess monomer can disrupt the cross-linking process, resulting in a weaker and more brittle material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
