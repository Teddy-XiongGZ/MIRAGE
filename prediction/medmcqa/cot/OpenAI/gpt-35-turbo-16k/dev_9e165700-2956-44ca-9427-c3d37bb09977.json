    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the access cavity shape in a mandibular first molar with 4 canals, we need to consider the anatomy of the tooth. Mandibular first molars typically have a trapezoidal access cavity shape. This is because the pulp chamber of the mandibular first molar is wider mesiodistally than buccolingually. Additionally, the access cavity shape should allow for adequate visualization and instrumentation of all four canals. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is A. Trapezoidal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
