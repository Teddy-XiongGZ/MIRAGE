    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Callus formation is the process by which new bone tissue forms at the site of a fracture. It is an important step in the healing process. To determine which of the options increases callus formation, we need to understand the factors that promote callus formation. Rigid immobilization refers to keeping the fractured bone stable and preventing movement. Movement at the fracture site can disrupt the formation of callus. Compression plating involves applying pressure to the fractured bone to promote stability and alignment. Intraosseous nailing is a surgical technique that involves inserting a metal rod into the bone to stabilize the fracture. Based on this information, the option that is most likely to increase callus formation is C. Compression plating, as it provides stability and alignment to the fractured bone, which promotes callus formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
