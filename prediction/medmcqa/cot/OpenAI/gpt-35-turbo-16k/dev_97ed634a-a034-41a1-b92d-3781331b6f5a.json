    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sinuses are air-filled spaces within the skull bones that are connected to the nasal cavity. They play a role in humidifying and filtering the air we breathe. The sinuses continue to grow and develop throughout childhood and into early adulthood. To determine which sinus grows till early adulthood, we need to consider the growth patterns of each sinus. A. Maxillary sinus: The maxillary sinus is the largest of the paranasal sinuses and is located in the cheekbones. It starts developing around birth and continues to grow until late adolescence. Therefore, it does not grow till early adulthood. B. Ethmoidal sinus: The ethmoidal sinuses are located between the eyes and behind the bridge of the nose. They consist of multiple small air cells. The ethmoidal sinuses start developing around birth and continue to grow until early adulthood. Therefore, they do grow till early adulthood. C. Frontal sinus: The frontal sinuses are located in the forehead, above the eyes. They start developing around age 7 and continue to grow until late adolescence. Therefore, they do not grow till early adulthood. D. Sphenoid sinus: The sphenoid sinus is located deep within the skull, behind the nose. It starts developing around age 3 and continues to grow until late adolescence. Therefore, it does not grow till early adulthood. Based on this information, the sinus that grows till early adulthood is the ethmoidal sinus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
