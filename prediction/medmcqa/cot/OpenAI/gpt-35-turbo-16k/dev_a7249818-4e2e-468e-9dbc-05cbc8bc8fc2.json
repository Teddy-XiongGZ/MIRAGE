    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell and are responsible for various metabolic processes. Let's analyze each option to determine which process does not take place in mitochondria. \\n\\nA. Beta-oxidation of fatty acids: This process occurs in the mitochondria, where fatty acids are broken down to produce energy. \\n\\nB. DNA synthesis: DNA synthesis occurs in the nucleus of the cell, not in the mitochondria. \\n\\nC. Fatty acid synthesis: Fatty acid synthesis primarily occurs in the cytoplasm, not in the mitochondria. \\n\\nD. Protein synthesis: Protein synthesis occurs in the ribosomes, which are located in the cytoplasm and on the endoplasmic reticulum, but not in the mitochondria. \\n\\nBased on this analysis, the process that does not take place in mitochondria is DNA synthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
