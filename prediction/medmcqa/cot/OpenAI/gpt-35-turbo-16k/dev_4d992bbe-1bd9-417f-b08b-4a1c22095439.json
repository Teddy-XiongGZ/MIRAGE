    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Mother to children's transmission refers to the passing of genetic traits from a mother to her children. This can occur through different patterns of inheritance. Codominance is a pattern of inheritance where both alleles of a gene are expressed equally. Autosomal dominant inheritance is a pattern where a single copy of a dominant allele is sufficient to cause the trait. Recessive inheritance is a pattern where two copies of a recessive allele are needed to express the trait. Mitochondrial inheritance is a pattern where the mitochondrial DNA is passed down from the mother to her children. Given that the question specifically mentions mother to children's transmission, the correct answer is D. Mitochondrial inheritance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
