    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The failure of topical administration of I% Pilocarpine to produce pupillary constriction in a patient with a large, dilated pupil suggests that there may be a pharmacological blockade. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist that acts on the muscarinic receptors in the iris sphincter muscle to cause pupillary constriction. If there is a blockade of these receptors, such as from the use of anticholinergic medications, it can prevent the pupillary constriction. Adie's tonic pupil is characterized by a dilated pupil that reacts poorly to light but constricts with near vision. Diabetic III nerve palsy is characterized by a dilated pupil that does not react to light due to damage to the oculomotor nerve. Uncal herniation can cause pupillary abnormalities, but it is not the most probable reason in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Pharmacological blockade\"}"
