    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glaucomatous optic neuropathy is a condition characterized by damage to the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain. To determine which cells are affected in this condition, we need to understand the anatomy of the optic nerve. The optic nerve is composed of axons of ganglion cells, which are the final output cells of the retina. These ganglion cells receive input from bipolar cells, which in turn receive input from photoreceptor cells (rods and cones). Amacrine cells, on the other hand, are interneurons within the retina that modulate the transmission of signals between bipolar and ganglion cells. Given this information, the cells primarily affected in glaucomatous optic neuropathy are ganglion cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
