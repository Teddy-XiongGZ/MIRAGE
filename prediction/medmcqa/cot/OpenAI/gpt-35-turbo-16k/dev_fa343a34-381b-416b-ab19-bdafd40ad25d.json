    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During post preparation in the distal canal of the mandibular first molar, the maximum chance of perforation is seen in the buccal surface.

Therefore, when preparing the post space in the distal canal, there is a higher risk of perforating through the buccal surface.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
