    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The treatment of choice for carcinoma of the larynx involving the left false cords, left arytenoid and the left aryepiglottic folds with bilateral mobile true cords is determined by the extent of the disease and the preservation of laryngeal function. In this case, since the true cords are still mobile, the goal would be to preserve laryngeal function as much as possible. Vertical hemilaryngectomy and horizontal partial hemilaryngectomy are both surgical options that aim to remove the affected areas while preserving laryngeal function. Total laryngectomy involves the complete removal of the larynx and would result in the loss of laryngeal function. Radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy is a non-surgical treatment option that may be considered in cases where surgery is not feasible or preferred. Based on the information provided, the most appropriate treatment of choice would be either vertical hemilaryngectomy or horizontal partial hemilaryngectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
