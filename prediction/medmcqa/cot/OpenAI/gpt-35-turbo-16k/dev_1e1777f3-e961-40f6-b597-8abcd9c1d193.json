    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To denote a continuous variable, we need a graphical representation that shows the distribution of values along a continuous scale. A simple bar graph is used to represent categorical data, where each bar represents a category. A pie diagram is used to represent parts of a whole. A multiple bar graph is used to compare multiple categories. A histogram, on the other hand, is used to represent the distribution of continuous data. It consists of bars that represent the frequency or count of data within specific intervals or bins along a continuous scale. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Histogram.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
