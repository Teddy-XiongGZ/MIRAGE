    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In case of a wider osteotomy planned, the goal is to create a larger space for the implant. Therefore, options that involve increasing the space or support for the implant would be appropriate. A. Press buccal and lingual plate: This option involves applying pressure to the buccal (outer) and lingual (inner) plates of the bone. This can help stabilize the implant and promote proper healing. It would be a suitable choice. B. Wider implant: This option involves using a wider implant to fill the larger space created by the osteotomy. This is also a suitable choice as it matches the goal of the procedure. C. Bone graft plus implant: This option involves using a bone graft to augment the bone and then placing an implant. This can help provide additional support and stability for the implant. It would be a suitable choice. D. Deep osteotomy: This option involves making a deeper cut into the bone. While it may create a larger space, it can also increase the risk of complications such as damage to nerves or blood vessels. Therefore, it would not be the ideal choice in this case. Based on the above reasoning, the answer choice is D. Deep osteotomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
