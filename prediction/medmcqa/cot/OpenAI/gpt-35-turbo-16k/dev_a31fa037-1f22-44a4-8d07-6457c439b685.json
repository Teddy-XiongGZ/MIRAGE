    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient in the ICCU has a positive blood culture for Gram +ve cocci. The fact that the cocci are catalase positive and coagulase negative narrows down the possibilities. Staphylococcus aureus is catalase positive and coagulase positive, so it can be ruled out. Streptococcus pyogenes is catalase negative, so it can also be ruled out. Enterococcus faecalis is catalase negative and coagulase negative, so it is a possibility. Staphylococcus epidermidis is catalase positive and coagulase negative, which matches the characteristics of the cocci in the blood culture. Therefore, the most likely etiological agent is Staphylococcus epidermidis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Staph. epidermidis\"}"
