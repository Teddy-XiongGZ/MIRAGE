    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient delivered a baby with normal expulsion of an intact placenta, which suggests that the placenta was initially delivered completely. However, after half an hour, she started bleeding per vaginally and was found to be hypotensive. On examination, a boggy mass is palpated per abdomen, indicating a uterine atony. The ultrasound showed retained placental tissues, which further supports the diagnosis of a uterine atony. Given these findings, the likely diagnosis is placenta accreta, which is a condition where the placenta is abnormally attached to the uterine wall and does not separate easily after delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C.
