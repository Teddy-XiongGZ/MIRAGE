    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 36-week primigravida who presented with a single seizure episode. The elevated blood pressure of 170/100 indicates hypertension, which could be a potential cause of the seizure. The immediate next step in management should focus on controlling the blood pressure to prevent further complications. Therefore, the most appropriate choice would be to administer Inj. mgso4 (intravenous magnesium sulfate) as it is the standard treatment for eclampsia, which is characterized by seizures in pregnancy associated with hypertension. Inj. Calcium gluconate is used to treat hyperkalemia and not indicated in this scenario. Inj. Phenetoin is an antiepileptic drug but not the first-line treatment for eclampsia. MRI brain is not necessary at this stage as the patient's symptoms and presentation are consistent with eclampsia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Inj. mgso4\"}"
