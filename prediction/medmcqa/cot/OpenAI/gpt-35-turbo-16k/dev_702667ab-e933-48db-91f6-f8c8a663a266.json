    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To have balance in a hand instrument, the blade edge should be positioned in a way that distributes the weight evenly. This means that the blade edge should be close to the axis of either the handle or the shank. The distance between the blade edge and the axis should be within a certain range. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Blade edge should be within 2 mm of the axis of handle - This option suggests that the blade edge should be close to the handle axis. B. Blade edge should be within 2 mm of the axis of shank - This option suggests that the blade edge should be close to the shank axis. C. Blade edge should be within 2.5 mm of the axis of handle - This option suggests a slightly larger distance between the blade edge and the handle axis compared to option A. D. Blade edge should be within 2.5 mm of the axis of shank - This option suggests a slightly larger distance between the blade edge and the shank axis compared to option B. Based on the principle of balance, the blade edge should be closer to the axis of the handle or the shank. Therefore, the correct answer is either option A or option B. To determine the exact answer, we need to consider the specific instrument and its design. Without further information, it is not possible to definitively choose between option A and option B. Therefore, the answer choice is: Uncertain (either A or B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"Uncertain (either A or B)\"}"
