    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The hormone that has a permissive role in puberty is GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone). GnRH is released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. These hormones then act on the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) to initiate the development of secondary sexual characteristics and the maturation of reproductive organs. Leptin is involved in regulating appetite and energy balance, but it does not directly influence puberty. Insulin is involved in glucose metabolism and has no direct role in puberty. GH (growth hormone) is involved in growth and development, but it does not have a permissive role in puberty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. GnRH\"}"
