    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cephalosporins are a class of antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of bacteria. However, not all cephalosporins are active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common and often drug-resistant bacteria. To determine which cephalosporin is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we need to consider the specific spectrum of activity of each drug. A. Cefoperazone: Cefoperazone is a third-generation cephalosporin that has good activity against many gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, it is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. B. Cefaclor: Cefaclor is a second-generation cephalosporin that has limited activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is not the best choice for treating infections caused by this bacteria. C. Ceftriaxone: Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that has good activity against many gram-negative bacteria. However, it is not very effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, it is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D. Cefotaxime: Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin that has good activity against many gram-negative bacteria. However, it is not very effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, it is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on the above information, the correct answer is A. Cefoperazone, as it is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
