    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Condensation shrinkage of porcelain during firing depends on several factors. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Rate of arriving at firing temperature: The rate at which the porcelain reaches the firing temperature may affect the overall shrinkage, but it is not directly related to condensation shrinkage.\\n\\nB. Uniformity of particle size: The uniformity of particle size can affect the packing density of the porcelain particles, which in turn can influence the condensation shrinkage.\\n\\nC. Shape and size of particle: The shape and size of the particles can also affect the packing density and the overall condensation shrinkage.\\n\\nD. Type of investment used: The type of investment used is not directly related to condensation shrinkage.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, options B and C seem to be the most relevant factors affecting condensation shrinkage of porcelain during firing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B/C\"}"
