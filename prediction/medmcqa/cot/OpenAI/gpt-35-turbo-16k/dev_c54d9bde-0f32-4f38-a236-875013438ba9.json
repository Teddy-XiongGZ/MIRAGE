    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Increased VDO (Vertical Dimension of Occlusion) refers to an increase in the distance between the upper and lower jaws when the teeth are in contact. This can occur due to various reasons such as dental restorations, tooth loss, or occlusal changes. Now, let's analyze the potential choices: \\n\\nA. Strained facial appearance: When there is an increase in VDO, the facial muscles may become strained as they try to adapt to the new jaw position. This can result in a strained or tense facial appearance.\\n\\nB. Trauma to underlying tissues: An increase in VDO can lead to trauma or injury to the underlying tissues such as the gums, tongue, or cheeks. This can occur due to excessive forces exerted on these tissues when the jaws come together.\\n\\nC. Clicking of teeth: Increased VDO can also cause the teeth to come into contact in an abnormal manner, leading to clicking or misalignment of the teeth.\\n\\nConsidering these explanations, the correct answer is D. All of the above, as all the mentioned choices can occur as a result of increased VDO.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
