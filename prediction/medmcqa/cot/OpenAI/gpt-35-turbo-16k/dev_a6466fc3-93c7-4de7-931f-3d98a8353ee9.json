    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To detect the translocation t(ll;22) in Ewing's sarcoma, we need a method that can specifically identify the chromosomal rearrangement. Let's evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. Conventional karyotyping: This method involves analyzing the chromosomes under a microscope to detect large-scale chromosomal abnormalities. However, it may not be sensitive enough to detect the specific translocation t(ll;22) in Ewing's sarcoma.\\n\\nB. Next generation sequencing: This method can sequence the entire genome or specific regions of interest. While it can detect genetic alterations, it may not be the most efficient method for specifically identifying the t(ll;22) translocation.\\n\\nC. FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization): This method uses fluorescent probes to detect specific DNA sequences. FISH is commonly used to detect chromosomal rearrangements, including the t(ll;22) translocation in Ewing's sarcoma. It is a reliable and specific method for this purpose.\\n\\nD. PCR (Polymerase chain reaction): PCR can amplify specific DNA sequences, allowing for their detection. However, it may not be the most suitable method for detecting the t(ll;22) translocation in Ewing's sarcoma.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the best method to detect the translocation t(ll;22) in Ewing's sarcoma would be C. FISH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
