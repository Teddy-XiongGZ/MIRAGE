    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The onset of puberty is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones then act on the gonads (testes in males, ovaries in females) to stimulate the production of sex hormones (testosterone in males, estrogen and progesterone in females). Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and has no direct role in the onset of puberty. Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells and plays a role in regulating appetite and energy balance, but it does not have a direct permissive action at the onset of puberty. Growth hormone is involved in growth and development, but it does not have a direct permissive action at the onset of puberty. Therefore, the correct answer is C. GnRH, as it is the hormone that initiates the release of LH and FSH, which are essential for the onset of puberty.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
