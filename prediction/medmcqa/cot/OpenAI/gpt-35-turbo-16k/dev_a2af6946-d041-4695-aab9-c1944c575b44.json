    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the repair mechanism used for genome editing is the homologous repair. This repair mechanism involves the use of a donor DNA template that is homologous to the target site. The Cas9 protein creates a double-strand break at the target site, and the donor DNA template is then used to repair the break by homologous recombination. This allows for precise editing of the genome by introducing specific changes at the target site.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
