    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gardner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple polyps in the colon and rectum. These polyps can become cancerous over time. Gardner syndrome is also associated with various extra-intestinal manifestations. To determine which option is not included in Gardner syndrome, we need to review the extra-intestinal manifestations associated with this condition. A. Osteomas: Osteomas are benign bone tumors that can occur in Gardner syndrome. Therefore, osteomas are included in Gardner syndrome. B. Epidermoid cysts: Epidermoid cysts are benign cysts that can develop in the skin or other parts of the body. While they are not commonly associated with Gardner syndrome, they can occur in some cases. Therefore, epidermoid cysts can be included in Gardner syndrome. C. Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor. While Gardner syndrome is associated with benign bone tumors (osteomas), it is not typically associated with malignant bone tumors like osteosarcoma. Therefore, osteosarcoma is not included in Gardner syndrome. D. Impacted permanent teeth: Impacted permanent teeth refer to teeth that are unable to fully emerge from the gums. While this is not a common manifestation of Gardner syndrome, it can occur in some cases. Therefore, impacted permanent teeth can be included in Gardner syndrome. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is C. Osteosarcoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
