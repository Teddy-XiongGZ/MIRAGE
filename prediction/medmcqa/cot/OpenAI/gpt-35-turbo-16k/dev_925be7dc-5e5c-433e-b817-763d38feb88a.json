    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are a type of immune cell that play a crucial role in initiating and regulating immune responses. They capture, process, and present antigens to T cells, which then activate the immune response. M-cells are specialized cells found in the mucosal lining of the intestines and respiratory tract that transport antigens from the lumen to the underlying immune cells. Macrophages are a type of phagocytic cell that engulf and digest pathogens and present antigens to T cells. Langerhans cells are a specialized type of dendritic cell found in the skin and mucosal surfaces that capture and present antigens to T cells. Thymocytes, on the other hand, are immature T cells that are undergoing maturation in the thymus. They are not antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Thymocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
