    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Glutamic acid is a negatively charged amino acid, while valine is a neutral amino acid. The substitution of glutamic acid with valine in sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) leads to a change in the overall charge of the protein. As a result, the mobility of HbS on gel electrophoresis will be different compared to normal hemoglobin. Since HbS has a reduced negative charge compared to normal hemoglobin, it will have a decreased mobility on gel electrophoresis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Decreased\"}"
