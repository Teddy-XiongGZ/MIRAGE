    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which muscle helps in depressing the mandible, we need to understand the anatomy and function of the muscles involved. The mandible is the lower jaw bone, and depression refers to the downward movement of the mandible. The muscles responsible for this movement are primarily the muscles of mastication. The temporalis muscle is located on the side of the head and is responsible for elevating the mandible. The masseter muscle is also located on the side of the head and is responsible for elevating the mandible. The lateral pterygoid muscle is located in the lateral aspect of the skull and is responsible for protrusion and lateral movement of the mandible. The medial pterygoid muscle is located in the medial aspect of the skull and is responsible for elevating the mandible. Based on this information, the muscle that helps in depressing the mandible is the lateral pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
