Bisphosphonates should be taken with food to enhance absorption and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.\\n\\nC. Stop if features of gastritis develop: While gastrointestinal side effects can occur with bisphosphonate use, it is not necessary to stop the medication if features of gastritis develop. Instead, patients should be advised to report any persistent or severe gastrointestinal symptoms to their healthcare provider.\\n\\nD.
