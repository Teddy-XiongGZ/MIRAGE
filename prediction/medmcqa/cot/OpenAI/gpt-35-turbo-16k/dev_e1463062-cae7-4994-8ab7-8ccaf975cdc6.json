    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which antibiotic is effective against pseudomonas and indole +ve proteus, we need to consider the spectrum of activity of each antibiotic. \\n\\nA. Methicillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin and is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. It is not effective against pseudomonas or indole +ve proteus. \\n\\nB. Carbenicillin is a broad-spectrum penicillin and is effective against many gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas. However, it is not effective against indole +ve proteus. \\n\\nC. Lincomycin is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria and is not effective against pseudomonas or indole +ve proteus. \\n\\nD. Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin and is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. It is not effective against pseudomonas or indole +ve proteus. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is B. Carbenicillin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
