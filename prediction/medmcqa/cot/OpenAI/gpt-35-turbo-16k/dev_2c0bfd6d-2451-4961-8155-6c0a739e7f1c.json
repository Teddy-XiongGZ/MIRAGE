    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Let's go through each statement one by one and determine if it is true or false. \\n\\nA. The enzyme that attaches an amino acid to a tRNA is aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. This statement is true. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is responsible for attaching the correct amino acid to the corresponding tRNA molecule. \\n\\nB. Although composed of a single strand of RNA, each molecule contains several short, double-helical regions. This statement is true. tRNA molecules have a cloverleaf-like structure with several short double-helical regions. \\n\\nC. The amino acid attachment is always to the 3' end of the molecule. This statement is true. The amino acid is attached to the 3' end of the tRNA molecule. \\n\\nD. There is at least one tRNA for each of the 20 amino acids. This statement is false. There are more than 20 amino acids, but there are not necessarily tRNA molecules for each of them. Therefore, the false statement is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
