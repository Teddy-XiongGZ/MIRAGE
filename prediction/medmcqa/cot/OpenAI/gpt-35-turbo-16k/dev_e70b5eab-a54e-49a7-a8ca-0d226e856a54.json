    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the rate of caries progression, we need to compare the Lactobacillus count after the caries activity test to a reference range. Without a reference range, it is difficult to determine the exact rate of caries progression. However, we can make an educated guess based on the given count. A count of 10,500 CFU indicates a relatively high level of Lactobacillus, which suggests an active caries process. Based on this information, it is likely that the rate of caries progression is at least moderate or severe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Moderate\"}"
