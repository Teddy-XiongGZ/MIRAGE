    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In cases of open apex, the MTA barrier is used to seal the apex of the tooth and prevent any leakage. The purpose of the MTA barrier is to create a tight seal and promote healing. The thickness of the MTA barrier should be sufficient to provide an effective seal. In general, the MTA barrier in open apex cases is made up to a certain thickness. To determine the correct thickness, it is important to consider the length of the canal. The MTA barrier should extend to a specific distance from the apex, which is typically recommended to be around 3mm. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 3mm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
