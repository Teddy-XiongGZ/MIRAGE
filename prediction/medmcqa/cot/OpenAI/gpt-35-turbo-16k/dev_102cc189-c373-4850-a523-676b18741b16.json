    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if a case is a high angle case, we need to consider various measurements. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. FMIA > 65: FMIA stands for Frankfort Mandibular Incisor Angle, which measures the angle between the mandibular incisor and the Frankfort horizontal plane. However, this measurement alone does not determine if a case is high angle or not.\\n\\nB. IMP > 100: IMP stands for Intermaxillary Plane Angle, which measures the angle between the maxillary and mandibular planes. Again, this measurement alone does not determine if a case is high angle or not.\\n\\nC. FMP > 35\u00b0: FMP stands for Frankfort Mandibular Plane Angle, which measures the angle between the Frankfort horizontal plane and the mandibular plane. This measurement is commonly used to assess the vertical growth pattern. If the FMP is greater than 35\u00b0, it indicates a high angle case.\\n\\nD. SNA > 4\u00b0: SNA stands for Sella-Nasion-A point angle, which measures the relationship between the maxilla and the cranial base. However, this measurement alone does not determine if a case is high angle or not.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. FMP > 35\u00b0.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
