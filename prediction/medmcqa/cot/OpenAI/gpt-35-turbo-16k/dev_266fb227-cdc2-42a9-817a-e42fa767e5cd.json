    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anaphylactic shock is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The first-line therapy for anaphylactic shock is epinephrine. Epinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor and bronchodilator that helps to reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis. It is typically administered intramuscularly (IM) in a dose of 0.5 ml of 1:1000 concentration. Adenosine is not indicated in the treatment of anaphylactic shock. Atropine is used for bradycardia, not anaphylactic shock. Epinephrine can also be administered intravenously (IV) in a dose of 1 ml of 1:10000 concentration, but IM administration is preferred as it has a more rapid onset of action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
