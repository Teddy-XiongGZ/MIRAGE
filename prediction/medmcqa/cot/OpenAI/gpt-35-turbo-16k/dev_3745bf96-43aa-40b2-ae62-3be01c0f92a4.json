    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with secondary amenorrhea, which means she had regular menstrual cycles in the past but has now stopped menstruating. The most common causes of secondary amenorrhea include pregnancy, ovarian failure, pituitary failure, and uterine abnormalities. In this case, the patient had a spontaneous abortion, which suggests the possibility of ongoing pregnancy. However, the FSH level of 6 IU/mL is within the normal range, which makes ovarian failure less likely. Pituitary failure would typically result in elevated FSH levels. Uterine synechiae, which refers to adhesions or scar tissue in the uterus, is not a common cause of secondary amenorrhea. Therefore, the most probable cause of amenorrhea in this case is ongoing pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Ongoing pregnancy\"}"
