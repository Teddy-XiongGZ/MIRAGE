    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Sodium nitroprusside is metabolized to form an active metabolite. To determine the activation of this active metabolite, we need to consider its mechanism of action. Sodium nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that works by releasing nitric oxide (NO) in the body. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which then catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP acts as a second messenger and leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Therefore, the active metabolite of sodium nitroprusside activates guanylate cyclase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
