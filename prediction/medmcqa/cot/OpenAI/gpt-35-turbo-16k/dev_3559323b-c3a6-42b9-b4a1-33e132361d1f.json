    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During a parotidectomy, the parotid gland is removed, which can potentially lead to nerve injury. The facial nerve is the main nerve at risk during this procedure, as it runs through the parotid gland. The facial nerve innervates the muscles of facial expression and also provides sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. However, the numbness on shaving after parotidectomy is not typically due to facial nerve injury. The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3), provides sensory innervation to the skin of the external ear and the temporal region. The greater auricular nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus, provides sensory innervation to the skin over the parotid gland and the angle of the mandible. The occipital nerve provides sensory innervation to the posterior scalp. Given the location of the numbness on shaving after parotidectomy, the most likely nerve injury is the greater auricular nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
