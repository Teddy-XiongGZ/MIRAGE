    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is commonly administered to mothers at risk of premature delivery to promote fetal lung maturity. It works by stimulating the production of surfactant in the fetal lungs, which helps to prevent respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborn. Additionally, betamethasone has been shown to decrease the risk of other complications associated with prematurity, such as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and neonatal morbidity. However, betamethasone does not have a direct effect on preventing hyperbilirubinemia, which is the buildup of bilirubin in the blood that can lead to jaundice in newborns. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Prevents hyperbilirubinemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
