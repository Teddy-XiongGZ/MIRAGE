    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify a specific DNA sequence. It involves several components. Let's go through each option to determine which one is not used in PCR.\\n\\nA. DNA Polymerase: DNA polymerase is a key enzyme used in PCR. It synthesizes new DNA strands by adding nucleotides to the growing DNA chain. Therefore, DNA polymerase is used in PCR.\\n\\nB. Taq polymerase: Taq polymerase is a type of DNA polymerase that is commonly used in PCR. It is derived from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus and is heat-stable, making it suitable for the high-temperature cycling required in PCR. Therefore, Taq polymerase is used in PCR.\\n\\nC. Dideoxyribonucleotides: Dideoxyribonucleotides (ddNTPs) are used in DNA sequencing methods such as the Sanger sequencing method. They are not typically used in PCR, which is primarily used for DNA amplification rather than sequencing. Therefore, dideoxyribonucleotides are not used in PCR.\\n\\nD. DNA template: The DNA template is the starting material in PCR. It contains the target DNA sequence that needs to be amplified. Therefore, the DNA template is used in PCR.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Dideoxyribonucleotides.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
