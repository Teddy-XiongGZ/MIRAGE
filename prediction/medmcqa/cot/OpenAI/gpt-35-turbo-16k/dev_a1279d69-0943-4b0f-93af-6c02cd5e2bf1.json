    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The buccinator muscle is a facial muscle that forms the lateral wall of the oral cavity. It is pierced by several structures. Let's go through each option to determine which one does not pierce the buccinator muscle:\\n\\nA. Labial branch of facial nerve: The labial branch of the facial nerve does not pierce the buccinator muscle. It supplies the muscles of the upper lip and does not pass through the buccinator.\\n\\nB. Buccal branch of mandibular nerve: The buccal branch of the mandibular nerve does pierce the buccinator muscle. It provides sensory innervation to the buccal mucosa.\\n\\nC. Parotid duct: The parotid duct, also known as Stensen's duct, passes through the buccinator muscle. It carries saliva from the parotid gland to the oral cavity.\\n\\nD. Molar mucous glands: The molar mucous glands are located in the buccal mucosa and do not pierce the buccinator muscle.\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is D. Molar mucous glands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
