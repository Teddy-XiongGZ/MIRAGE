    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This study involves recording the sale of anti-asthma drugs and measuring the number of deaths because of asthma over a period of 15 years. The study does not involve any intervention or manipulation of variables, so it is not an experimental study. Psephology is the study of elections and voting behavior, which is not relevant to this scenario. Case reference studies typically involve comparing cases with a specific outcome to a reference group without the outcome, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most appropriate type of study for this scenario is an ecological study, where data is collected at the population level rather than at the individual level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
