    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The temporo-mandibular ligament is a ligament that helps stabilize the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). To determine where it is attached, we need to understand the anatomy of the TMJ. The TMJ is a joint that connects the mandible (lower jaw) to the temporal bone of the skull. It consists of the mandibular condyle, which is the rounded end of the mandible, and the articular fossa of the temporal bone. The ligaments of the TMJ help to hold the joint together and provide stability. Based on this information, the correct answer is C. Mandibular condyle, as the temporo-mandibular ligament is attached to the mandibular condyle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
