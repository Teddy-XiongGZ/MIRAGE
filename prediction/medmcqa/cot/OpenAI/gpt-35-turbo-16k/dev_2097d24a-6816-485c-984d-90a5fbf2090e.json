    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"At 3 months of age, infants are typically exclusively breastfed or formula-fed. Introducing cereals at this age can lead to several problems. First, the infant's digestive system may not be ready to handle solid foods, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal infection (such as diarrhea). Second, introducing cereals too early can interfere with the infant's oro-motor development, as they may not have developed the necessary skills to swallow solid foods.

Contaminated food leading to reflux is not a common problem associated with introducing cereals to a 3-month-old child.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
