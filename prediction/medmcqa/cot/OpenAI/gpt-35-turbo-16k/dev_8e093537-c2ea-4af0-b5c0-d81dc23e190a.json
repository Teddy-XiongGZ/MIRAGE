    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Km value is a measure of the substrate concentration at half maximal velocity. It represents the concentration of substrate at which the enzyme is working at half of its maximum velocity. This value is used to determine the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The substrate concentration at half maximal velocity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
