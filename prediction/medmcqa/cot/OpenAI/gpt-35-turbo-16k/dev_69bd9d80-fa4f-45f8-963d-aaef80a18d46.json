    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Both ventouse and forceps are instruments used in assisted vaginal delivery. The question asks for complications that are more common in ventouse assisted delivery than forceps. To determine the answer, we need to compare the complications associated with each method. Let's go through each option:\\n\\nA. Subgaleal hemorrhage: This is a potential complication of both ventouse and forceps delivery. It occurs when there is bleeding between the scalp and the skull. It is not specific to either method.\\n\\nB. Cephalhematoma: This is also a potential complication of both ventouse and forceps delivery. It refers to the collection of blood between the skull and the periosteum. It is not specific to either method.\\n\\nC. Intracranial hemorrhage: This is a serious complication that can occur with both ventouse and forceps delivery. It refers to bleeding within the skull. It is not specific to either method.\\n\\nD. Transient lateral rectus palsy: This is a potential complication of forceps delivery, but it is not associated with ventouse delivery. Therefore, this is the correct answer choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
