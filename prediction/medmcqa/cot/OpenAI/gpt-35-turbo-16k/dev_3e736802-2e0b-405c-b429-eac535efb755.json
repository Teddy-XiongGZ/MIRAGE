    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Anti D is required in cases where there is a risk of Rh(D) sensitization in Rh(D) negative individuals. Rh(D) sensitization can occur when an Rh(D) negative individual is exposed to Rh(D) positive blood. The exposure can happen during pregnancy or childbirth, or during certain medical procedures. In this case, we need to determine which option does not pose a risk of Rh(D) sensitization. A. Abortion at 63 days: During an abortion, there is a risk of fetal blood mixing with the mother's blood, which can lead to Rh(D) sensitization. Therefore, Anti D is required in this case. B. Manual removal of placenta: During the manual removal of placenta, there is a risk of fetal blood mixing with the mother's blood, which can lead to Rh(D) sensitization. Therefore, Anti D is required in this case. C. Amniocentesis at 16 weeks: Amniocentesis is a procedure where a sample of amniotic fluid is taken for testing. This procedure does not involve direct contact between the mother's blood and the fetal blood, so there is no risk of Rh(D) sensitization. Therefore, Anti D is not required in this case. D. Intrauterine transfusion at 28 weeks: Intrauterine transfusion involves the direct transfer of blood into the fetus's umbilical vein. This procedure carries a risk of fetal blood mixing with the mother's blood, which can lead to Rh(D) sensitization. Therefore, Anti D is required in this case. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Amniocentesis at 16 weeks, as it does not require Anti D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
