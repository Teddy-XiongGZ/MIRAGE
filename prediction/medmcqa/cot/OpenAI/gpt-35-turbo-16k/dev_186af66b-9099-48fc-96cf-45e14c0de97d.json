    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Enlarged adenoids can affect the maxillary growth in several ways. One possible effect is the narrowing of the maxilla. Enlarged adenoids can obstruct the nasal airway, leading to mouth breathing. Mouth breathing can result in a high arched palate and a narrow maxilla. Another possible effect is the palatal plane tipping upwards at the posterior nasal spine (PNS). This can occur due to the pressure exerted by the enlarged adenoids. The descent of the palate is not typically associated with enlarged adenoids. Therefore, the correct answer is either A. Narrowing of maxilla or C. Palatal plane tipped upwards at PNS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
