    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The fetal adrenals are responsible for producing hormones during fetal development. To determine which hormone is predominantly released by the fetal adrenals, we need to consider the function of each hormone listed. \\n\\nA. Oestrogen: Oestrogen is primarily produced by the ovaries in females and plays a role in the development of secondary sexual characteristics. It is not predominantly released by the fetal adrenals. \\n\\nB. Testosterone: Testosterone is primarily produced by the testes in males and is responsible for the development of male sexual characteristics. It is not predominantly released by the fetal adrenals. \\n\\nC. Aldosterone: Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands and plays a role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance. While the fetal adrenals do produce aldosterone, it is not the predominant hormone released. \\n\\nD. Coisone: Coisone is not a known hormone. \\n\\nBased on the options provided, the correct answer is C. Aldosterone, as it is the only hormone listed that is produced by the adrenal glands and could potentially be released by the fetal adrenals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
