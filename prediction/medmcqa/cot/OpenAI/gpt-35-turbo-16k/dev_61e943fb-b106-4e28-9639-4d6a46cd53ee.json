    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insufficient closure of the flasks during packing of denture base resin can result in: 1. Poor colour stability: Insufficient closure of the flasks is unlikely to directly affect the color stability of the denture base resin. 2. Less polymerization shrinkage: Insufficient closure of the flasks can lead to inadequate pressure during polymerization, resulting in incomplete polymerization and therefore more polymerization shrinkage. 3. Increase in vertical dimension: Insufficient closure of the flasks can cause the resin to expand during polymerization, leading to an increase in the vertical dimension of the denture base. 4. Decrease in vertical dimension: Insufficient closure of the flasks is unlikely to cause a decrease in the vertical dimension of the denture base.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
