    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When bacteria enter the body, the immune system responds by trying to eliminate them. One of the ways the immune system can eliminate bacteria is through phagocytosis, which is the process of engulfing and destroying foreign particles. Neutrophilic leukocytes, also known as neutrophils, are the most abundant type of white blood cells and are highly effective at phagocytosis. They are often the first responders to bacterial infections. Large granular lymphocytes and small lymphocytes are types of white blood cells, but they are not as specialized in phagocytosis as neutrophils. Killer cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells, are a type of lymphocyte that primarily target and kill infected cells, rather than directly engulfing bacteria. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Neutrophilic leukocytes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
