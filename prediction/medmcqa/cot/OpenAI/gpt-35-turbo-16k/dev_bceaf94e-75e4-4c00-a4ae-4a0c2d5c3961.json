    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In case of buccolingual wide proximal box, the goal is to create a tight contact between the restoration and the adjacent tooth. Wedging is a technique used to create separation between the teeth and create space for the restoration. A. Wedge wedging involves placing a single wedge between the teeth. This method may not provide enough separation in the case of a wide proximal box. B. Double wedging involves placing two wedges, one on each side of the proximal box. This can provide more separation and better adaptation of the restoration. C. Piggy back wedging involves placing a smaller wedge on top of a larger wedge. This method can be useful in cases where a single wedge is not enough, but it may not provide as much separation as double wedging. D. None of the above options may be suitable if the proximal box is wide and requires more separation than a single wedge can provide. Based on the above reasoning, the most appropriate wedging method for a buccolingual wide proximal box would be B. Double wedging.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
