    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acid dissolution refers to the process of breaking down or dissolving a material using acid. In the context of the question, we are looking for the part of the rod that is most commonly affected by acid dissolution. To determine the answer, we need to consider the properties of the rod and how acid interacts with it. Acid dissolution is typically influenced by factors such as the composition and structure of the material. In the case of a rod, the periphery of the head, head region, and rod tails are the potential areas that could be affected by acid dissolution. Considering the typical structure of a rod, the head region is usually made of a different material compared to the rod tails. The head region is often made of a denser and harder material, such as metal, while the rod tails are usually made of a softer material, such as plastic or rubber. Given this information, it is more likely that acid dissolution would occur in the rod tails rather than the periphery of the head or the head region. The softer material of the rod tails is more susceptible to acid dissolution compared to the harder material of the head region. Therefore, the answer is C. Rod tails.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
