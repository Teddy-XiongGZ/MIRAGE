    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Resorbable Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) materials are used to promote tissue regeneration and are eventually absorbed by the body. To determine which material is not resorbable, we need to evaluate each option. \\n\\nA. Poly lactic acid: Poly lactic acid is a biodegradable polymer that is resorbable and commonly used in GTR. \\n\\nB. Poly galactic acid: Poly galactic acid is not a commonly used material in GTR. \\n\\nC. Polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, and trimethylene carbonate: These are all resorbable materials that are commonly used in GTR. \\n\\nD. PTFE: PTFE, or polytetrafluoroethylene, is a non-resorbable material and is not used in GTR. \\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer is D. PTFE.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
