    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gluconeogenesis is the process of synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids and glycerol. It is the reverse pathway of glycolysis. In gluconeogenesis, several enzymes are involved in catalyzing the different steps of the pathway. The enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis include pyruvate carboxylase, PEP carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase. These enzymes are responsible for converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate, oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, respectively. However, pyruvate kinase is not involved in gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate in the glycolysis pathway. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Pyruvate kinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
