    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Central wrapping refers to the wrapping of sensory nerve endings around muscle fibers. The Golgi tendon is not involved in central wrapping, as it is responsible for detecting tension in tendons. Type 2 fibers are muscle fibers that are involved in muscle contraction, but they are not directly involved in central wrapping. Flower spray endings are sensory nerve endings found in muscle spindles, which are involved in detecting muscle length and changes in muscle length. Annulospiral endings, on the other hand, are sensory nerve endings that are responsible for central wrapping. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Annulospiral ending.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
