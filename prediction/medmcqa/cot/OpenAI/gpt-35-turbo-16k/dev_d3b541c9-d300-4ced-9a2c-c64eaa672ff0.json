    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 6-month-old boy presenting with recurrent vomiting and polyuria. The investigations show elevated blood calcium levels (12.8 mg/dL), reduced urinary calcium excretion, and bilateral nephrocalcinosis on ultrasound. The pH and bicarbonate levels are within normal range, ruling out metabolic acidosis. The PTH level is elevated (140 pg/ml) which indicates primary hyperparathyroidism. The most likely diagnosis in this case is parathyroid adenoma, as it is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism in children.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
