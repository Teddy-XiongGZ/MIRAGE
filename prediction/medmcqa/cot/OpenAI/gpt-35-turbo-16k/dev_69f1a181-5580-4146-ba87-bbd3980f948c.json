    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Epistaxis refers to nosebleeds. In order to control epistaxis, vessels in the nasal cavity may need to be ligated. The maxillary artery and the anterior ethmoidal artery are two common vessels that may be ligated to control epistaxis. The internal carotid artery is not typically ligated in case of epistaxis control, as it is a major blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. The external carotid artery, on the other hand, is often ligated to control epistaxis. Therefore, the vessel that is not ligated in case of epistaxis control is the internal carotid artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
