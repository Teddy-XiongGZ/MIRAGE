    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To achieve slow tooth separation, we need a method that applies continuous and gentle force on the teeth. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Use of 26 gauge spring wire around proximal contacts: This option involves using a spring wire that applies a constant force on the teeth, promoting slow tooth separation.\\n\\nB. Use of soft brass wire around contacts: Soft brass wire may not provide enough force to achieve slow tooth separation.\\n\\nC. Use of oversized resin: Oversized resin may not provide the necessary force for slow tooth separation.\\n\\nD. All of the above: Option D includes both the use of 26 gauge spring wire and soft brass wire, which may not be effective together. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Use of 26 gauge spring wire around proximal contacts.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
