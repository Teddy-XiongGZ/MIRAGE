    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Loss of lamina dura radiographically and high sound on percussion are indicative of external resorption. External resorption occurs when the cells from the periodontal ligament or the surrounding bone start to resorb the root surface of the replanted tooth. This can lead to the loss of lamina dura and a high sound on percussion. Internal resorption refers to resorption occurring within the pulp chamber or root canal space. Replacement resorption refers to the replacement of the root structure by bone. Cervical resorption refers to resorption occurring at the cervical (neck) region of the tooth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. External resorption\"}"
