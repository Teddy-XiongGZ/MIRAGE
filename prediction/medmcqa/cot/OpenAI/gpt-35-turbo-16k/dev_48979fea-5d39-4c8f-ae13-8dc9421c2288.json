    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When transfusing red blood cells (RBCs), it is important to consider the needle size and timing. The needle size is important to ensure that the RBCs can flow smoothly through the needle without causing any damage or clotting. The timing is important to ensure that the RBCs are transfused in a timely manner to provide the necessary oxygen-carrying capacity to the patient. Option A states that RBCs should be transfused with an 18-20 G needle within 4 hours of receiving at the patient's side. Option B is the same as option A, so we can eliminate it. Option C states that RBCs should be transfused with a 20-22 G needle within 4 hours of issue from the blood bank. This option does not mention the patient's side, so it is not the correct choice. Option D states that RBCs should be transfused with a 20-22 G needle within 4 hours of receiving at the patient's side. This option includes the correct needle size and timing, so it is the most appropriate choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
