    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In the citric acid cycle, substrate level phosphorylation occurs during the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase. During this reaction, a high-energy phosphate group is transferred from succinyl-CoA to a nucleotide diphosphate, resulting in the formation of a high-energy phosphate compound. The nucleotide diphosphate that accepts the phosphate group in this reaction is guanosine diphosphate (GDP), which is then converted to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Therefore, the correct answer is D. GTP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
