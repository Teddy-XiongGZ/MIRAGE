    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a pregnant lady with persistent late, variable deceleration, the priority is to ensure adequate oxygenation and perfusion to the fetus. The supine position should be avoided as it can compress the inferior vena cava and reduce venous return, leading to decreased cardiac output and oxygenation. Therefore, the supine position is not done in this situation. O2 inhalation is important to improve oxygenation. IV fluid administration is necessary to maintain hydration and optimize maternal blood volume. Subcutaneous terbutaline is not directly related to the management of fetal distress and is not typically used in this situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
