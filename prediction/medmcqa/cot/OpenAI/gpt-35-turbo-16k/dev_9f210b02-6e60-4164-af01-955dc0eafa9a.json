    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Dentinal tubules are tiny channels that extend from the pulp to the outer surface of the dentin. They are responsible for transmitting sensations such as temperature and pain. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Inner pulpal layer contains more dentinal tubules than outer dentin layer: This statement is true. The inner pulpal layer of dentin contains more dentinal tubules compared to the outer dentin layer.\\n\\nB. The diameter of dentin tubules ranges from 5 to 7\u03bcm: This statement is true. The diameter of dentin tubules typically ranges from 1 to 3\u03bcm, not 5 to 7\u03bcm.\\n\\nC. The diameter of dentinal tubule is more at pulpal layer than outer layer: This statement is true. The diameter of dentinal tubules is larger at the pulpal layer compared to the outer layer.\\n\\nD. The bonding is more difficult on the inner Layer of dentin compared to outer surface: This statement is false. The bonding is actually easier on the inner layer of dentin compared to the outer surface due to the presence of more dentinal tubules for adhesive penetration.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
