    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The heart muscle, also known as cardiac muscle, is a specialized type of muscle tissue found only in the heart. It has unique characteristics that allow it to perform its function of pumping blood throughout the body. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Act as syncitium: The heart muscle acts as a syncitium, which means that the individual muscle cells are connected by intercalated discs, allowing electrical impulses to spread rapidly and coordinate the contraction of the entire heart. This statement is true.\\n\\nB. Has multiple nuclei: Unlike skeletal muscle cells, which have multiple nuclei, cardiac muscle cells typically have a single nucleus. This statement is false.\\n\\nC. Has gap junctions: Gap junctions are specialized protein channels that allow direct communication between adjacent cells. In the heart muscle, gap junctions play a crucial role in transmitting electrical signals between cells, ensuring coordinated contraction. This statement is true.\\n\\nD. Has branching: Cardiac muscle cells are branched, allowing them to form a network that facilitates the spread of electrical impulses and contraction throughout the heart. This statement is true.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation, the correct answer is B. Has multiple nuclei, as cardiac muscle cells typically have a single nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
