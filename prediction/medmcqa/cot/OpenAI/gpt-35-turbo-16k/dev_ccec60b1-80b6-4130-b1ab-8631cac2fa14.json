    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"FNAC stands for Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology, which is a procedure used to obtain cells from a suspicious lump or mass in the body. It is commonly used to diagnose thyroid nodules. However, FNAC has limitations and cannot definitively diagnose certain types of thyroid cancer. To determine which type of thyroid cancer cannot be diagnosed by FNAC, we need to consider the characteristics of each type. Papillary carcinoma of thyroid, follicular carcinoma of thyroid, anaplastic carcinoma of thyroid, and medullary carcinoma of thyroid are the four main types of thyroid cancer. Among these, papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma are the most common types and can usually be diagnosed by FNAC. Anaplastic carcinoma is a rare and aggressive type of thyroid cancer that is often diagnosed based on clinical and radiological findings rather than FNAC. Medullary carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells and is also typically diagnosed based on clinical and radiological findings rather than FNAC. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Anaplastic carcinoma of thyroid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
