    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fanconi syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by dysfunction of the proximal renal tubules, leading to impaired reabsorption of various substances including glucose, amino acids, phosphate, and bicarbonate. Nephrocalcinosis refers to the deposition of calcium salts in the renal parenchyma. Dent disease is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and progressive renal failure. The correct answer can be determined by understanding the features of Dent disease. Hypercalciuria and proteinuria are both features of Dent disease, so they are not the correct answer. Similar presentation in the father is a characteristic of X-linked recessive disorders, so it is likely to be true in Dent disease. Rickets, on the other hand, is not typically associated with Dent disease. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Rickets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
