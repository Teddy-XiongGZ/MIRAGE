    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The tensor veli palatini is a muscle located in the soft palate. To determine its nerve supply, we need to consider the innervation of the soft palate. The soft palate is primarily innervated by the pharyngeal plexus, which is formed by branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and vagus nerve (CN X). The tensor veli palatini muscle is specifically supplied by the nerve fibers from the pharyngeal plexus. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Pharyngeal plexus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
