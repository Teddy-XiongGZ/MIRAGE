    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Step 1: Community acquired pneumonia is commonly caused by gram-positive organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Step 2: Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins or cephalosporins, are effective against gram-positive organisms. Step 3: Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has activity against atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Step 4: Anaerobic organisms are not typically a major cause of community acquired pneumonia. Step 5: Therefore, the combination therapy of beta-lactams and azithromycin would cover gram-positive organisms and atypical pathogens, but not anaerobes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Asseion is true but reason is false.\"}"
