    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Congenital anodontia refers to the complete absence of teeth at birth. To determine the inheritance pattern of true congenital anodontia, we can consider the known patterns of inheritance for dental anomalies. A. X linked dominant: This inheritance pattern would mean that the condition is passed down from an affected parent to both male and female offspring. However, true congenital anodontia is not typically inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. B. X linked recessive: This inheritance pattern would mean that the condition is passed down from carrier females to affected males. Again, true congenital anodontia is not typically inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. C. Autosomal dominant: This inheritance pattern would mean that the condition is passed down from an affected parent to both male and female offspring. Autosomal dominant inheritance is the most common pattern for true congenital anodontia. D. Polygenic: Polygenic inheritance refers to the combined effect of multiple genes on a trait. While genetic factors may contribute to the development of dental anomalies, true congenital anodontia is not primarily caused by polygenic inheritance. Based on the above information, the most likely inheritance pattern for true congenital anodontia is C. Autosomal dominant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
