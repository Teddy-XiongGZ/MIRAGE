    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Splinting of cervical root fracture is done to immobilize the fractured bone and promote healing. The duration of splinting depends on the severity of the fracture and the healing process. Generally, splinting is done for a period of time that allows the fracture to heal properly. In the case of cervical root fractures, the duration of splinting is usually shorter compared to other fractures. It is important to provide support and stability to the fractured bone, but prolonged immobilization can lead to muscle atrophy and joint stiffness. Considering this, the most appropriate duration for splinting of cervical root fracture would be a relatively shorter period of time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. 14 days\"}"
