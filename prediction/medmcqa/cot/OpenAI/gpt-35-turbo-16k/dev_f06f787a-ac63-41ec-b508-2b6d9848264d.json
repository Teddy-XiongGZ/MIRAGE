    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acute phase reactants are proteins that are produced by the liver in response to inflammation or infection. They can be either positive or negative acute phase reactants. Positive acute phase reactants increase in concentration during inflammation, while negative acute phase reactants decrease in concentration. To determine which of the options is a negative acute phase reactant, we need to identify which one decreases in concentration during inflammation. Ferritin is a positive acute phase reactant, as its concentration increases during inflammation. Haptoglobin is also a positive acute phase reactant. Albumin is a negative acute phase reactant, as its concentration decreases during inflammation. C-reactive protein is a positive acute phase reactant. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Albumin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
