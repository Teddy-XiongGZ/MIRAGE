    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which change in insulin structure would result in the least change in function, we need to consider the role and importance of each region or modification. A. Interchange of A1 & A4: The A chain of insulin is responsible for receptor binding, and the specific arrangement of amino acids in this region is crucial for its function. Interchanging A1 and A4 could potentially disrupt the binding ability of insulin to its receptor, leading to a significant change in function. B. Interchange of B29 and B30: The B chain of insulin is involved in the formation of disulfide linkages and plays a role in stabilizing the insulin structure. Interchanging B29 and B30 may not have a significant impact on the overall function of insulin, as long as the disulfide linkages are maintained. C. Interchange of A5 & A6: The A chain of insulin also contains important amino acids involved in receptor binding. Interchanging A5 and A6 could potentially affect the binding ability of insulin to its receptor, leading to a change in function. D. Breaking disulfide linkages: Disulfide linkages are crucial for maintaining the three-dimensional structure of insulin. Breaking these linkages would result in a significant change in the structure and function of insulin. Based on this analysis, the change that would result in the least change in the function of insulin is B. Interchange of B29 and B30, as long as the disulfide linkages are maintained.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
