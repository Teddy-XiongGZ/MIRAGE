    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The occulomotor nerve is the third cranial nerve and is responsible for the movement of the eye and the constriction of the pupil. It carries both motor and parasympathetic fibers. The parasympathetic fibers of the occulomotor nerve innervate the sphincter pupillae muscle, which causes constriction of the pupil. Therefore, options A and B are true. The occulomotor nerve supplies several muscles, including the superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique muscles. Therefore, option C is also true. The occulomotor nerve passes through the superior orbital fissure, not the inferior orbital fissure. Therefore, option D is false. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
