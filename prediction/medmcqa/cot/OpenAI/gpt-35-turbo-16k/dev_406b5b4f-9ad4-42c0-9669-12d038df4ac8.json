    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The highest concentration of oxygen is delivered through a mask with a reservoir. This type of mask has a reservoir bag attached to it, which allows for the delivery of high-flow oxygen. The reservoir bag fills with oxygen during inhalation and delivers a higher concentration of oxygen during exhalation. Nasal cannula delivers a lower concentration of oxygen, typically around 24-44%. Venturi mask delivers a more precise concentration of oxygen, but it is not the highest concentration. Bag and mask can deliver high concentrations of oxygen, but it requires proper technique and may not be as effective as a mask with a reservoir.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
