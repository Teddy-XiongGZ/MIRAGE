    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Brittle bone syndrome, also known as osteogenesis imperfecta, is a genetic disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily. To determine the cause of brittle bone syndrome, we need to consider the underlying mechanisms involved in bone formation and maintenance. A. Improper synthesis of procollagen: Collagen is the main protein component of bone, and it provides strength and flexibility. Improper synthesis of procollagen, which is the precursor to collagen, can lead to weak bones. This is a possible cause of brittle bone syndrome. B. Polymerisation of collagen: Collagen molecules need to properly polymerize to form a strong network within the bone. If there is a defect in the polymerization process, it can result in weak bones. However, this is not a commonly recognized cause of brittle bone syndrome. C. Increased osteoclastic activity: Osteoclasts are cells responsible for bone resorption, which is a normal part of bone remodeling. However, if there is an excessive increase in osteoclastic activity, it can lead to bone loss and fragility. This is not a cause of brittle bone syndrome. D. Increased fibroblastic activity: Fibroblasts are cells involved in wound healing and tissue repair. While increased fibroblastic activity can be seen in certain conditions, it is not a known cause of brittle bone syndrome. Based on the above analysis, the most likely cause of brittle bone syndrome is A. Improper synthesis of procollagen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
