    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"During the absolute refractory period, a neuron is unable to generate another action potential regardless of the strength of the stimulus. This is due to the inactivation of sodium channels. When an action potential is generated, sodium channels open and allow sodium ions to enter the neuron, depolarizing the membrane. However, after a short period of time, these sodium channels become inactivated and cannot be reopened until the membrane potential returns to its resting state. This inactivation prevents the generation of another action potential, leading to the absolute refractory period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Closure of inactivated Na channels\"}"
