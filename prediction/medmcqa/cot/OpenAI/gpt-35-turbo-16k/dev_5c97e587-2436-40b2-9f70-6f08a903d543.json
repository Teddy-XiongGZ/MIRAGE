    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To decrease patient radiation in intraoral radiographs, we need to consider the factors that affect radiation exposure. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. High speed film: High speed film requires less exposure time, which can reduce patient radiation.\\n\\nB. Intensifying screens: Intensifying screens are used in extraoral radiography and not intraoral radiography, so they do not affect patient radiation in this context.\\n\\nC. Lead apron: Lead aprons are used to protect the patient from scattered radiation, so they can help decrease patient radiation.\\n\\nD. Decreasing kVp: Decreasing the kilovoltage peak (kVp) reduces the energy of the X-rays, which can decrease patient radiation.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the option that does not decrease patient radiation in intraoral radiographs is B. Intensifying screens.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
