    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Extraction of disto-angular impaction of mandibular 3rd molar can cause several complications. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Slippage in lingual pouch: This refers to the displacement of the tooth or its fragments into the lingual pouch during extraction. While this can occur during any extraction, it is not specific to disto-angular impaction of the mandibular 3rd molar.\\n\\nB. # of ramus of mandible: It is unclear what '# of ramus of mandible' refers to. This option does not provide a clear explanation of a complication that can occur during the extraction.\\n\\nC. Excessive Haemorrhage: This is a potential complication of any tooth extraction, including disto-angular impaction of the mandibular 3rd molar. The extraction can cause bleeding from the surrounding tissues, and if it is excessive, it may require additional measures to control the bleeding.\\n\\nD. Dry socket: Dry socket, also known as alveolar osteitis, is a common complication of tooth extraction. It occurs when the blood clot that normally forms in the extraction socket is dislodged or dissolves, leaving the underlying bone exposed. While dry socket can occur after the extraction of any tooth, it is not specific to disto-angular impaction of the mandibular 3rd molar.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most likely complication of extraction of disto-angular impaction of mandibular 3rd molar is excessive haemorrhage (Option C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
