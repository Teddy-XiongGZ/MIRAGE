    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To evaluate any obstruction in the nasal pathway, several tests can be performed. The mirror test involves using a mirror to visualize the nasal passages and identify any visible obstructions. However, this test may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the obstruction. The butterfly test is not a recognized medical test for evaluating nasal obstruction. To check the size of the nostril, a physical examination can be performed, but this may not provide information about the specific cause of the obstruction. Rhinomanometry is a gold standard test for evaluating nasal obstruction. It measures the airflow and pressure in the nasal passages, providing objective data about the degree and location of the obstruction. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Rhinomanometry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
