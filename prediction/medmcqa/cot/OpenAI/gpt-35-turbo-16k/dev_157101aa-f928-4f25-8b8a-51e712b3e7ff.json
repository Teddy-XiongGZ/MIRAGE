    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The probability of a test detecting a truly positive person from the population of diseased can be determined by the sensitivity of the test. Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who have the disease. Specificity, on the other hand, is the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who do not have the disease. Positive predictive value is the probability that a person has the disease given a positive test result. Likelihood ratio is a measure of how much a test result changes the odds of having the disease. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Sensitivity of the test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
