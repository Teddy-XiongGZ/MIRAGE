    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a condition that occurs when a fetus is exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. It can cause a range of physical, mental, and behavioral problems. To determine the sequelae of FAS, we need to understand the potential effects of alcohol exposure on the developing fetus. A. Macrocephaly refers to an abnormally large head size. This can be a possible sequelae of FAS as alcohol exposure during pregnancy can affect the growth and development of the brain. B. Holoprosencephaly is a severe brain malformation where the forebrain fails to divide properly. This condition is not typically associated with FAS. C. Microcephaly refers to an abnormally small head size. This can be a possible sequelae of FAS as alcohol exposure during pregnancy can lead to impaired brain growth and development. D. Thinning of the corpus callosum is a possible sequelae of FAS. The corpus callosum is a structure that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, and alcohol exposure during pregnancy can lead to abnormalities in its development. Based on this information, the correct answer is B. Holoprosencephaly, as it is not typically associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
