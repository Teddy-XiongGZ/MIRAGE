    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The volume of distribution (Vd) of a drug is a pharmacokinetic parameter that describes the extent to which a drug distributes into the tissues. A low volume of distribution means that the drug is primarily confined to the blood plasma and does not distribute extensively into the tissues. This can be due to factors such as high protein binding or limited tissue penetration. Considering this, the correct answer is B. Does not accumulate in tissues.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
