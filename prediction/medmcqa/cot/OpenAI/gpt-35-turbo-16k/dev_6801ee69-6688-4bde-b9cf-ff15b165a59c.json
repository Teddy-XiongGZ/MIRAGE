    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method used to measure the oxygen saturation level in the blood. It works by shining a light through a part of the body, usually a finger or earlobe, and measuring the amount of light absorbed by the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. This measurement provides an estimate of the oxygen saturation level, which is the percentage of hemoglobin that is bound to oxygen. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Oxygen saturation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
