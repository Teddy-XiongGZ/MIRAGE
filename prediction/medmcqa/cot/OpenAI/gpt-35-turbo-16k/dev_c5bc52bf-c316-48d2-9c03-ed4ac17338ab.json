    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"PCOD (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a condition characterized by hormonal imbalances and the formation of multiple cysts on the ovaries. One of the common symptoms of PCOD is infertility. The treatment of PCOD-related infertility typically involves addressing the underlying hormonal imbalances and promoting ovulation. A. Clomiphene is a medication commonly used to induce ovulation in women with PCOD. It works by stimulating the release of hormones that trigger the development and release of mature eggs from the ovaries. Therefore, Clomiphene is often given to women with PCOD and infertility. B. Tamoxifen is a medication primarily used for the treatment of breast cancer. It is not typically used for the treatment of PCOD-related infertility. C. OCPs (Oral Contraceptive Pills) are often prescribed to women with PCOD to regulate their menstrual cycles and reduce symptoms such as irregular periods and excessive hair growth. However, if a woman with PCOD is trying to conceive, OCPs would not be given as they prevent ovulation. D. Metformin is a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is also sometimes prescribed to women with PCOD to help regulate their menstrual cycles and improve fertility. Therefore, Metformin can be given to a 30-year-old lady with PCOD and infertility. Based on the information provided, the drug that would not be given in PCOD in a 30-year-old lady with infertility is C. OCPs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
