    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Lymphatic spread refers to the spread of cancer cells through the lymphatic system. To determine which malignancy is least commonly associated with lymphatic spread, we need to consider the characteristics of each type of cancer. Basal Cell Carcinoma is a slow-growing skin cancer that rarely metastasizes and is unlikely to spread through the lymphatic system. Squamous Cell Carcinoma is also a type of skin cancer that can spread to lymph nodes, although it is less likely to do so compared to other types of cancer. Malignant Melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer that frequently spreads to lymph nodes and other distant sites. Merkel Cell Carcinoma is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer that often spreads to lymph nodes and other organs. Based on this information, the answer is A. Basal Cell Carcinoma, as it is the least commonly associated with lymphatic spread.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
