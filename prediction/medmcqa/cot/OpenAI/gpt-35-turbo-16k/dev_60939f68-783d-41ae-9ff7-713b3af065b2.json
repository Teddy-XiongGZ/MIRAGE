    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Orthodontic appliances that take advantage of growth are typically used during the mixed dentition stage, which is the period when both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth are present. This is because during this stage, the jaw is still growing and can be guided to achieve proper alignment. The early mixed dentition refers to the stage when the first permanent molars have erupted, which is usually around 6-9 years of age. The late mixed dentition refers to the stage when most or all of the permanent teeth have erupted, which is usually around 10-12 years of age. The primary dentition stage refers to the period when only primary teeth are present, typically from birth to around 6 years of age. The early permanent dentition refers to the stage when most or all of the permanent teeth have erupted, usually around 12-14 years of age. Based on this information, the optimal time to employ an orthodontic appliance that takes advantage of growth is during the early mixed dentition stage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
