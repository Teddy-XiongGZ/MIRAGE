    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is a condition characterized by high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can lead to various complications. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Renal failure: PIH can cause damage to the kidneys, leading to renal failure. Therefore, this is a likely complication.\\n\\nB. Pre-eclampsia: Pre-eclampsia is a severe form of PIH that involves high blood pressure and organ damage. It is a common complication of PIH, so this is a likely complication.\\n\\nC. HELLP syndrome: HELLP syndrome is a serious condition that can occur in women with PIH. It involves liver dysfunction, low platelet count, and hemolysis. Therefore, this is a likely complication.\\n\\nD. Fetal macrosomia: Fetal macrosomia refers to a baby that is larger than average. While PIH can affect fetal growth, fetal macrosomia is not directly associated with PIH. Therefore, this is the least likely complication of PIH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
