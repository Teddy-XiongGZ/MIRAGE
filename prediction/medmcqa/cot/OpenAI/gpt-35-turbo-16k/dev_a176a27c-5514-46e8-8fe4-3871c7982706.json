    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a tooth is extracted during an acute infection, it is important to consider the potential consequences. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Can cause extensive spread of infection: This is a possibility as the extraction procedure can disrupt the infected area and potentially spread the infection further.\\n\\nB. Helps drainage and relieves pain if proper antibiotic is given and its adequate blood level is reached: This is a valid option as extracting the tooth can help drain the infection and relieve pain, especially if the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics.\\n\\nC. Can cause sudden death due to pulmonary embolism: This option is unlikely as pulmonary embolism is not directly related to tooth extraction during acute infection.\\n\\nD. Can lead to trigeminal neuralgia in the postoperative period: While trigeminal neuralgia can occur after dental procedures, it is not specifically associated with tooth extraction during acute infection.\\n\\nConsidering the above, the most appropriate answer is B. Helps drainage and relieves pain if proper antibiotic is given and its adequate blood level is reached.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
