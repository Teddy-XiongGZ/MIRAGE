    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Rb gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle. When the Rb gene is phosphorylated, it becomes inactive and releases the transcription factor E2F, which promotes the progression of the cell cycle. Therefore, if the Rb gene phosphorylation is defective, it means that the Rb gene cannot be inactivated, and E2F cannot be released. As a result, the cell cycle will be inhibited, and the cell will not progress to the next phase. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Cell cycle will stop at GI phase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
