    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the anatomy of the maxillary first molar and the location of the pulp horns. The maxillary first molar has three pulp horns: mesiolingual, mesiobuccal, and distolingual. When preparing a Class II cavity on a maxillary first molar, the pulp horns that are likely to get exposed are the ones that are closest to the cavity preparation. In a Class II cavity, the cavity walls extend from the mesial surface to the distal surface of the tooth. Therefore, the pulp horns that are likely to get exposed are the mesiolingual and mesiobuccal pulp horns.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
