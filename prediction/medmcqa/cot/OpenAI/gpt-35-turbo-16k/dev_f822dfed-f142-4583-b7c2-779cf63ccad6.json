    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Fish tail deformity is a term used to describe a specific type of deformity that can occur after a fracture. It is characterized by a prominent bony prominence at the fracture site, resembling the tail of a fish. To determine which bone is most likely to be associated with fish tail deformity in a child, we need to consider the growth plates and the common fractures in pediatric patients. The distal tibia, distal femur, distal humerus, and distal radius are all common sites of fractures in children. However, fish tail deformity is most commonly seen after a fracture of the distal radius. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Distal Radius.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
