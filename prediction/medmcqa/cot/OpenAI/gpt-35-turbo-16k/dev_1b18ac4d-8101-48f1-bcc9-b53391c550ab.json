    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, causing a change in the enzyme's conformation and reducing its activity. This type of inhibition does not affect the binding of the substrate to the enzyme's active site. Since non-competitive inhibitors do not compete with the substrate for binding to the active site, they do not affect the Km (substrate concentration at which the enzyme achieves half of its maximum velocity). Therefore, the Km should remain unchanged. However, non-competitive inhibitors reduce the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme by decreasing the number of active enzyme molecules available. This is because the inhibitor binds to the enzyme and prevents it from functioning at its maximum capacity. Therefore, the effect of acetazolamide, a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase enzyme, should be a decrease in Vmax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Decrease in Vmax\"}"
