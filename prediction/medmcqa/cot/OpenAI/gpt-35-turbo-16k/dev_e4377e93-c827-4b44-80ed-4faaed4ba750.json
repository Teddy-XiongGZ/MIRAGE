    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Direct bonded orthodontic stainless steel brackets derive retention with composite because of a combination of mechanical and chemical interlock. The mechanical interlock is achieved through the mesh at the bracket base, which provides a physical grip between the bracket and the composite. The chemical interlock occurs when the composite material chemically bonds to the bracket base, creating a strong adhesive connection. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both mechanical and chemical interlock of composite with the bracket base.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
