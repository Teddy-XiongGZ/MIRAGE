    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To find the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times, we need to calculate the confidence interval. The formula for the confidence interval is: Lower limit = average - (Z * (SD / sqrt(n))), where Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, SD is the standard deviation, and n is the sample size. In this case, the Z-score for a 95% confidence level is approximately 1.96. Plugging in the values, we get: Lower limit = 30 - (1.96 * (1.0 / sqrt(100))) = 30 - (1.96 * 0.1) = 30 - 0.196 = 29.804. Therefore, the lower limit of the average IOP that can be expected 95% of times is approximately 29.804.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. 28\"}"
