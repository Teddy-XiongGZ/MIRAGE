    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the ratio of mesiodistal width to height of the crown of the maxillary canine, we need to compare the width and height measurements. The mesiodistal width refers to the width of the tooth from the front (mesial) to the back (distal) surface. The height refers to the vertical measurement of the crown. Let's compare the options: A. 8:10 - This means the width is 8 units and the height is 10 units. B. 10:08 - This means the width is 10 units and the height is 8 units. C. 6:08 - This means the width is 6 units and the height is 8 units. D. 8:06 - This means the width is 8 units and the height is 6 units. Based on the options, the correct ratio would be the one that represents the actual ratio of the mesiodistal width to the height of the crown of the maxillary canine. The correct answer is A. 8:10, as it represents a wider width compared to the height of the crown.\" \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
