    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The angle of the jaw is the posterior part of the mandible where it curves upward. To determine the nerve supply of the angle of the jaw, we need to consider the innervation of the mandible. The mandibular nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), provides sensory innervation to the lower teeth, gums, and lower lip. The maxillary nerve, also a branch of the trigeminal nerve, supplies sensory innervation to the upper teeth, gums, and upper lip. The lesser occipital nerve is a branch of the cervical plexus and provides sensory innervation to the skin of the posterior part of the scalp. The greater auricular nerve is also a branch of the cervical plexus and provides sensory innervation to the skin over the parotid gland and the external ear. Considering the location of the angle of the jaw, the nerve supply is most likely from the mandibular nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A. Mandibular nerve\"}"
