    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Apert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by craniosynostosis, which is the premature fusion of the skull bones. This leads to a characteristic head shape, known as bicoronal craniosynostosis. Additionally, Apert syndrome is also associated with midface hypoplasia, which refers to underdevelopment of the middle part of the face. Mandibular hypoplasia, which is underdevelopment of the lower jaw, is also a common feature of Apert syndrome. Finally, complex syndactyly, which is the fusion of fingers and toes, is another diagnostic feature of Apert syndrome. Therefore, the answer choice that is not a diagnostic feature of Apert syndrome is C. Mandibular hypoplasia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
