    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which tooth in the mandibular arch is most likely to be displaced due to arch size discrepancy, we need to consider the size and position of the teeth in relation to the arch. The first molar is the largest tooth in the mandibular arch and is usually well-positioned in the arch. The second molar is also large but is located more distally in the arch. The premolars are smaller in size and are located anterior to the molars. Considering that arch size discrepancy would most likely affect the teeth located more distally, the tooth that is most likely to be displaced due to arch size discrepancy is the second molar.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
