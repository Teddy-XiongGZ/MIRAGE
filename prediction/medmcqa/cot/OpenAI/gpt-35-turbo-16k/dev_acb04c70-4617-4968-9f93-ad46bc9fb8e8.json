    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria of cells. It is an important part of cellular respiration, which generates energy for the cell. In the citric acid cycle, a molecule of citric acid (also known as citrate) is gradually broken down into carbon dioxide and energy-rich molecules. One of the intermediate products formed in the citric acid cycle is oxaloacetic acid. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Oxaloacetic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
