    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Galeazzi's fracture dislocation is a specific type of forearm fracture-dislocation. It involves a fracture of the radius along with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. The most common mechanism of injury is a fall onto an outstretched hand. The fracture typically occurs at the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the radius. The dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint is usually dorsal. Option A is incorrect because it only mentions an ulnar shaft fracture, which is not a characteristic feature of Galeazzi's fracture dislocation. Option B is incorrect because it mentions a radial collateral ligament tear, which is not typically associated with Galeazzi's fracture dislocation. Option C is incorrect because it mentions a triangular fibro-cailage complex (TFCC) tear, which is not typically associated with Galeazzi's fracture dislocation. The correct answer is option D. Galeazzi's fracture dislocation is characterized by an interosseous membrane tear along with a triangular fibro-cailage complex (TFCC) tear and a radial shaft fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
