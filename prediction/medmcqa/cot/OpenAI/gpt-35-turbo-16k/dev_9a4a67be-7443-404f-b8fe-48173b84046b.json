    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what centric interference and working interference are. Centric interference refers to any contact between the teeth that occurs when the jaw is in its most stable and repeatable position, known as centric relation. Working interference, on the other hand, refers to any contact between the teeth that occurs during functional movements, such as chewing or speaking. Reducing supporting cusps in natural dentition can potentially help in removing both centric and working interferences. Supporting cusps are the cusps of the teeth that provide stability and support during chewing. By reducing the height or size of these cusps, the likelihood of interferences occurring can be reduced. Therefore, the answer to the question is: A. Yes, it is possible to remove centric interference and working interference by reducing supporting cusps in natural dentition.\" , \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
