    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of the pontic refers to the dimension from the facial surface to the lingual surface of the pontic. To determine this dimension, we need to consider the factors that affect the space available for the pontic. A. The length of the pontic: The length of the pontic refers to the mesiodistal dimension. It does not directly determine the faciolingual dimension. B. The masticatory force of the patient: The masticatory force of the patient does not directly determine the faciolingual dimension of the pontic. C. The position of the opposing contact areas: The position of the opposing contact areas refers to the contact points between the pontic and the opposing teeth. While this may affect the overall design of the pontic, it does not primarily determine the faciolingual dimension. D. The width and crestal position of the edentulous ridge: The width and crestal position of the edentulous ridge refers to the space available for the pontic. This directly affects the faciolingual dimension of the occlusal portion of the pontic. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
