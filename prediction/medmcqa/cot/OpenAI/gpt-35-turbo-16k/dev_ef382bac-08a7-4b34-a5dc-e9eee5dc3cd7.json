    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Isosorbide 5-mononitrate is a long-acting nitrate used for the prevention and treatment of angina. Let's evaluate each option to determine why it is preferred. A. Less tolerance develops: Tolerance refers to a decreased response to a drug over time. While isosorbide 5-mononitrate can still lead to tolerance, it is generally associated with less tolerance compared to other nitrates. B. Sublingual absorption is better: Isosorbide 5-mononitrate is not typically administered sublingually, so this option is not applicable. C. Longer duration of action: Isosorbide 5-mononitrate has a longer duration of action compared to other nitrates, which allows for less frequent dosing. D. Direct coronary vasodilatory action is more: Isosorbide 5-mononitrate, like other nitrates, primarily acts by dilating veins rather than directly dilating coronary arteries. Therefore, this option is not applicable. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is C. Longer duration of action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
