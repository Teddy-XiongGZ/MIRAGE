    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After a patient is identified with Hepatitis B positive, it is important to take proper precautions to prevent the spread of the infection. Hepatitis B is a bloodborne virus that can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. Therefore, it is necessary to properly disinfect or sterilize any instruments that may have come into contact with the patient's blood or bodily fluids. Option A, cleaning with water for 2 minutes, is not sufficient to eliminate the Hepatitis B virus. Water alone is not effective in killing the virus. Option B, burning the instruments in a flame, is not necessary and may not be practical for all types of instruments. While heat can effectively kill the virus, there are other methods that can be used to achieve the same result without destroying the instruments. Option C, washing the instruments and sending them for autoclave, is the correct choice. Autoclaving is a process that uses high pressure and steam to sterilize instruments. This method is effective in killing the Hepatitis B virus and other pathogens. Therefore, the answer is C. Instruments should be washed and sent for autoclave.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
