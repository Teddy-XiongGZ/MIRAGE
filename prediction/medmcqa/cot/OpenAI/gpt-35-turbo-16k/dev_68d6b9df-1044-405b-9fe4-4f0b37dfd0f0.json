    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which amino acid has a positive charge at physiological pH, we need to consider the pKa values of the amino acid side chains. At physiological pH, which is around 7.4, the amino acid side chains can either be protonated (positive charge) or deprotonated (neutral or negative charge). Valine and Isoleucine do not have any charged side chains, so they are unlikely to have a positive charge. Aspartic acid has a pKa value of around 3.9, which means its side chain carboxyl group is likely to be deprotonated at physiological pH, resulting in a negative charge. Arginine, on the other hand, has a pKa value of around 12.5, which means its side chain guanidinium group is likely to be protonated at physiological pH, resulting in a positive charge. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Arginine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
