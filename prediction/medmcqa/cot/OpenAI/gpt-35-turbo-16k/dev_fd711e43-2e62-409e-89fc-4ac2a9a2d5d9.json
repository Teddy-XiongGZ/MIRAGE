    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The important marker of male infertility in semen analysis is typically the sperm count. Sperm count refers to the number of sperm present in a given sample of semen. A low sperm count, also known as oligospermia, can indicate a problem with sperm production or function, which can contribute to male infertility. Motility refers to the ability of sperm to move properly, concentration refers to the number of sperm per milliliter of semen, and volume refers to the amount of semen produced during ejaculation. While these factors are also important in semen analysis, the sperm count is typically the most significant marker of male infertility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Sperm Count\"}"
