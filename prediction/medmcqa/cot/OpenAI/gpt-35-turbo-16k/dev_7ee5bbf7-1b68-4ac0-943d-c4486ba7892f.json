    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"False positive results on EPT testing occur when the test indicates a positive response (sensation) even though the tooth is non-vital. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Immature apex: An immature apex refers to the incomplete development of the root of a tooth. This can lead to false positive results on EPT testing because the nerve tissue may not be fully developed, resulting in a diminished response to the test. Therefore, this condition can contribute to false positive results.\\n\\nB. Improper Isolation: Proper isolation is crucial during EPT testing to ensure accurate results. If the tooth being tested is not properly isolated, it may come into contact with adjacent teeth or tissues, leading to false positive results. Therefore, this condition can contribute to false positive results.\\n\\nC. Partial Pulpal Necrosis: Pulpal necrosis refers to the death of the dental pulp inside a tooth. If only a portion of the pulp is necrotic, it can still produce a response to EPT testing, leading to false positive results. Therefore, this condition can contribute to false positive results.\\n\\nD. Anxiety: Anxiety can potentially affect the patient's perception of pain or sensation during EPT testing. However, it is not a direct cause of false positive results. Therefore, this condition is not directly related to false positive results on EPT testing.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the answer choice that is not true regarding false positive results on EPT testing is D. Anxiety.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
