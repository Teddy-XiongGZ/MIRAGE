    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which metal alloy is used to reduce hardness of orthodontic wires, we need to consider the properties of each metal. Chromium is commonly used in stainless steel alloys, but it does not significantly affect the hardness of the wire. Cobalt is often used in cobalt-chromium alloys, which are known for their high strength and hardness. Silicon is not typically used in orthodontic wires. Carbon, on the other hand, is commonly added to steel alloys to reduce hardness and increase flexibility. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Carbon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
