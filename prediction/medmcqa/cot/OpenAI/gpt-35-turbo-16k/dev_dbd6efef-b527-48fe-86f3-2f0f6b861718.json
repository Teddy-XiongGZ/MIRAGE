    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When filling a bony defect, there are several options to consider. Hydroxy apatite is a synthetic material that can be used, but it may not provide the same structural support as natural bone. A donor graft involves taking bone from a deceased donor and transplanting it into the defect. This can be a good option, but there is a risk of rejection or disease transmission. Xenograft involves using bone from a different species, such as bovine or porcine bone. This can be effective, but there is also a risk of rejection. Autograft involves taking bone from the patient's own body, usually from another site, and transplanting it into the defect. This is often considered the best option because it provides the most compatible and structurally sound material.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D. Autograft\"}"
