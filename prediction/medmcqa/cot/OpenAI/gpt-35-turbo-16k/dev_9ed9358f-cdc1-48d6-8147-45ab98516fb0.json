    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The standard deviation of means measures the variability or dispersion of the sample means. It quantifies how much the sample means deviate from the population mean. This measure is used to estimate the standard error of the mean, which is a measure of the precision of the sample mean estimate. The standard error of the mean is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the sample means by the square root of the sample size. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Sampling error.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
