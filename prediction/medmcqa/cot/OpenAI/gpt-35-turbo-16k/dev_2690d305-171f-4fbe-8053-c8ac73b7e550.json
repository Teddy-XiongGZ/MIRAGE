    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Steroids are known to have anti-inflammatory properties. They work by suppressing the immune system and reducing inflammation. This can be beneficial in certain conditions where inflammation is causing harm. However, steroids can also have negative effects on tissue repair and healing. They can delay the healing process by reducing the rate of tissue repair. Therefore, option A is correct. Steroids do not exacerbate the inflammatory response, so option B is incorrect. Steroids are generally not safe to be given to immunocompromised patients as they further suppress the immune system, making the patient more susceptible to infections. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Steroids are not indicated in oral thrush, which is a fungal infection. In fact, steroids can worsen fungal infections by suppressing the immune system. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
