    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The presence of a circulating antibody directed to the intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium is a characteristic feature of autoimmune blistering disorders. Lichen planus and verrucous vulgaris are not autoimmune blistering disorders, so they can be ruled out. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder, but the circulating antibody in this condition is directed against the basement membrane zone, not the intercellular cementing substance. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disorder where the circulating antibody is directed against the intercellular cementing substance of stratified squamous epithelium. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Pemphigus vulgaris.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
