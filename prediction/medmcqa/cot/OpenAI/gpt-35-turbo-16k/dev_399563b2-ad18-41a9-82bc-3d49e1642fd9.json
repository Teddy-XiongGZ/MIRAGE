    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Cyanide is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, which is a key enzyme in the electron transport chain. This inhibition leads to a decrease in ATP production. The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, is an integral part of the electron transport chain. Cyanide does not directly block any specific enzyme in the citric acid cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
