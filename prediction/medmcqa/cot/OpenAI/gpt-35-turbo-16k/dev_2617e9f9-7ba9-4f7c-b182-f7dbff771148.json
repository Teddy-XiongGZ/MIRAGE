    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The lymphatic drainage of the tongue is primarily through the deep cervical lymph nodes. The deep cervical lymph nodes can be divided into several groups, including the central, jugulodigastric, and jugulo-omohyoid nodes. The central group of deep cervical lymph nodes is located along the internal jugular vein and receives lymphatic drainage from the tongue. The ventral group of deep cervical lymph nodes is located along the anterior jugular vein and drains lymph from the anterior part of the neck. The posterior group of deep cervical lymph nodes is located along the spinal accessory nerve and drains lymph from the posterior part of the neck. The marginal group of deep cervical lymph nodes is located along the external jugular vein and drains lymph from the superficial structures of the neck. Based on this information, the lymph from the tongue is not drained by the ventral, posterior, or marginal vessels. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Central.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
