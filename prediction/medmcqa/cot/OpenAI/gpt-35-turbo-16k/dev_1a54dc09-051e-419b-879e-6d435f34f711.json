    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which of the following is considered as a high-risk infant, we need to understand what factors contribute to a high-risk status. High-risk infants are those who have a higher likelihood of experiencing health complications or developmental issues. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Working mother: Being born to a working mother does not inherently make an infant high risk. The mother's occupation does not directly impact the infant's health.\\n\\nB. Antenatal preeclampsia: Preeclampsia is a condition characterized by high blood pressure and organ damage during pregnancy. Infants born to mothers with preeclampsia may be at higher risk due to potential complications during pregnancy and delivery. Therefore, antenatal preeclampsia is a potential high-risk factor for infants.\\n\\nC. Third child: Being the third child does not automatically classify an infant as high risk. The number of siblings does not directly impact the infant's health.\\n\\nD. Twins: Twins are considered high-risk infants due to the increased likelihood of premature birth, low birth weight, and other complications associated with multiple pregnancies. Therefore, twins are a potential high-risk factor for infants.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the correct answer is either B. Antenatal preeclampsia or D. Twins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Antenatal preeclampsia or D. Twins\"}"
