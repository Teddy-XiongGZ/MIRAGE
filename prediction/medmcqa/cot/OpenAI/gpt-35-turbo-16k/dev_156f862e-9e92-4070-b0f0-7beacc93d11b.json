    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The loading dose of a drug is the initial dose given to rapidly achieve therapeutic drug levels in the body. To determine the loading dose, we need to consider the volume of distribution (Vd) of the drug. The volume of distribution is a pharmacokinetic parameter that describes the apparent space in the body where the drug is distributed. It is calculated by dividing the amount of drug in the body by the plasma concentration of the drug. The loading dose is directly proportional to the volume of distribution. Therefore, the major determinant of the loading dose of a drug is the volume of distribution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
