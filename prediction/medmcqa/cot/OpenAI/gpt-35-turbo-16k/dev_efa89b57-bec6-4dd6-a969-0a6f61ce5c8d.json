    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a driver wearing a seat belt applies the brake suddenly to avoid a collision, the body is subjected to a rapid deceleration. This can cause the internal organs to move within the abdominal cavity, potentially leading to injury. The liver, spleen, mesentery, and abdominal aorta are all located in the abdominal cavity and can be at risk of injury in such situations. However, the spleen is the most likely to be injured in this scenario. The spleen is located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, and its position makes it more susceptible to injury during sudden deceleration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Spleen\"}"
