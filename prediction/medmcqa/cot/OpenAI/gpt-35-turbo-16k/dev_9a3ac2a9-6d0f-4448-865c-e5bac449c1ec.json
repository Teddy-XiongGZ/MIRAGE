    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the tetanizing frequency, we need to determine the total time for one complete cycle of muscle twitch. This includes the latent period, contraction time, and relaxation time. The total time for one complete cycle is the sum of these three time periods. In this case, the total time for one complete cycle is 10 ms + 40 ms + 50 ms = 100 ms. The tetanizing frequency is the reciprocal of the total time for one complete cycle. Therefore, the tetanizing frequency is 1 / 100 ms = 10 Hz.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
