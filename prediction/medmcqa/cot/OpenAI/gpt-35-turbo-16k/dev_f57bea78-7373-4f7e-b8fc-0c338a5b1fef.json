    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about what happens when the instrument with the primary cutting edge is perpendicular to the blade. To answer this, we need to understand what the 4 digit formula refers to. The 4 digit formula is a method used to identify dental instruments based on their characteristics. The formula consists of four digits, each representing a specific characteristic of the instrument. The first digit represents the function or use of the instrument, the second digit represents the shape or design, the third digit represents the blade or working end, and the fourth digit represents the handle or shank. Now, if the instrument with the primary cutting edge is perpendicular to the blade, it means that the cutting edge is at a 90-degree angle to the blade. In this position, the cutting edge is not aligned with the blade, which can affect the functionality and characteristics of the instrument. Based on this understanding, we can conclude that the answer is not A, B, or D because omitting any of the digits in the 4 digit formula would not be related to the position of the cutting edge. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The 3rd digit of the 4 digit formula is omitted when the instrument with the primary cutting edge is perpendicular to the blade.\" \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
