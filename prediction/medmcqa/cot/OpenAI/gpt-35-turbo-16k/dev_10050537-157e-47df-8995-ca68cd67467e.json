    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anti-cholinergic drug doesn't cross the blood brain barrier and placenta, we need to consider the properties of each drug. The blood brain barrier is a protective barrier that prevents certain substances from entering the brain, while the placenta acts as a barrier between the mother and fetus. Anti-cholinergic drugs that do not cross these barriers are considered to have limited central nervous system effects and are safer to use in certain populations. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Glycopyrrolate bromide: Glycopyrrolate is a quaternary ammonium compound, which means it has a positive charge and is less likely to cross lipid membranes like the blood brain barrier and placenta. Therefore, it is a potential candidate.\\n\\nB. Hyoscine bromide: Hyoscine bromide, also known as scopolamine, is a tertiary amine and can cross the blood brain barrier. It is commonly used to treat motion sickness and has central nervous system effects. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.\\n\\nC. Hyoscine butylbromide: Hyoscine butylbromide, also known as buscopan, is a quaternary ammonium compound similar to glycopyrrolate. It is primarily used as a smooth muscle relaxant and does not have significant central nervous system effects. Therefore, it is a potential candidate.\\n\\nD. Atropine: Atropine is a tertiary amine and can cross the blood brain barrier. It is a potent anti-cholinergic drug and has central nervous system effects. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, the anti-cholinergic drug that doesn't cross the blood brain barrier and placenta is either A. Glycopyrrolate bromide or C. Hyoscine butylbromide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/C\"}"
