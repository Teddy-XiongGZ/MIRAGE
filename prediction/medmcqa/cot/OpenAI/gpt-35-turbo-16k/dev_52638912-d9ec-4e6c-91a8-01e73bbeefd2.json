    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Uniparental disomy (UPD) is a condition in which both copies of a chromosome or part of a chromosome are inherited from one parent, instead of one copy from each parent. This can occur due to errors in meiosis or during fertilization. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are both associated with UPD, specifically UPD of chromosome 15. Russell-Silver syndrome is also associated with UPD, specifically UPD of chromosome 7. Bloom syndrome, on the other hand, is not typically associated with UPD. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Bloom syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
