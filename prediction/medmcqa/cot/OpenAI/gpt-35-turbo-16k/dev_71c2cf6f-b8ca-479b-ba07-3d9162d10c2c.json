    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Gingival recession refers to the exposure of the root surface of a tooth due to the loss of gum tissue. It can be caused by various factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Tooth brush trauma: Brushing too hard or using a toothbrush with hard bristles can cause gum tissue to recede, but it is not the most common cause.\\n\\nB. TFO: TFO stands for traumatic occlusion, which refers to excessive forces on the teeth during biting or chewing. While traumatic occlusion can contribute to gingival recession, it is not the most common cause.\\n\\nC. Deflective contacts: Deflective contacts occur when teeth do not come together properly during biting or chewing. This can lead to gum tissue being pushed away from the tooth, contributing to recession. However, it is not the most common cause.\\n\\nD. ANUG: ANUG stands for Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis, which is a severe form of gum disease. While ANUG can cause gum tissue to recede, it is not the most common cause.\\n\\nConsidering the above information, the most common cause of gingival recession is tooth brush trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
