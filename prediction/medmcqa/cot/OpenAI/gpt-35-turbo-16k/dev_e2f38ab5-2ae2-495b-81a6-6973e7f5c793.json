    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After removal of the periodontal pack, the presence of a large round elevated granulation tissue suggests a localized inflammatory response. Let's consider each option:\\n\\nA. Allergy to components in the pack: While an allergic reaction is possible, it would typically present with generalized symptoms such as itching, redness, and swelling, rather than a localized granulation tissue.\\n\\nB. Normal finding: Granulation tissue is not a normal finding after the removal of a periodontal pack. It indicates an abnormal healing response.\\n\\nC. Incomplete calculus removal: Incomplete calculus removal can lead to persistent inflammation and delayed healing, but it would not typically present as a large round elevated granulation tissue.\\n\\nD. Mechanical irritation due to the periodontal pack: Mechanical irritation from the periodontal pack can cause localized inflammation and the formation of granulation tissue. This is the most likely cause in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
