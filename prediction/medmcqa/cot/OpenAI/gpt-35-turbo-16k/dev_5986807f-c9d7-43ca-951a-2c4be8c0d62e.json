    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which muscle has parallel oriented fibers, we need to understand the arrangement of muscle fibers in each option. Parallel oriented fibers are arranged in a parallel fashion, meaning they run parallel to the long axis of the muscle. The other type of muscle fiber arrangement is pennate, where the fibers are obliquely arranged in relation to the long axis of the muscle. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Saorius: The saorius muscle has obliquely arranged fibers, not parallel.\\nB. Rectus abdominis: The rectus abdominis muscle has parallel oriented fibers, so it is not the correct answer.\\nC. Sternohyoid: The sternohyoid muscle has parallel oriented fibers, so it is not the correct answer.\\nD. Tibialis anterior: The tibialis anterior muscle has obliquely arranged fibers, not parallel.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B. Rectus abdominis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
