    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"X-Linked SCID is a severe combined immunodeficiency disorder that is caused by a mutation in the IL2RG gene. This gene encodes for the common gamma chain, which is a component of several cytokine receptors involved in immune cell development and function. EGFR, CD23, and IL6 are not directly associated with X-Linked SCID, so they can be ruled out as potential genes involved in this disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
