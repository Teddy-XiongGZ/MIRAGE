    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Accessory canals are additional small canals that may branch off from the main root canal of a tooth. In the case of mandibular molars, accessory canals can arise from either the distal root or the mesial root. However, the question asks about the major location of the accessory canal. To determine this, we need to consider the anatomy of mandibular molars. Mandibular molars typically have two roots - a mesial root and a distal root. The mesial root is usually larger and longer than the distal root. Therefore, it is more likely for an accessory canal to arise from the mesial root rather than the distal root. So, the answer is B. Mesial root.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
