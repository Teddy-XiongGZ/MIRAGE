    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 20-year-old male presenting with hard painless testicular swelling. The elevated AFP level suggests the possibility of a testicular germ cell tumor. The absence of paraaortic or iliac nodes, as well as mediastinal lymph nodes, suggests that the tumor has not spread to these areas. The ultrasound findings of uniform echotexture and small areas of necrosis surrounding normal structures are consistent with a testicular tumor. Given these findings, the next best step would be to perform a high inguinal orchidectomy, which is the standard treatment for testicular tumors. This procedure involves removing the affected testicle through an incision in the groin. This allows for further evaluation of the tumor and provides the opportunity for accurate staging and histopathological diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
