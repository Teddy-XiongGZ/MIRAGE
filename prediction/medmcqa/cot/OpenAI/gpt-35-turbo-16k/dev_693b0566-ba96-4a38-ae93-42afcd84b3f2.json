    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The facial nerve is a cranial nerve that innervates the muscles of facial expression. It travels through the face and neck, so we need to determine its location in relation to the SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) and the parotidomasseteric fascia. The SMAS is a layer of tissue that lies deep to the skin and superficial to the muscles of facial expression. The parotidomasseteric fascia is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the parotid gland and the masseter muscle. Based on this information, we can conclude that the facial nerve lies either above or below both the SMAS and the parotidomasseteric fascia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B. Above SMAS & below parotidomasseteric fascia\"}"
