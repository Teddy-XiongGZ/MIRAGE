    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When a baby is born with meconium stained liquor, it means that the baby has passed meconium (the baby's first stool) before birth. Meconium staining can be a sign of fetal distress. When determining if a baby is vigorous, we look for signs of good health and well-being. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Tone: The baby's muscle tone is an important indicator of their overall health and vigor. If the baby has good muscle tone, it suggests that they are active and responsive.\\n\\nB. Colour: The color of the baby's skin can provide information about their oxygenation and circulation. If the baby has a normal skin color, it indicates good oxygenation and suggests vigor.\\n\\nC. HR: The baby's heart rate is a vital sign that reflects their cardiovascular function. A normal heart rate is indicative of a vigorous baby.\\n\\nD. Respiration: The baby's ability to breathe and maintain adequate oxygenation is crucial for their well-being. If the baby has normal respiratory effort and oxygen saturation, it suggests vigor.\\n\\nConsidering the above explanations, all of the options (A, B, C, and D) should be taken into account when determining if a baby is vigorous.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
