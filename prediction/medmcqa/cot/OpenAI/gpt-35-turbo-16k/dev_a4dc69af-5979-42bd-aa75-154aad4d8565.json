    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The \u03c99 family refers to omega-9 fatty acids, which are a type of monounsaturated fatty acids. To determine which of the given options belongs to the \u03c99 family, we need to identify the fatty acid that is monounsaturated. Monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond in their carbon chain. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. Oleic Acid: Oleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid with one double bond, so it belongs to the \u03c99 family.\\nB. Linoleic acid: Linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid with two double bonds, so it does not belong to the \u03c99 family.\\nC. Linolenic acid: Linolenic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid with three double bonds, so it does not belong to the \u03c99 family.\\nD. Arachidonic acid: Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid with four double bonds, so it does not belong to the \u03c99 family.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Oleic Acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
