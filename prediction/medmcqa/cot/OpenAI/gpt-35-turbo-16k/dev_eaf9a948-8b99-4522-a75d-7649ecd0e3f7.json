    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 60-year-old male presenting with fever, chills, and dysuria. These symptoms are suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, the elevated PSA level of 7.4 indicates the possibility of prostate pathology. The next best step would be to further evaluate the prostate to determine the cause of the elevated PSA. Option A, repeating the PSA, would not provide any additional information. Option B, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), is a surgical procedure used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and would not be appropriate at this stage. Option D, antibiotics and admit, would be appropriate if the patient's symptoms were solely due to a UTI. However, given the elevated PSA level, further evaluation is necessary. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this patient would be option C, TRUS guided biopsy. This procedure involves obtaining tissue samples from the prostate to determine if there is any evidence of prostate cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
