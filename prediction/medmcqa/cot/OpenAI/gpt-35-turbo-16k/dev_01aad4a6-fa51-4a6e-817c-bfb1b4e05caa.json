    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Good clinical practice is a set of ethical and scientific standards that ensure the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects. It is important to observe good clinical practice in all phases of clinical trials. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Preclinical: Preclinical studies are conducted before human trials and involve testing on animals or in vitro models. Although not directly involving human subjects, good clinical practice is still important to ensure the validity and reliability of the preclinical data.\\n\\nB. Phase I: Phase I trials involve a small number of healthy volunteers and focus on assessing the safety and dosage of the investigational drug. Good clinical practice is crucial in this phase to protect the volunteers and ensure accurate data collection.\\n\\nC. Phase II: Phase II trials involve a larger number of patients and aim to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of the investigational drug. Good clinical practice is essential in this phase to ensure the ethical treatment of patients and reliable data collection.\\n\\nD. Phase V: Phase V does not exist in the standard clinical trial phases. The correct answer is D, as there is no phase called Phase V in clinical trials.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
