    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The sublingual space is located beneath the tongue, while the submandibular space is located beneath the mandible. To determine what divides these two spaces, we need to consider the anatomical structures in the area. A. Fibres of mylohyoid: The mylohyoid muscle forms the floor of the mouth and does not directly divide the sublingual and submandibular spaces. B. Submandibular gland: The submandibular gland is located within the submandibular space, but it does not divide the sublingual and submandibular spaces. C. Body of mandible: The body of the mandible is the lower jawbone and does not directly divide the sublingual and submandibular spaces. D. Geniohyoid: The geniohyoid muscle is located in the neck and does not directly divide the sublingual and submandibular spaces. Based on the above analysis, none of the options provided divide the sublingual space from the submandibular space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above\"}"
