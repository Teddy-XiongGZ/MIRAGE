    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Expansion of the contrast filled space in myelography is typically seen in intradural extramedullary tumors. These tumors arise from the meninges or nerve roots within the spinal canal but outside the spinal cord. Intramedullary tumors, on the other hand, arise from within the spinal cord itself and do not cause expansion of the contrast filled space. Spinal dysraphism refers to a group of congenital abnormalities of the spine and is not typically associated with expansion of the contrast filled space. Extradural tumors are located outside the dura mater and also do not cause expansion of the contrast filled space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
