    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"CSF leakage can be diagnosed by various methods. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Tram Line: Tram Line sign is a radiological finding seen on CT scan or MRI, which indicates the presence of a CSF leak. Therefore, this option can be used to diagnose CSF leakage.\\n\\nB. \u03b2 2-transferrin level: \u03b2 2-transferrin is a specific protein found in CSF but not in other body fluids. Therefore, measuring the \u03b2 2-transferrin level in a fluid sample can help diagnose CSF leakage.\\n\\nC. Increase in glucose: CSF glucose levels are normally lower than blood glucose levels. However, an increase in CSF glucose is not a specific finding for CSF leakage and can be seen in other conditions such as meningitis.\\n\\nD. Increase in proteins: An increase in CSF proteins can be seen in various conditions including CSF leakage. Therefore, this option can be used to diagnose CSF leakage.\\n\\nBased on the above evaluation, option C (increase in glucose) is the answer as it is not a specific finding for CSF leakage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
