    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which statement is not true about the property of polymethyl methacrylate, we need to evaluate each statement one by one. Let's analyze each statement: \\n\\nA. KHN 18-20: This statement refers to the Knoop hardness number (KHN) of polymethyl methacrylate. If this statement is true, it means that the KHN of polymethyl methacrylate falls within the range of 18-20. \\n\\nB. Chemical stable if heated till 260 degree F: This statement suggests that polymethyl methacrylate remains chemically stable when heated up to 260 degrees Fahrenheit. \\n\\nC. Modulus of elasticity is 2.4 GPa: This statement states that the modulus of elasticity of polymethyl methacrylate is 2.4 gigapascals (GPa). \\n\\nD. Tensile strength 29 MPa: This statement indicates that the tensile strength of polymethyl methacrylate is 29 megapascals (MPa). \\n\\nWe need to find the statement that is not true. Let's evaluate each option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
