    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most commonly used technique for determining the working length of a tooth is the tactile sensation method. This involves using an instrument, such as an endodontic file, to gently probe the root canal until a slight resistance or 'tug-back' is felt. This indicates that the file has reached the apex of the tooth. However, in the case of an 8-year-old child patient with a maxillary central incisor, the root canal may not be fully developed yet. Therefore, the tactile sensation method may not be reliable in this situation. Instead, the moisture on paperpoint method is commonly used for determining the working length in children. This involves placing a small piece of absorbent paper, called a paperpoint, into the root canal and checking for moisture. If the paperpoint comes out dry, it indicates that the working length has been reached. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Moisture on paperpoint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
