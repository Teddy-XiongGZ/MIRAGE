    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The most effective immediate action for a child who accidentally swallows a 10% fluoride solution is to have the child drink milk or some other calcium-containing liquid. Fluoride is a toxic substance, and ingesting a large amount can lead to fluoride poisoning. Calcium can help to bind with the fluoride and reduce its absorption in the body. Drinking copious quantities of water (option A) may help dilute the fluoride solution, but it does not provide any specific antidote. Drinking a 100/0 sodium bicarbonate solution (option B) is not recommended as it can potentially worsen the situation. Sending the child to the family physician (option D) may be necessary for further evaluation and treatment, but it is not the most effective immediate action.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}"
