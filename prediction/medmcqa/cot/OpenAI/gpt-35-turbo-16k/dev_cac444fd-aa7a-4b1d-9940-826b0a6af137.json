    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Chronic gingival inflammation is typically caused by the accumulation of dental plaque and the body's immune response to it. Neutrophils, macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and plasma cells are all involved in the immune response. Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and inflammation, and they play a role in the initial stages of gingival inflammation. Macrophages are responsible for phagocytosis and antigen presentation, and they also contribute to chronic inflammation. T-lymphocytes are involved in the adaptive immune response and can contribute to chronic inflammation. Plasma cells produce antibodies, which can also contribute to chronic inflammation. Therefore, none of these options are not responsible for chronic gingival inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}"
