    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"A condylar fracture refers to a fracture of the condyle, which is the rounded portion at the end of the mandible (lower jaw) that articulates with the temporal bone to form the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). When a condylar fracture leads to disruption of the TMJ anteriorly, it means that the fracture extends towards the front of the joint. A simple fracture refers to a fracture where the bone breaks but does not penetrate the skin. A compound fracture refers to a fracture where the bone breaks and penetrates the skin. A complex fracture refers to a fracture where the bone breaks into multiple fragments. A comminuted fracture refers to a fracture where the bone breaks into multiple pieces or fragments. Based on the information provided, a condylar fracture that leads to disruption of the TMJ anteriorly would most likely be classified as a complex fracture, as it involves multiple fragments and extends towards the front of the joint.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Complex fracture\"}"
