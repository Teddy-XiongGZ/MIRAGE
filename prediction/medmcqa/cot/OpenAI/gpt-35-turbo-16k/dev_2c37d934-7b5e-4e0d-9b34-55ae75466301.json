    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In a radical neck dissection, multiple structures are removed to treat head and neck cancers. The aim is to remove lymph nodes, surrounding soft tissues, and sometimes nerves. The spinal accessory nerve (also known as cranial nerve XI) is typically preserved during a radical neck dissection to minimize postoperative complications such as shoulder dysfunction. The submandibular gland is not typically removed in a radical neck dissection unless it is involved with the tumor. The tail of the parotid gland is also not routinely removed unless it is involved with the tumor. Level 2b lymph nodes are typically removed in a radical neck dissection as they are part of the lymphatic drainage system of the head and neck region. Therefore, the structure that is not removed in a radical neck dissection is the submandibular gland.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
