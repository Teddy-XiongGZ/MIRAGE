    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue can be caused by various factors. Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Over extended lingual borders: This refers to the extension of dental restorations beyond the normal boundaries of the tongue. While this can cause discomfort and irritation, it is unlikely to specifically cause numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue.\\n\\nB. Sharp and rough lingual borders: Similar to over extended lingual borders, sharp and rough lingual borders can cause irritation and discomfort, but they are not likely to be the primary cause of numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue.\\n\\nC. Allergy to residual monomer of acrylic: This refers to an allergic reaction to the residual monomer used in acrylic dental materials. Allergic reactions can cause various symptoms, including numbness and tingling sensation. However, this reaction would typically affect the entire mouth and not just the anterior one third of the tongue.\\n\\nD. Excessive vertical dimension: The vertical dimension refers to the height of the teeth when the jaws are closed. Excessive vertical dimension can lead to various symptoms, including muscle strain and nerve compression, which can cause numbness and tingling sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue. Therefore, this is the most likely cause among the given options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
