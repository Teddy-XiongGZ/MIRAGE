    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The spinal cord is a long, cylindrical structure that extends from the base of the brain to the level of the first or second lumbar vertebrae. It is important to note that the spinal cord does not extend the entire length of the vertebral column. Instead, it terminates at a specific level in adults. To determine the level at which the spinal cord ends, we can refer to the anatomical landmarks of the vertebral column.
