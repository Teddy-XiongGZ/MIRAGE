    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To expose the submandibular duct via intraoral approach, we need to identify the structures that need to be incised. The submandibular duct runs from the submandibular gland to the floor of the mouth. It passes through the buccinator muscle, which is located in the cheek. Therefore, the buccinator muscle needs to be incised to expose the submandibular duct. The mucous membrane covers the inner lining of the oral cavity, including the buccinator muscle. So, incising the mucous membrane is also necessary. The masseter muscle, on the other hand, is not directly involved in exposing the submandibular duct. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
