    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The cranial nerves are a set of 12 pairs of nerves that originate from the brain and control various functions of the head and neck. One of these functions is olfaction, or the sense of smell. The cranial nerve responsible for olfaction is the olfactory nerve, which is cranial nerve I. Therefore, the cranial nerve that is not involved in olfaction would be any cranial nerve other than the olfactory nerve. Let's go through the options: A. Glossopharyngeal: The glossopharyngeal nerve, also known as cranial nerve IX, is responsible for taste sensation in the posterior third of the tongue, as well as other functions such as swallowing and salivation. It is not involved in olfaction. B. Vagus: The vagus nerve, also known as cranial nerve X, is responsible for various functions such as controlling the muscles of the throat and voice box, regulating heart rate and digestion. It is not involved in olfaction. C. Hypoglossal: The hypoglossal nerve, also known as cranial nerve XII, is responsible for controlling the muscles of the tongue. It is not involved in olfaction. D. Trigeminal: The trigeminal nerve, also known as cranial nerve V, is responsible for sensation in the face, including touch, pain, and temperature. It is not involved in olfaction. Based on this information, the cranial nerve that is not involved in olfaction is D. Trigeminal.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
