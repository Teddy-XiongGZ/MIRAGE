    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The setting time of zinc phosphate is the time it takes for the material to harden after mixing the powder and liquid components. To retard the setting time means to slow down the hardening process. A. Increasing the ratio of powder to liquid would actually accelerate the setting time, as there would be more powder available to react with the liquid. B. Diluting the liquid with water would also accelerate the setting time, as it would increase the amount of liquid available for the powder to react with. C. Increasing the addition of powder to liquid would also accelerate the setting time, as there would be more powder available to react with the liquid. D. Decreasing the addition of powder to liquid would retard the setting time, as there would be less powder available to react with the liquid. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Decrease the addition of powder to liquid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}"
