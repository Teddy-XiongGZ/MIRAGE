    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Von Gierke's disease is a glycogen storage disease characterized by a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in gluconeogenesis, which is the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. As a result, patients with Von Gierke's disease have impaired glucose production and are prone to hypoglycemia. In order to compensate for the lack of glucose, the body starts breaking down fatty acids for energy through a process called ketogenesis. This leads to the production of ketone bodies, resulting in ketosis. Therefore, the reasons responsible for ketosis in a patient of Von Gierke's disease are: A. They have hypoglycemia and B. Have low blood sugar levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A/B\"}"
