    "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The function of filtration process while taking radiographs is to remove the portion of long wavelength photons. Filtration is used to selectively remove low-energy photons from the x-ray beam, which helps to improve image quality and reduce patient dose. Short wavelength photons are more likely to be absorbed by the patient's body, so removing them would increase the radiation dose to the patient, which is not the purpose of filtration. Similarly, increasing scatter of secondary radiation is not the purpose of filtration.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}"
